Batteries are already a pretty extreme production and cost concern (roughly half the value of an EV is just the battery), and increasing the number of battery packs would inevitably mean increasing costs for the consumers who buy the EV.\",\n",

    "            \"answer\": \"There are two answers. Neither of them very clear. One personally, and two society-wise. Both depend on risk. The first to your self , the second as a group.   Your risk is based on how likely you are to actually cross paths with someone infectious and how likely that is to cause you serious harm. So are you in an at risk group and where are you are considerations.   The second - how likely you are to be part of a chain of infection, how at risk are the people around you and how well society - such as the health service is coping.   Masks not perfect and life always holds a risk. In the West we have never masked up for flu which kills thousands of people a year - around 20,000 in the U.K. annually I think - though we vaccinate the at risk. Possibly COVId may have some nasty long term consequences even if you dint get seriously ill. But if the consequences of COVID dropped to equivalent to flu , then it would hardly be unreasonable to behave in a similar way. I say that nit to suggest we wait till then ( if it ever happened) but as a comparative starting point. No one can really say at what precise point in infections and consequences between that \\u2018flu\\u2019 point and the worst of COVID is the point at which we are \\u2018safe\\u2019.   I expect government ps will come up with a balance of infection rates, hospitalisations and economics with a dose of politics.   Bear in mind that in the East people regularly wear masks on public transport so as either not to do catch viruses or not to spread them , I guess it\\u2019s just considered normal hygiene even for colds.   That\\u2019s a long winded way of saying that presuming you are not mandated by the governments and pretty much everyone has had access to a vaccine you will have to decide whether you feel either at risk yourself, or feel that you need to still protect other people.   Personally I feel like the vaccine plus some lowering of case rates make me feel safe enough - but I wear one sometimes out of consideration to people around me who are still wearing them or in particularly crowded and enclosed environments or both.\",\n",

    "            \"question\": \"eli5: Why do commonly used items, such as CRT's or old consoles skyrocket in value after they stop production? Assuming that these items stopped production today, why do sealed boxes or hell even good condition second-hand items almost double in price mere weeks after the end of production?\",\n",
    "            \"answer\": \"CRTs have some advantages over LCDs and other flat-panel display technologies that matter for certain niche applications. To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That's more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don't care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it's turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.  Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you're dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0). So e.g. if you really want to buy a NES today, your options are very limited as you're dependent on the ever-decreasing number of NES's in the world that still work, *and* that people are willing to sell. So even though very few people are looking to buy NES's, the supply is even smaller.  I'm not sure it's accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I'm happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up. Also, often consoles that go out of production are superseded by newer models and the bulk of the demand will switch to them, while the collectors' market will take years to get off the ground. The only exception I can think of would be if the manufacturer (for some atypical reason) stopped producing the console before they had exhausted the (profitable) demand for it (and didn't release a new console yet).\",\n",

    "            \"answer\": \"Tiny changes in those small animals allow them to fulfill different niches and avoid competition.  A tiny change in a crocodiles morphology wouldn't do as much the separate it from the other croc species.    Ex.  A slight change in the size of a birds beak (I know I changed examples but still) will change its primary food source.  A small change in a crocs mouth.. will still make it be a top predator.\",\n",
