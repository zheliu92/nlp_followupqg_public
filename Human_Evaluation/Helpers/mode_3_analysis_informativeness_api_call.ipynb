    "#         A Follow-Up Question (FUQ) is considered **answerable** if it contains **any relevant information** that connects to the answer in some way.  \n",
    "#         The answer does **not** need to be explicit, as long as it provides **some useful context** that **relates to** or **touches on** the FUQ's topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#         1. **Direct Coverage** ✅  \n",
    "#         - The answer explicitly provides the required information.  \n",
    "#         - No inference is needed.  \n",
    "#         - Example:  \n",
    "#             - FUQ: \"What is blackbody radiation?\"  \n",
    "#             - OA: \"Blackbody radiation occurs when hot objects emit their own light.\"  \n",
    "#             - ✅ Answerable by OA.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#         2. **Loose Inferability (Minimal Context Needed) ✅**  \n",
    "#         - The answer **does not directly answer** the FUQ but provides **some level of relevant context**, even if vague.  \n",
    "#         - If **some background knowledge** allows for a connection, it should be marked as answerable.  \n",
    "#         - Example:  \n",
    "#             - FUQ: \"How do blackbody radiation and white light differ in intensity?\"  \n",
    "#             - OA: \"Sufficiently hot objects produce their own light, a process called blackbody radiation.\"  \n",
    "#             - ✅ Answerable by OA (since blackbody radiation involves emitted light, a connection to intensity can be made).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#         3. **Any Shared Concept Counts** ✅  \n",
    "#         - If the FUQ **mentions a topic** that appears in the OA or CA, it should be considered answerable.  \n",
    "#         - Even if the answer does **not fully explain** the FUQ, **any overlap** makes it answerable.  \n",
    "#         - Example:  \n",
    "#             - FUQ: \"What are some examples of high-energy emitting materials?\"  \n",
    "#             - OA: \"Torches, incandescent bulbs, and the sun emit light through blackbody radiation.\"  \n",
    "#             - ✅ Answerable by OA (mention of blackbody radiation implies high-energy emission).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#         4. **Very Flexible Scope** ✅  \n",
    "#         - The FUQ **should be marked as answerable unless it is completely unrelated**.  \n",
    "#         - If **even a minor part** of the FUQ is **somewhat addressed**, it should be considered answerable.  \n",
    "#         - Example:  \n",
    "#             - FUQ: \"How does thermal decomposition contribute to the emission of white light?\"  \n",
    "#             - OA: \"Sufficiently hot objects produce their own light.\"  \n",
    "#             - ✅ Answerable by OA (mention of heat and light emission allows for an inference).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#         5. **Extreme Leniency for Partial Answers** ✅  \n",
    "#         - A FUQ **does not have to be fully answered** to be considered answerable.  \n",
    "#         - Even if the answer **only hints at the topic** or **briefly addresses it**, it should be marked as answerable.  \n",
    "#         - Example:  \n",
    "#             - FUQ: \"How does the wavelength of light affect its energy?\"  \n",
    "#             - OA: \"Sufficiently hot objects emit their own light.\"  \n",
    "#             - ✅ Answerable by OA (even though the full explanation isn't there, it touches on emitted light). \n",

    "\n",
    "#         3. **Do NOT include escape characters ('\\') or newline characters ('\\n').**  \n",

    "\n",

    "#         - **ONLY return the structured list** and nothing else.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#         6. **POST-PROCESSING:**\n",

    "    \"answer\": \"Animals can get sunburned like we do, pigs for example root in mud to cool off and because mud is a form of sun protection. Animals with fur cannot get sunburned where and when the fur covers them but can get burned on their lips and eyelids.\",\n",
    "    \"complete_answer\": \"Yes, some animals can tan. Similar to humans, certain animals produce more melanin when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) rays, which darkens their skin or fur as a protective measure against the harmful effects of the sun. For example, the skin of cattle and horses can exhibit a tanning response to prolonged sun exposure.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that most animals have evolved natural protections such as fur, feathers, or scales which shield them from UV radiation. These natural barriers significantly reduce the need for tanning, as they already provide effective protection against sun damage.\\n\\nIn addition to tanning, some animals have developed behaviors to protect themselves from the sun. For instance, animals like pigs and hippopotamuses can sunburn but do not tan. Instead, they may wallow in mud or water to cool down and create a barrier against the sun's rays. Elephants, similarly, use dust or mud to cover their skin, acting as a natural sunscreen.\\n\\nThese behavioral adaptations are crucial for these species as they provide physical protection against UV radiation, reducing the risk of sunburn. By employing such methods, animals demonstrate diverse strategies for managing sun exposure, whether through physiological changes like tanning or through specific behaviors aimed at safeguarding their skin from the sun's harmful effects.\"\n",
