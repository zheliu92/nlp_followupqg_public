The reason you often have to do some sneaking is because the person who you are repo’ing from obviously doesn’t want you to take the vehicle, and will resist you taking it.   You do have the legal right to take the property, however you have limited power to use any force. So if the person sees you about to repo their car, and decides to jump into the car, you can not physically remove them. You also can not tow the car with them inside it. If you can block the car from leaving it’s current location then you have every right to call the police, and they will gladly force the person to get out, and assist you with the repo.

If I recall, most meat and stuff could be eaten raw until salmonella and e-coli became rampant. This isn’t to say that you could leave raw meat out and eat it, no, but you could definitely eat meat from a fresh kill. Nowadays there’s too much risk, especially from mass meat production.', ""CRTs have some advantages over LCDs and other flat-panel display technologies that matter for certain niche applications. To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That's more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don't care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it's turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.  Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you're dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0). So e.g. if you really want to buy a NES today, your options are very limited as you're dependent on the ever-decreasing number of NES's in the world that still work, *and* that people are willing to sell. So even though very few people are looking to buy NES's, the supply is even smaller.  I'm not sure it's accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I'm happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up. Also, often consoles that go out of production are superseded by newer models and the bulk of the demand will switch to them, while the collectors' market will take years to get off the ground. The only exception I can think of would be if the manufacturer (for some atypical reason) stopped producing the console before they had exhausted the (profitable) demand for it (and didn't release a new console yet)."", 'I think your premise is wrong.

Why do they want you to look at a screen? You may ask.  Advertising.  Companies want to make money, and in order to do this they need to let people know about their products.

Where before, they would\'ve advertised on a certain website, or in a certain area, advertisers can now target specific people. People they know like the kind of things they are selling.

To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That's more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don't care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it's turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.  Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you're dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0).

So even though very few people are looking to buy NES's, the supply is even smaller.  I'm not sure it's accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I'm happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up.

To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That's more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don't care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it's turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.

So even though very few people are looking to buy NES's, the supply is even smaller.  I'm not sure it's accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I'm happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up.

But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.

Why do they want you to look at a screen? You may ask.  Advertising.  Companies want to make money, and in order to do this they need to let people know about their products. But advertising your products costs a lot of money when you are trying to reach a wider audience.  So they target specific demographics.  Where before, they would\'ve advertised on a certain website, or in a certain area, advertisers can now target specific people. People they know like the kind of things they are selling. People of a particular age and gender who like to purchase products similar to yours.  By targeting more specifically, they have more chance of making a sale per dollar spent on advertising. So companies who harvest data from us sell it to 3rd party advertisers.

To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That's more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don't care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it's turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.  Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you're dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0). So e.g. if you really want to buy a NES today, your options are very limited as you're dependent on the ever-decreasing number of NES's in the world that still work, *and* that people are willing to sell. So even though very few people are looking to buy NES's, the supply is even smaller.  I'm not sure it's accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I'm happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up. Also, often consoles that go out of production are superseded by newer models and the bulk of the demand will switch to them, while the collectors' market will take years to get off the ground. The only exception I can think of would be if the manufacturer (for some atypical reason) stopped producing the console before they had exhausted the (profitable) demand for it (and didn't release a new console yet)."", 'I think your premise is wrong.

Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you're dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0). So e.g. if you really want to buy a NES today, your options are very limited as you're dependent on the ever-decreasing number of NES's in the world that still work, *and* that people are willing to sell. So even though very few people are looking to buy NES's, the supply is even smaller.  I'm not sure it's accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I'm happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up. Also, often consoles that go out of production are superseded by newer models and the bulk of the demand will switch to them, while the collectors' market will take years to get off the ground. The only exception I can think of would be if the manufacturer (for some atypical reason) stopped producing the console before they had exhausted the (profitable) demand for it (and didn't release a new console yet)."", 'I think your premise is wrong.

To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price.

If I recall, most meat and stuff could be eaten raw until salmonella and e-coli became rampant. This isn’t to say that you could leave raw meat out and eat it, no, but you could definitely eat meat from a fresh kill. Nowadays there’s too much risk, especially from mass meat production.', ""CRTs have some advantages over LCDs and other flat-panel display technologies that matter for certain niche applications. To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That's more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don't care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it's turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.  Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you're dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0). So e.g. if you really want to buy a NES today, your options are very limited as you're dependent on the ever-decreasing number of NES's in the world that still work, *and* that people are willing to sell. So even though very few people are looking to buy NES's, the supply is even smaller.  I'm not sure it's accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I'm happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up. Also, often consoles that go out of production are superseded by newer models and the bulk of the demand will switch to them, while the collectors' market will take years to get off the ground. The only exception I can think of would be if the manufacturer (for some atypical reason) stopped producing the console before they had exhausted the (profitable) demand for it (and didn't release a new console yet)."", 'I think your premise is wrong.

To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That's more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don't care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it's turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.  Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you're dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0). So e.g. if you really want to buy a NES today, your options are very limited as you're dependent on the ever-decreasing number of NES's in the world that still work, *and* that people are willing to sell. So even though very few people are looking to buy NES's, the supply is even smaller.  I'm not sure it's accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I'm happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up. Also, often consoles that go out of production are superseded by newer models and the bulk of the demand will switch to them, while the collectors' market will take years to get off the ground.

To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That's more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don't care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it's turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.  Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you're dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0).

So even though very few people are looking to buy NES's, the supply is even smaller.  I'm not sure it's accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I'm happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up.

To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That's more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don't care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it's turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.  Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you're dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0).

By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up.

The reason you often have to do some sneaking is because the person who you are repo’ing from obviously doesn’t want you to take the vehicle, and will resist you taking it.   You do have the legal right to take the property, however you have limited power to use any force. So if the person sees you about to repo their car, and decides to jump into the car, you can not physically remove them. You also can not tow the car with them inside it. If you can block the car from leaving it’s current location then you have every right to call the police, and they will gladly force the person to get out, and assist you with the repo.

Then wake up early with fresh sunlight every morning for the next few days and you should be entrained back to the regular circadian rhythm !

Nowadays there’s too much risk, especially from mass meat production.', ""CRTs have some advantages over LCDs and other flat-panel display technologies that matter for certain niche applications. To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That's more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don't care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it's turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.  Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you're dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0). So e.g. if you really want to buy a NES today, your options are very limited as you're dependent on the ever-decreasing number of NES's in the world that still work, *and* that people are willing to sell. So even though very few people are looking to buy NES's, the supply is even smaller.  I'm not sure it's accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I'm happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up. Also, often consoles that go out of production are superseded by newer models and the bulk of the demand will switch to them, while the collectors' market will take years to get off the ground. The only exception I can think of would be if the manufacturer (for some atypical reason) stopped producing the console before they had exhausted the (profitable) demand for it (and didn't release a new console yet)."", 'I think your premise is wrong.

Why do they want you to look at a screen? You may ask.  Advertising.  Companies want to make money, and in order to do this they need to let people know about their products. But advertising your products costs a lot of money when you are trying to reach a wider audience.  So they target specific demographics.  Where before, they would\'ve advertised on a certain website, or in a certain area, advertisers can now target specific people. People they know like the kind of things they are selling. People of a particular age and gender who like to purchase products similar to yours.  By targeting more specifically, they have more chance of making a sale per dollar spent on advertising. So companies who harvest data from us sell it to 3rd party advertisers. And with the amount of people putting their entire lives online, and the amount of money that can be made from selling stuff to them, means it\'s a big money business.  Then there\'s the illegal side of the industry.

If I give you a map and tell you that I'm fifteen miles away from this particular point, then you can map out a thirty-mile-wide circle where I can be anywhere along the circumference.  If I give you another point and say that I'm a certain distance away from *that* point as well, you can narrow down where I could be based on the intersection of the two circles.  A third point/distance pair is sufficient to get a single approximate location, and further pairs refine the location further, as well as providing redundancy in case of signal loss.
