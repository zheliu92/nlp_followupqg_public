3070,ELI5: How can you convert liabilities to equity?,"There are two primary ways for a company to raise money: taking on liabilities (selling bonds or taking other loans) and selling equity in the company (stock).  You are correct, if a company has $1 million in bonds issued or loans taken, they are in $1 million of debt. However, they can create a stock offering for investors to buy equity in the company for $1 million. Then they can take the $1 million generated from the sale of stock and use it to pay off their liabilities. Thus, turning liability into equity.","Oh ok I see, makes sense now. So essentially there will be more shareholders and thus more equity, but the liabilities would still have to be paid in the long run. Why is this conversion usually seen as a good thing?",Related,What are the benefits of using a combination of equity and bonds to raise money?
