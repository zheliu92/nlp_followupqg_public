3060,ELI5: Orange lies between red and yellow on the spectrum and can be made by mixing red and yellow pigments. Then how come violet can be made by mixing red and blue even though it doesn't lie between them on the spectrum?,"Purple is essentially a color our brains made up. It's how we interpret light that has lots of red wavelengths and lots of blue wavelengths, but little to no green. The purples are not ""spectral colors"" meaning they don't correspond to a single wavelength of light.  ""Violet"" is weird because it is actually is a spectral color, it's the lowest possible wavelength without being ultraviolet and thus invisible to the human eye. Because our eyes aren't very sensitive to this wavelength ""true"" violet usually looks dark and hard to see.","Ok that makes sense. But then the question is: do we know why our brains assign the same or similar perceived color for a mix of blue and red (purple) as ""true"" violet?",Strongly Related,What role does the CCD (Covalent Chromatography) system play in the creation of specific colors?

3062,ELI5: Why do we feel sick when we get hungry sometimes? It seems counter productive.,"This is only the case in some instances, but with an 'empty' stomach the PH level of the stomach 'juice' is higher, which is irritating, especially if it gets into your oesophagus.  A condition called GORD (Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease), also known as heartburn or acid-reflux, is when the stomach acid gets into the oesophagus and for some people this is very common, especially those with a loose seal between the stomach and food pipe, most commonly caused by a 'hiatus hernia'.  This means when the stomach is empty, the stomach and oesopagus become irritated and it can lead to throwing up, or feeling we need to throw up.  However, this is not the only reason, just one reason. If eating food like a banana or having antacid medication makes such nausea go away, chances are this is the cause.

3063,"ELI5: If my VR headset display has a limited and certain amount of pixels, how do games upscale pixel density beyond full resolution?","I believe you're talking about VR Supersampling. Essential your computer screen (or VR screens in this case) can only output a certain resolution of pixels.(this is called the ""Native resolution"") Each pixel can only display one color at a time. When these pixels do not line up perfectly vertically or horizontally they can look jagged. (Imagine drawing a straight line on MS paint: totally smooth. Now draw a 45° angled line: looks like a staircase) This jagged effect is called aliasing. To mitigate this effect, games offer anti-aliasing features such as Supersampling.  Supersampling renders an image at a higher resolution than the computer screen can output, takes an average of the pixel colors in an area and blends them all together, displaying the blended colors at the native resolution. This sort of smooths the edges of those not perfectly straight lines so that they appear less jagged and more natural.   So, your screen is still displaying the same amount of pixels, and the pixels are only displaying one color each, but the colors displayed by each pixel are slightly different.","Are you referring to SSAA?

3069,ELI5: Why don't dentists and eye doctors have to go to regular medical school?,"The simplest explanation is that dentistry and optometristry are more about tools and minimally invasive procedures than they are about internal biology.
