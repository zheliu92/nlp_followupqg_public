3172,ELI5: What's the difference between a cult and a religion?,"My father was a cult deprogrammer in the 1970’s and early 80’s. There is a definition of a cult.   A cult is a religious organization based on control, who uses that control to remove negative influence about the cult towards the members to exert control over the belief system and remove rational thought about it.  Normal beliefs have a cycle to their creation:  1.  Idea - what is the thesis?  2.  Positive reinforcement - what are all the thoughts that support the idea?  3. Negative reinforcement - what are all the things that go against the thesis and make it not true?  4.  Reflection - weighing the positive against the negative in reflective thought  5.  Belief - what is your conclusion after considering the thesis from other angles and hearing from multiple perspectives on the issue.   Cults remove #3 and because of that you have no negative reinforcement. No negative and there is only positive going into reflection. So you get a fast track to belief.  A cult is anything where your beliefs must match the rest or you are berated, abused, or expelled from the group and the relationships with any members are based completely on your acceptance of said beliefs.","So, not trying to be humorous here, what's the tipping point for a cult to become a religion and vice versa? I'm genuinely thinking of the religious right in America at the moment and their sincere belief that Trump is God-appointed. It genuinely seems to be like they've self-removed #3 through the constant attacks on science, fact and reasoning.   I ask this genuinely. I'd be interested in hearing from those in that camp.

3173,eli5: Why are galaxies 'flat' instead of a sphere ?,"If we were to spin a ball very, very quickly, we'd expect the ball to deform. It would begin to bulge out in the middle, then bulge more and more. When we spin it extremely fast it would flatten into a disc.           That's intuitive, because we're used to seeing things spin quickly.  Galaxies though, don't look to be spinning at all.  Intuitively, it seems like everything should just fall into the middle and form a sphere.         What's not intuitive is that you don't need to spin quickly if you have a lot of mass, and *galaxies have an awful lot of mass*.       Imagine we had two balls - one filled with polystyrene balls from a bean bag, the other fillled with steel ball bearings.  We spin both balls faster and faster.  The one with the ball bearings will deform sooner.  The  bulge will appear sooner and it will flatten into a disc sooner.

3174,"ELI5 We all hear that the healthcare industry in the US is really screwed up, but why? How did it come to be this way and what can reasonably be done to make it more fair and affordable for the general public?","The medical industry, and specifically the medical insurance industry is very heavily regulated.  Also the US norm of having insurance tied to your job creates problems.  A solution would be to decouple insurance from employment.  If your employer provides benefits, there’s a “total compensation” number somewhere on the books.  Like if your salary is 50k plus benefits, it’s likely costing the company 75k to employ you.  Instead of the company providing insurance, if the compensation became just pay you 75k, but no benefits, with a more open market option for health insurance, like there is for home or auto insurance, more options could emerge.  You’re someone young and healthy with no kids? Sure, here’s a plan that is dirt cheap, but doesn’t cover much beyond catastrophic accidents/illness.  You’re married and have 3 kids? Here’s a plan that costs a bit more and covers more.  You’re a hypochondriac that’s constantly convinced you’re dying?  Here’s a plan that covers everything imaginable, but you’re going to have to pay a lot for it.  Another option is tort reform for lawsuits.  High risk medical fields like OB, surgeons, etc have to carry enormous levels of malpractice insurance and liability.  If they’re in private practice, premiums can run into the 6 figures.  This decreases the amount of people willing to assume that level of risk, meaning shortages.  Any time there’s a shortage, price goes up.  So reducing the ability to sue a doctor for millions of dollars for something that isn’t blatantly their incompetence (like an injury to mom or baby when giving birth, even if all protocols and good practices were followed) could help too, because then there’d be lower risk to such fields and more people would want to go into them, meaning wait times and price could go down.","Thanks for taking time to respond! Not trying to come across as ignorant because I genuinely don’t know, but isn’t the purpose of your employer covering insurance for you because they’re a large corporation and have the leverage to negotiate with insurance companies for better rates?

To offset this, hospitals jack up prices to have insurance or more economically stable citizens cover the difference.. except as prices get higher, insurance gets higher and the amount of people that can afford the bills get smaller. More people fall into the category that can’t pay the hospital bill. So, to cover the difference, prices go up, insurance goes up, and the amount of defaulted medical bills go up.

We left in a worst place we came in on and with a $1700 bill. They tried sending us another $800 bill for  reasons They said as doctor *looked* at his paperwork…We didn’t pay it.   I find it funny when people say they don’t want to pay for other people’s health care because we literally already are and we get nothing back for it.","Seems like it's on a feedback loop too, every year health insurance premiums seem to go up a bit which makes me wonder if fewer people can afford it and the uninsured percentage keeps growing, leading to more and more charge-offs from the hospitals and higher prices.  Like my health insurance for self plus family is $369 per pay period or about $9,600 per year and it seems to increase 5 to 10% per year at least and also every year the deductibles and out of pocket max increases.  It kind of makes me wonder how much it's going to cost in 10 or 20 years...  Like are we going to hit some point where the whole system just collapses because only a quarter of the population can pay it and charge-offs are running rampant?",Related,Why might a lower income family choose to pay the hospital bill instead of using their savings from other medical expenses?
3176,"Eli5, how do lower income families in America afford a trip to the dr/ER?","They don’t. Hospitals can’t turn away living saving care, regardless of financial situation. They treat the patient, send them an outrageous bill and, because it’s outrageous and affects credit they don’t have anyway, they let it lapse. To offset this, hospitals jack up prices to have insurance or more economically stable citizens cover the difference.. except as prices get higher, insurance gets higher and the amount of people that can afford the bills get smaller. More people fall into the category that can’t pay the hospital bill. So, to cover the difference, prices go up, insurance goes up, and the amount of defaulted medical bills go up.   Rinse lather repeat.  And this is why it costs $1500 just to go into the ER. Then they star giving you $800 saline bags for hydration, $500 Tylenol, $200 for the bandaid after they drew blood. You’ll get the $700 lab work bill separately. A doctor walked past you once so that’s $500. You paying that $3200 bill that didn’t actually treat you? Or are you going to be one of the people that lets it default and add to the price hike?   This is almost exactly what happened when my husband’s herniated disc flared up and his pain doctor couldn’t see him for a few days. He couldn’t move!

3177,"ELI5: if a tree has everything it needs to survive for as long as possible and there is no outside influence at all, what internal issue would cause it to die?","I think this question is highly dependent on the tree species. For instance, a Water Oak in perfect conditions will still likely begin rotting from the inside due to too much moisture build up in the trunk and it will collapse within 30-50 years. A Live Oak, however, will continue to grow until it can't support its own weight which takes 250-500 years. Even then, Live Oaks will sometimes just fall over and begin sprouting new trees from the fallen trunk.   These are just two species of tree, but lifespans vary across species by a WIDE margin.","This is basically the most knowledge I have, I knew about falling from there own weight, rotting, etc. what about those trees that literally live for thousands of years?
