3031,"ELI5: What is ""Document Object Model"" (DOM) and how does it work?","The name is pretty self-explanatory - it's a model used to represent a document as a hierarchical structure of objects. To explain in more detail:  The **document** will usually be an XML or HTML document. These are text documents that use markup language to signify different elements:      <p>This is text</p>     <p>This paragraph has a <span>child element</span></p>     <h1>This is a top-level heading</h1>     <img src=""picture.jpg"" alt=""This is the alt text for an embedded image"" />  In DOM each element is represented as an **object**.

An object can have also attributes (src and alt are attributes of the img element object; ""This is text"" is the text attribute of the p element object).  Because these markup languages allow for nested (child) elements, the whole thing can be represented as a tree structure, which is the **model**.

3032,ELI5: What is a zip bomb? Are they dangerous/can they harm your pc?,"A zip bomb is a compressed file that is made in such a way as to be far more efficiently compressed than files usually can be.  Normally you might get a file that compresses to 85% of its original size. What a zip bomb does is compress a file that is made up of many repeating sequences; it is garbage but it can be made much smaller, so the compressed file is fractions of a percent of the uncompressed file.  The result is that when you try to open the archive the computer tries to write an absurdly large file to disk. This cannot really damage the computer, it won't destroy data or anything irreversible, but it can be annoying to fill up all remaining drive space.","Ok, so it’s more of an inconvenience than anything else if you were to get zip bombed?",Related,What are some common uses for zip bombs in online hacking?

3033,ELI5: What is this magical amount of enriched uranium that is needed for a nuclear bomb?; Part 2: Why is it that amount?; Bonus: how close is Iran to that amount?,"It's not magic. A nuclear bomb is an engineering device that creates the conditions for an out-of-control nuclear fission reaction.   Each U-235 atom can be split (fissioned) with a neutron. When it splits, it releases 2-3 neutrons of its own (plus some energy). Each neutron can go only a few centimeters before it disintegrates. For a bomb to work, you need those 2-3 neutrons to split more U-235 atoms, which then split more, which then split more, and so on.   If the amount of uranium you have is too small, the neutrons will eventually reach the surface and escape. The chances of them hitting more U-235 atoms will not be high enough to continue the reaction.  So the ""magic amount"" — the critical mass — is the amount of U-235 you need so that you have the conditions where lots of reactions will take place.   The thing of it is, there are different ways to design a bomb. For example, if you put a neutron reflector around the fuel, those neutrons will have a harder time escaping, so you will need less U-235 for it to work. The main bomb design ""trick"" that people use is called implosion, where you use high explosives to squeeze a ball of fuel into a higher density, so the atoms are closer together — again, to increase the chance of those neutrons finding more atoms.   There are other tricks as well that can be used to increase the efficiency, many of which get beyond ELI5 levels of explanation. The goal of them is to make more material react, which either means you need less material for a given amount of ""boom,"" or you add more fuel and get a bigger explosion.  So the exact amount you need can vary by bomb design. The lower limits are kept pretty secret but it is clear that with 5 kg or even less of material, with a very sophisticated design, you can get a pretty good explosion. For a very crude design, like the one used on Hiroshima (where you are just shooting two pieces of U-235 together), you could need more than 60 kg. So there is a big gap between those two extremes, though in the end even the ""high end"" is not a huge amount.   Separately, with U-235, the level of enrichment (how much U-235 versus U-238 there is) makes a difference to that amount as well. If you have 93% U-235 (7% U-238), you will need less material than, say, 80% U-235 (20% U-238). U-238 inhibits the reaction and so you will need more U-235 to increase the chance of it fissioning.  If this still sounds confusing, you might enjoy playing around with my [Critical Assembly Simulator](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/misc/criticality/), which allows one to simulate in a ""toy"" way how these reactions work. You can tweak the variables (enrichment, total mass, reflection, implosion, etc.) and see how that changes how the reaction operates.   In terms of how close Iran is to the amount, Iran currently has uranium enriched at the level of 20%. That is not enough for a bomb. It is, however, not that far from 90% — a lot less far than it seems (enrichment is not linear; it is more ""work"" to go from 0.7% to 20% than it is 20% to 90%).   To make a bomb, Iran would likely need to build up a stockpile of several dozen kilograms of uranium enriched to at least 80%, more favorable at least 90%. They have said that they will make at most 120 kg of 20% enriched uranium. If they turned all of that into 90% enriched uranium with perfect efficiency, they would have around 25 kg of U-235. That would likely be enough for a few implosion bombs (but not enough for a crude bomb). They would also of course have to do the work of weaponizing it, and need a way to actually launch it (missile warheads, etc.) — not impossible, but these things take additional time and testing.   In terms of ""how close,"" it really depends on what you assume they are going to be doing politically. They do not appear to be trying to make a bomb just yet. They are clearly positioning themselves to make the West uncomfortable, though, with the idea that if they threw everything they had into making a bomb — which would be a very obvious sort of move, and require them flagrantly violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty — they might be able to make the material in a matter of months.   Note that Iran's uranium stockpiles and facilities are under close scrutiny not only by the International Atomic Energy Agency (which has cameras in each of them, linked back to their headquarters in Vienna), but the intelligence services of many nations (USA, Israel, no doubt others). So this would be a very blatant act. It doesn't mean they couldn't try it (North Korea pulled out of the NPT in 2003, and tested a bomb in 2006), but it is not the kind of overnight ""they suddenly secretly have a nuke"" that many people fear.","Thanks man; that was cool to read!

Note that Iran's uranium stockpiles and facilities are under close scrutiny not only by the International Atomic Energy Agency (which has cameras in each of them, linked back to their headquarters in Vienna), but the intelligence services of many nations (USA, Israel, no doubt others).

3033,ELI5: What is this magical amount of enriched uranium that is needed for a nuclear bomb?; Part 2: Why is it that amount?; Bonus: how close is Iran to that amount?,"It's not magic. A nuclear bomb is an engineering device that creates the conditions for an out-of-control nuclear fission reaction.   Each U-235 atom can be split (fissioned) with a neutron. When it splits, it releases 2-3 neutrons of its own (plus some energy). Each neutron can go only a few centimeters before it disintegrates. For a bomb to work, you need those 2-3 neutrons to split more U-235 atoms, which then split more, which then split more, and so on.   If the amount of uranium you have is too small, the neutrons will eventually reach the surface and escape. The chances of them hitting more U-235 atoms will not be high enough to continue the reaction.  So the ""magic amount"" — the critical mass — is the amount of U-235 you need so that you have the conditions where lots of reactions will take place.   The thing of it is, there are different ways to design a bomb. For example, if you put a neutron reflector around the fuel, those neutrons will have a harder time escaping, so you will need less U-235 for it to work. The main bomb design ""trick"" that people use is called implosion, where you use high explosives to squeeze a ball of fuel into a higher density, so the atoms are closer together — again, to increase the chance of those neutrons finding more atoms.   There are other tricks as well that can be used to increase the efficiency, many of which get beyond ELI5 levels of explanation. The goal of them is to make more material react, which either means you need less material for a given amount of ""boom,"" or you add more fuel and get a bigger explosion.  So the exact amount you need can vary by bomb design. The lower limits are kept pretty secret but it is clear that with 5 kg or even less of material, with a very sophisticated design, you can get a pretty good explosion. For a very crude design, like the one used on Hiroshima (where you are just shooting two pieces of U-235 together), you could need more than 60 kg. So there is a big gap between those two extremes, though in the end even the ""high end"" is not a huge amount.   Separately, with U-235, the level of enrichment (how much U-235 versus U-238 there is) makes a difference to that amount as well. If you have 93% U-235 (7% U-238), you will need less material than, say, 80% U-235 (20% U-238). U-238 inhibits the reaction and so you will need more U-235 to increase the chance of it fissioning.  If this still sounds confusing, you might enjoy playing around with my [Critical Assembly Simulator](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/misc/criticality/), which allows one to simulate in a ""toy"" way how these reactions work. You can tweak the variables (enrichment, total mass, reflection, implosion, etc.) and see how that changes how the reaction operates.   In terms of how close Iran is to the amount, Iran currently has uranium enriched at the level of 20%. That is not enough for a bomb. It is, however, not that far from 90% — a lot less far than it seems (enrichment is not linear; it is more ""work"" to go from 0.7% to 20% than it is 20% to 90%).   To make a bomb, Iran would likely need to build up a stockpile of several dozen kilograms of uranium enriched to at least 80%, more favorable at least 90%. They have said that they will make at most 120 kg of 20% enriched uranium. If they turned all of that into 90% enriched uranium with perfect efficiency, they would have around 25 kg of U-235. That would likely be enough for a few implosion bombs (but not enough for a crude bomb). They would also of course have to do the work of weaponizing it, and need a way to actually launch it (missile warheads, etc.) — not impossible, but these things take additional time and testing.

It's simply not managed in the same way a hydroponics system is managed.","> It's naturally balanced to support the plant, but if you disturb that balance (for example, by adding way more water than it would naturally get), it stops being a good environment for plant growth.   This is the best answer.  Both systems (soil/hydroponics) require some form of balance and maintenance. Things like ph, oxygenation, nutrient content matter to both systems.  It's not that water is inherently evil. What the OP's question actually is is ""why is it when I knock my soil system out of whack/balance it damages plants when my carefully maintained hydroponic system doesn't"".  The answer is inherent to the question.  Put differently  ""Why can plants grow just fine in soil when if I add too many minerals and nutrients to my hydroponic system it'll damage them?""",Related,What are some examples of plant diseases that can arise from overwatering in soil compared to hydroponics?
