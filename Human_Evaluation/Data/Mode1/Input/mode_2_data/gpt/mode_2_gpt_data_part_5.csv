3040,eli5: what is API?,Pretend you own a website that tells the weather. You want me to display it on my website. You can create a way for a user to grab todays temperature. Its real simple and like one line of code for me called grab_todays_temp(). On the inside of this function its way more complex. But I can’t see how it works on the inside and I don’t need to know. All I care about is gettin the temperature from your website.,"in this scenario, do you also have to have an API on your end to receive today's temp? or are you given the API by the website and you simply run it in order to grab today's temp?",Related,What are some examples of RESTful APIs used in API development?

3041,"ELI5 - how is DC current converted to AC current, for instance power from solar panels being converted to AC? I know how it can be done mechanically but that must be inefficient.",Usually it will be done by switching powere on and off really fast. That will then go through a circuit that smooths the on off into a actual wave shape.  Same as if your moving your hand up and down in a bath tub. Vertical movement of your hand is smoothed out by the resistance of the water to create a horizontal wave.  The circuits use inductors and capacitors to create filters that resist the change of voltage causing the wave shape.  Edit: I guess terms would be either stable multi vibrators or oscillator.
