3490,eli5: Why did the life expectancy for people with down syndrome increase from 25 years in 1980 to 60 years today?,"During WW2 in Germany and I believe Austria, many kids and babies who were institutionalized for disabilities were killed by being out outside without sufficient clothes so they would get pneumonia and die.   Institutions tend to be mental hospitals or called insane asylums. People there get maintenance care at best.","Why kill by exposure? Wouldn't it be much kinder (Pun originally unintended) to just put a bullet in their head? Obviously not killing them would be kinder than either but since that wasn't an option.  Sure it doesn't have the stigma of killing a child but death from pneumonia is a worse more painful death than from a bullet to the head or being suffocated in their sleep.

3492,Eli5: Who exactly messed up in the Grenfell cladding?,"In engineering risk assessment there is a theory called the cheese model. Imagine many slices of cheese, each with some holes in random positions. Each slice of cheese represents one entity in the engineering project, and holes represent safety holes in that one entity. A risk factor (hole) in one entity can be blocked by another entity. However, sometimes you're unlucky and all the holes align. Everything is at the wrong place at the same time, and disaster happens.   Truth is, humans *will* make mistakes. It is unavoidable. Any attempts to reduce risk *will* cause risks of its own. The best we can do is to have many layers of cheese (safety mechanism) so that the chance of holes aligning (all safety mechanisms failing) is as small as possible. The desire to blame a single entity for disasters is not only wrong, but also makes the entire system prone to future disasters. If we only blame one slice of cheese for the entire disaster, problems in every other slice of cheese is not fixed, or even worse, those holes get larger due to complacency.","Yes, but surely at least one of the factors I mentioned should be major factor? If the standards were perfect, the panels accurately tested and properly installed, and the appropriate cladding was used this wouldn't have happened? This wasn't a freak accident, this was a known issue with this type of cladding that has been reproduced elsewhere and has caused other fires before and after - although none as dramatic.   I get that most engineering disasters nowadays cannot be narrowed down to such a small amount of issues - but this seems to be an exception to the rule. This sort of fire was, with the benefit of hindsight, entirely predictable based on the pre existing conditions wasn't it?
