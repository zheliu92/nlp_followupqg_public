3381,Eli5 how do conjoined twins operate their bodies?,"Who controls what varies hugely between individuals, because body and brain structure is unique. The connections made by the two brains during fetal development to different body parts and functions is random. So in some sets of twins, one twin may control one arm and leg, and the other controls the others. In another set, one twin may only control one arm or leg. In some cases one twin may have full function of everything and the other twin can’t control anything.    In situations were both twins each control half the body, They must coordinate to be able to perform tasks like walking efficiently. Because they are like this right out of the womb, it’s normal for them and they learn how to coordinate movements during infancy, just as a person with a regular body would learn to walk.","I presume it wouldn’t be possible that they both have control of all parts? So that they could both lift the left arm, just not at the same time.   I would think that would be impossible because that would mean that if one wants to move it up, and the other wants to lower it.

3382,"ELI5; Why/how do cells assemble themselves into humans? How do they 'know' where to go? Like, is it something to do with charge? Because after all, they're just made of molecules, they don't have brains.","They don't have complex brains, but they do have proteins/genetics/hormones and can respond to those. Proteins and hormones can be used to stimulate certain behaviors in cells. Genetics are the blueprint for the entire body, but parts of those genes can be shut-down by proteins/hormones, so that the cell only works off of a specific set of genes (say, for muscle cells instead of for fat cells). Epigenetics is where those genetic changes can be inherited, so a muscle cell will only ever divide/reproduce into muscle cell, never into a fat cell.  All humans start from a single cell, the fertilized egg. From there it divides over and over again, each time using nutrients to make more cells. Those cells start becoming specialized (as described above) and keep dividing and specializing until they form a whole human baby. The process continues outside the womb until they're a grown human adult.","Well then how do genetics work? Like, DNA are carbon-based molecules, right?
