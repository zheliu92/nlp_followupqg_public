3420,ELI5: What is an Eigenvalue and an Eigenvector?,"In the language of vectors and matrices; A geometric vector is basically something with a length and direction. You can transform vectors by multiplying matrices by them, for example a rotation of 180 degrees in 2D can be represented by the matrix  |\-1|0| |:-|:-| |0|\-1|  If you multiply any vector by this matrix then it will rotate it around 180 degrees.  Now most matrices aren't that simple and they will do a combination of operations, changing the length and direction of vectors in complex ways.For a given matrix an eigenvector is one which doesn't have its direction changed, i.e only its length is scaled when you multiply it by that matrix. The eigenvalue is how much that length is scaled.  For example if we have some matrix M and a vector (3,5). Then say we multiply M\*V and get a new vector (6,10) which = 2\*(3,5). This means V is an eigenvector of M with an eigenvalue of 2, applying M to V has just scaled it by a factor 2 without changing its direction.",Isn't the 180 degree rotation matrix just multiplying by -1? Or do negatives don't count?,Related,What is the significance of the eigenvalue of a vector in the context of transforming matrices?

3425,[ELI5] How can scientists know about the makeup of distant celestial bodies?,"So we have a fairly good understanding of how stars work; we can discern quite a bit about them from their size and color and luminosity.  So now pass a planet in front of that light, and the light will change. Not only will it dim, because it's partially obscured, but the spectral lines will change. From how they change, we can deduce the chemistry of the object that passed in front of it. We can, for example, tell that the object is gaseous, or has an atmosphere, or is rocky, and some of its basic chemical makeup. We can deduce more from other clues, like the period of the orbit, so it's orbital distance, its gravity, other things.  A lot of the conclusions, like it rains diamonds, come from deduction.

3428,Eli5 Why do you have to wait 3 weeks between Pfizer shots?,It is not unusual for vaccines to require multiple stabs for full efficiency. After the first injection you get a strong response from the immune system that will be able to get rid of the vaccine. But you only get a partial respons from the memory cells that is responsible for helping the immune system recognizing future infections. So another injection as the first immune response have died down can help increase the number of memory cells.

Most of the vaccines we administer have had a lot of testing to figure out how they are most efficient while they wait for the paperwork to complete.
