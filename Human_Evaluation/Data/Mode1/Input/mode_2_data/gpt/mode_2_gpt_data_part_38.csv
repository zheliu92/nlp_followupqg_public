3372,"ELI5: What exactly is alcohol, and why does it kill basically everything?",Alcohol is a family of chemicals determined by having and alcohol group attached (R-OH) these kill organisms a few different ways. The most obvious is that in high concentrations it will pull water out of cells in the same way salt does. This isn’t the most significant however. Because the oxygen has two lone pairs on it these lone pairs can attack organic molecules in the organism/virus disrupting metabolic processes or outright destroying cell components. Further depending on the alcohol it can just dissolve cell parts. Recognize not all alcohols are equal. For example humans can consume a shocking amount of ethanol and be okay but even half as much isopropanol will kill you twice over.,So when I have too much to drink it's a big R-OH R-OH?,Related,What is the significance of the hydroxyl group in the structure of alcohol?

3373,"ELI5: What exactly is alcohol, and why does it kill basically everything?","Cell membranes are made from molecules called lipids. These are basically fat molecules that are ordered in a specific way. When these come into contact with alcohol, the alcohol is able to, basically, dissolve the membrane because of how the alcohol and lipids interact. This causes the contents of the cell to leak into the environment, killing the cell. On top of that, the alcohol can also cause proteins to warp in ways that either render them useless or even harmful to the cell.  When it comes to disinfectants, you will likely often see 70% alcohol being used. This is actually for a number of reasons. On an economic level, it's simply cheaper and easier to make. On a disinfectant level, it is good enough, and can even be more effective at dealing with spores because: Having a significant water content increases evaporation time. This means that the alcohol is kept in contact with a surface for longer.",Why doesn't the alcohol destroy too our epiderma cells phospholipids layer?,Related,What is the significance of water content in the disinfectant properties of alcohol?
