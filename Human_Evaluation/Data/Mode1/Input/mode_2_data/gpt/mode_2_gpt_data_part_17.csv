3160,ELI5: What happens when there's too much honey in a bee hive but there's no one to collect it?,"They call this condition ""honeybound""  Queens need open cells to lay eggs... If a colony becomes too cramped in their hive they will create a new set of queens and all the oldest bees and the old queen fly away to start a new hive in some other new space.. the young bees remain behind taking care of the new queens and new baby bees... the new queens have fatal duels until only one remains... typically if the first queen to emerge is healthy she will be allowed to go kill the other queens  before they escape their cocoons... if the best queen is slow to emerge workers will protect that area from a lesser but quicker to emerge queen who would certainly eliminate that better competition given the opportunity.  If the space is extremely cramped or the colony exceptionally populous, they may also send a couple more swarms with newly emerged queens rather than having them duel down to one...  Ideally the best new queen takes the original colony... the old queen starts up a new hive elsewhere... if they're especially fortunate 2-3 minor swarms with new queens also begin anew.  Those minor swarms do not have great odds of survival but sometimes nature finds a way.  Update: thanks so much for all the gifts and goofy comments you all made my day = )  I've only been a bee keeper for a single season, but I take that responsibility seriously so I've tried my best to learn as much as I can so I can be a proper steward of my lil beebies.  I wouldn't call myself an expert by any means but I tell myself to learn like I'll live forever and serve like there's no tomorrow. I try to spend at least a little chunk of time learning more about bees everyday! They're fascinating and I'm a biologist so it's really a joy to learn all about them!  I'd like to encourage anyone and everyone who isn't allergic to work with bees and learn about them and help local bee keeper or become one yourself!  They're marvelous creatures and truly altruistic... working with them has been extremely rewarding and fulfilling... the hardest part is waiting for winter to pass.  As for how the bees select their favored queen? I guess that's one of their secrets, I only know about it because I've seen the way some workers guard their favorite unopened queen cell. I could scratch up a few paragraphs of ideas about factors that go into it but I'm already rambling hahaha... likely there is a lot to it.
