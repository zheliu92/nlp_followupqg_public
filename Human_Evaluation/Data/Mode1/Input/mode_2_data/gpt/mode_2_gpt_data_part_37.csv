3361,ELI5: Is fungi in the air everywhere? How does mold just on appear out of nowhere on something that sits in your house if there's moisture? How does mold and fungi work?,"Mold spores are ubiquitous - they are pretty much everywhere.  Normal indoor spore count ranges from 500 to 5,000 spores per cubic meter, and outdoor spore counts can be as much as 50,000 spores per cubic meter in summer and fall in many areas.  Moldy buildings can have much higher spore counts, sometimes as high as 500,000 spores per cubic meter.  Since they're nearly everywhere, all it takes is the right environment for spores to sprout and become mold - just some water and organic material (like paper or wood or drywall).",Drywall is considered organic?

How does mold and fungi work?,"There are bilions upon bilions of spores in the air everywhere.

3364,[ELI5] Why was ground effect pretty much banned in F1?,"It was deemed too dangerous. Ground effects give very strong downforce when they work ie there is little clearance and a good ""seal"".

What you're missing is that I and V in that equation can't vary independently if the circuit itself is fixed. Since V = IR, and R is fixed, reducing the current necessarily means reducing the voltage. If you, say, halve the current, then you also halve the voltage, which means your new power loss is (1/2 \* original current)(1/2 \* original voltage) = 1/4 the original power loss, just as the formula I^(2)R would suggest.  Or, if you prefer to not fix resistance, changing the resistance changes (because of V = IR) at least one of I or V as well.","Another thing that popped up, how is the electrical power formula VI if the energy lost is also VI?  There's no way all the electrical power is lost through heat right?",Related,Why is it important to maintain current balance in a power plant?

Being on the same plane is the only way not to collide","That doesn’t seem right to me. If you rotated the Earth’s orbit it would never intersect Jupiter’s, right?",Related,What is the significance of the Earth-Sun system's elliptical orbit in maintaining stable orbits?
