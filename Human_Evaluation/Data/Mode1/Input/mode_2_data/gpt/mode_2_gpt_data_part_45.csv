3440,Eli5: why is it so easy to make heat but so hard to make cold?,"The comments are mostly right, but I wanted to try to simplify it even more. The question is, what is heat? The easiest way to think about heat is if we're talking about a gas made up of a bunch of atoms. Temperature in this system is a measure of how much those atoms jiggle. If they're jiggling a lot, then they're very hot. If they're not jiggling much, then it's cold. If you touch a hot gas, the atoms in the gas hit your hand very quickly and cause the atoms in your hand to jiggle from all the impacts. If you light a match, the energy from the match causes the atoms to jiggle even more meaning it's heating up more. If you throw a ball in the gas, every atom it hits gains energy, and then hits a bunch of other atoms causing the entire gas to gain jiggling while slowing down the ball (air friction).  Now how do you remove the jiggling from the gas? There is a concept in physics called entropy. Smashing an egg on the ground is very easy to do. Putting the egg back together again takes a lot of time and effort. Similarly, getting a billion gas molecules to jiggle is easy. Getting them all to stop jiggling is very hard and takes effort.

Then you will audit the work that is left, to see if there is work going on for which there is no process (sometimes called orphan work).   All your observations will be written up in an audit report, which the assessors will use (with audit reports from all the company's other departments) to determine where the company meets the standards and where it does not.

In your audit, you will get a list of processes that the company says describe what the ""shipping"" department does.  You will seek out examples of each process.  Then you will examine the records for all the instances of work that uses the process to see if any instances didn't follow the process (perhaps by following a different process).  Then you will audit the work that is left, to see if there is work going on for which there is no process (sometimes called orphan work).   All your observations will be written up in an audit report, which the assessors will use (with audit reports from all the company's other departments) to determine where the company meets the standards and where it does not.  The assessment team will explain how they want this done/documented.","From (outdated) memory - pretty much this. And my understanding is that (perversely) it's not part of the audit to say how good or otherwise the process is - it's ultimately their business, not yours. Simply, can they demonstrate that they follow their processes?  It's one reason why, when the shoe's on the other foot, you should never be unnecessarily *over*-specific in laying out your processes. The more detailed they are, the more things that you can fail to do (or be unable to demonstrate).",Related,Why is it important to document work in accordance with ISO 9001 standards?
3448,ELI5: We need protein for building muscles. We get calories from protein. Is the protein not burned to produce the calories or does the burning leave the amino acids we need intact?,"We can have just carbohydrates to burn for energy, and in a healthy body, carbohydrates are burned first. Brain and other nerve cells can only process glucose; if you don’t ingest it; your liver has to break down muscle tissues to extract glycogen and supply glucose to the brain.   Fats are both used as energy store and as building blocks; most cell membranes are based on triglycerides and many metabolic processes require fats as solvents for other things.   Protein does not need to be burned for energy; proteins are used as energy source only if there are no others; among other things because cells can’t process them as easily as carbohydrate, because there’s some nasty nitrogen residue left overs etc. Normally proteins get broken down in amino acids and cellular mechanisms use these to repair and build cells, build enzymes, build transport molecules for key chemical reactions etc.","Glycogen is extracted & used without sacrificing muscle tissue. Besides, how would the liver reach muscles to break them down?",Related,What are some examples of cellular processes that rely on protein for repair and maintenance?
