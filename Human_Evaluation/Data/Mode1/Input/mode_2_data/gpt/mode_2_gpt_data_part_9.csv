3089,ELI5: How do Sun Lamps simulate actual sunlight?,"It's about what kinds of wavelengths of light it produces and in what amount. Some lights peak in bluer/violeter(is that a word?) wavelengths. Some peak in the reds and oranges and produce a ""warmer"" light.  Sunlight peaks around Green wavelengths but has a pretty good spread of other colors. It also contains a lot of UV-A and UV-B(Ultra-Violets), which many animal species like reptiles and birds need to be healthy. So when you see these sun lamps, they're often advertised as producing UV light so pet owners know it's what they want. Light bulbs we buy for our homes or offices are only worried about the visible wavelengths and wouldn't be healthy for these animals because they're missing the UV.","Thank you!  So - if I'm understanding this correctly - UV-A and UV-B are what tans skin, enables plants to conduct photosynthesis, etc, and they're \*just wavelengths of light\*?  Swear to goodness, I honestly thought they were.. I don't know, a light-transmitted chemical or something.",Slightly Related,How does the design of sun lamps influence the intensity and color of light?
