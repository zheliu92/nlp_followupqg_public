3265,ELI5 Why do we get dehydrated while flying?,"It's dry air sucked in from the outside, which is very cold, and very dry (-40 <1% humidity), and when you heat cold dry air, you get warm even dryer air. Depending on the age of the aircraft it is either engine bleed air, or outside air pulled in and compressed, or a mix of the two. Both are very dry. The humidity from people breathing helps moisten the air up and it's more comfortable if the air is recirculated in the cabin as it keeps the air a little more humid.   It's also much lower pressure (Usually equivalent of 6000 to 7000 feet) at cruising altitude inside of the aircraft. Lower pressure reduces the boiling point of water and increases the rate it evaporates. The lower the air pressure, the lower the vapor pressure and the more easily water boils and evaporates. This is why food often has high altitude instructions that require you to cook it longer because the food doesn't get as hot because the boiling point is lower. Water can never get hotter than the boiling point so lower boiling point, lower temp, longer cook.   Really though most of what happens is not dehydration, it's just drying of the mouth, sinuses, and throat, which prompts the body to feel thirsty.","Interesting, is there a way for the body to get used to the dry air and “adapt” according?
