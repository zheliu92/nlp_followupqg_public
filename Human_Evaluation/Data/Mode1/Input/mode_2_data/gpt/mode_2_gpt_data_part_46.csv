3451,ELI5: How do aerospace engineers perform quality assurance for rockets?,"They test samples  Almost all liquid fueled engines are test fired on a test stand before being integrated into the big rocket. This way you know that all the plumbing and pumps in the engine are good to go.  The tank needs to be pressure tested, generally this would be done on early samples to confirm what the simulations said. This would be an early design validation bit for the most part and not redone on every new tank once you've confirmed it works.  They also have the ability to abort right at the beginning if something is wrong.  The liquid fueled engines of the rocket generally start 1-3 seconds before launch and the rocket is held down by big clamps. If any of the engines don't seem quite right (not enough thrust, too much thrust, too hot, etc) then they'll cut the engines and abort the launch. There's no way to abort a solid rocket motor so once those boosters start up its going and there's nothing you can do.  On the upside, solid rocket motors are dumb simple so a reliable manufacturing process pretty well avoids issues for them which is why the military uses them so often as they can sit around for years and then just GO with minimal prep work",What is a solid rocket motor?,Slightly Related,What role do simulation and simulation play in the quality assurance of rocket components?

3452,ELI5: How does Climeworks carbon capture technology work? Is the company legit?,"It depends on what you mean by ""work"".  The selective membrane approach for separating a gas from the atmosphere definitely works.  That's how oxygen concentrators work to help people with breathing issues without tanks of oxygen.  The Orca plant will be able to remove 3000-4000 tons per year.  That's 250 Americans worth of CO2.  It's not nothing, but it's not much.  It's only environmental because it has a renewable power source, power it by most electric sources and its a net polluter.  It's expensive, and that's also a problem.  However, the biggest problem is that it leaves you with CO2 gas.  What are you going to do with that?  They have this notion of storing it underground and hoping it never, ever leaks out.  Given the pollution caused by leaking oil/gas wells, this is just not a solution.","I've heard of it [co2] being re-sold commercially to restaurants and things like that?

They're not really going to be looking hard to find someone who has been trespasses before. But when they do it allows them to actually charge them with something and have actual legal consequences. Otherwise the business would have very little to no consequences they could threaten you with.","So is it more like a way to stack charges? Like they catch a shoplifter or something, don’t charge them because it wasn’t expensive so not a felony, and ban them. And then if they catch that person shoplifting again they can hit them w shoplifting + trespass charges?  I just can’t wrap my head around a bunch of employees on the lookout for (probably) a long list of banned customers, especially with employee turnover. I was thinking it was more important for if the person gets caught again",Related,In what ways do automated systems help stores enforce compliance with verbal bans?
3458,ELI5: How would the real estate market work in a sellers market if eventually a majority of buyers can’t afford the homes available? Would that make the market crash?,"The market wouldn't crash... it would become a buyers' market, not a sellers' market, if there were more people trying to sell than buyers willing and able to do so.  Prices would hit a peak and stop climbing or would start falling until the prices matched what buyers can afford. But it wouldn't be a crash where homes prices plummet like 50%. It would be that homes sell at list instead of bidding wars over list. Then maybe they start selling a little below list. Or sellers drop their price a few thousand dollars. Home may sit a little longer and take the typical few weeks/months to sell instead of being under contract within hours/days.",So the current valuations would still remain mostly the same but there be some added discounts to incentivize buyers? And that would transition the market to a buyers market?,Related,What are some potential consequences for a seller's market if a majority of buyers can't afford the homes available?

3459,"Eli5: If white surfaces reflect the most light, why are mirror backings silver?","Because white surfaces don't just reflect light, but also scatter it. Light hitting them isn't going to reflect back at the same angle it came in from because on a microscopic level such surfaces are extremely bumpy. Mirrored surfaces, on the other hand, are made microscopically flat through any number of means, so all the light going in reflects out in the same direction.",Thanks for the reply!
