3400,ELi5: How do touchscreens know when we touch them?,"There are many types of touch screens, but the one you are probably most familiar with is Surface Capacitive Touch Screens.  They react when you touch because the human body has some capacity for static electricity. When you touch the screen, some of the electricity will flow between the body and the screen allowing the controller(or whatever on-board computer) to pinpoint where you touched it.     *edit: I googled for some examples, but here is a site that clearly shows some examples of this and other types of touch screens if you want to know more.*   [https://tru-vumonitors.com/touch-screen-basics/](https://tru-vumonitors.com/touch-screen-basics/)","Okay, that makes sense, but what about styluses?",Strongly Related,What are capacitive touch sensors and how do they work?

3404,ELI5: How do we know the universe is constantly expanding?,"Have you ever heard a train horn or siren get higher-pitched as it approached then lower-pitched as it went by? Well, that's the Doppler effect.

This is called redshift. When we look out into space, pretty much everything is redshifting.

3406,ELI5: What does it mean when people say that a country is in debt?,"If the US refused to pay back the money it owes then it would lower the US's credit rating.  This would mean that the US would have to borrow money at a higher interest rate (countries generally borrow money by issuing bonds and asking people, countries, organisations, etc to buy them with the promise of routine interest payments and then at a set date paying the bond off).  This could mean that people, organisations and countries would be cautious of lending the US money as the US has shown that it doesn't pay it back.  However, higher interest rates would mean that the US would have to pay more money back and that might entice some to lend.    Having debt in itself isn't bad for a country.  Debt gives you more money to spend.  The issue is a country refuses to pay it back or doesn't have the ability to pay it back (in a case where the interest they owe is more than they can afford to pay).","I see how it parallels personal financial debt, but I just can’t seem to wrap my head around what real consequences the United States would have to deal with if they were just like “nope, not gonna do it.” It’s trillions of dollars.

Voltage pushes the electrons through the wire. If you run a direct wire between the live and ground prongs of your outlet, there is little to impede their flow and you get a flood of electrons - breakers in your house shut off power when this happens.  Devices limit their current draw in different ways. Basic resistive components have a resistance - they are highly imperfect conductors and so electrons encounter a lot of resistance as they try to move. This hinders the flow. One of the most basic equations you'll find in electronics is V=IR, which describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.  Other devices may use inductive or capacitive limits - AC power is constantly trying to change, and these components can limit it by either requiring or resisting change - unlike a resistor these do not turn energy into heat and so are more efficient.  More modern supplies switch on and off. By switching on and off faster or slower, we can limit how much power flows through without bulky capacitors or inductors and without the waste of resistors.
