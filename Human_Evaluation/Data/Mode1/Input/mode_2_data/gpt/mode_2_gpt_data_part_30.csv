3291,ELI5: Where did oxygen come from?,"First, oxygen doesn't burn. Burning is an oxidation reaction where oxygen bonds to some fuel in an exothermic (heat-releasing) reaction. Gaseous oxygen does tend to stick to other oxygen to form O2 but that isn't really considered burning.  But even when oxygen bonds to a fuel it is still oxygen. The atom of oxygen still exists, it is just in a molecule of the products of the burning reaction. Burning don’t just obliterate stuff.",Interesting.

3296,ELI5: What is human flatulence?,"Not a gastroenterologist, but let's examine the premise and start with some facts in the hopes of getting some serious answers. I think the point of your question lies in fart-transmission being different from fecal transmission. We know well that we can get sick from bacteria/viruses going from poop to another persons mouth and infecting them that way. You're suggesting an airborne transmission of an intestinal illness (I think).  1. The average amount of gas a human produces in a day is roughly 1L (per Google) 2. The average amount of air exhaled in a day is roughly 11,000L.  So from this we know that if a microorganism had to choose spreading via farting which is to say by airborne transmission, that's 11,000 times *less efficient* than just going straight through the lungs. We also know that microorganisms generally infect/attack the place they are released from, so an intestinal infection prefers to attack the intestine which means it needs to be eaten, not inhaled. *It is possible* to get intestinal infections in your lungs and lung infections in your intestines in certain cases but this isn't common, it's not the preferred method of transmission.  We can also assume that most farts are filtered through underwear and pants, which is similar to wearing a face mask, it'll filter out many of the particulates that microorganisms ride on. So let's assume transmission from fart, through clothes, into the lungs is yet further unlikely.  In the end, this doesn't pass the sniff test (...ha), it's just too circuitous to be an intentional transmission route. Much easier for the illness to spread via direct fecal contamination, in fact that's really, really easy.  However, a quick google search gives an affirmative ""Not Completely Impossible"" as there are demonstrated cases of Cholera (an intestinal illness) infecting the lungs of people with immune disorders. In this case, it's most likely a case of dirty-surface fecal contamination being introduced to the lungs via touching the nose/mouth and *inhaling the feces* but still, it's credible.  So ""Not Fully Impossible"" but extremely unlikely unless you have extremely poor hygiene habits and are immunocompromised.","> In the end, this doesn't pass the sniff test (...ha), it's just too circuitous to be an intentional transmission route.

Outside of some sort of serious sickness, where flatulence possibly leads to feces (sorry for gross visual), the two are basically in separate bacterial categories as far as I understand (please correct me if I'm wrong).  I know from reading random Reddit threads that many, many people like to sleep in their beds without any clothes.

3299,ELI5: Why are bank transactions closed during weekends. Isn't onlinebanking only computers?,"Because banks are required to balance their books at the end of each day, and transfers in and out change the overall balances of the institution, but they do not want to pay people to work every day to make these decisions. For example, a bank may be required to keep 3% of its deposits in a liquid asset, and a transfer out may drop them below this limit. By holding Transactions until the next business day, they will have employees on staff able to insure compliance with the requirements.",Why isn't this automated?,Slightly Related,What are some regulatory requirements that banks must meet during the weekend?
