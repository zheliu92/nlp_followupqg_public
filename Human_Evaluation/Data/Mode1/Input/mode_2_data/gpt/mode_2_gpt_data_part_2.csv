3010,"Eli5 how headphones with 40mm drivers reproduce low bass notes convincingly, but it takes a very large loudspeaker driver to reproduce bass notes?","A small driver can reproduce low frequencies/long wavelengths as long as your ear is less than one wavelength (or half a wavelength?) from the driver.  Beyond that, you need large drivers. I'm not sure what the rule is that relates the diameter of the driver to the length of the wavelength it can send. For reference, 1 meter is the wavelength of 343 Hz","So, a larger driver can project a lower frequency further at the same volume?",Related,What role does the size of the cone play in the sound produced by 40mm drivers?

3012,ELI5: Why are planes not getting faster?,"As a sidebar to the main answer, it may seem like passenger aircraft haven’t changed much in 60 years: same basic shape, similar speed.  But there’s one huge advance that isn’t obvious: fuel efficiency.  Today’s aircraft are **10 times more fuel efficient** than they were in the 1950s, in terms of fuel used per passenger per km.  This has been achieved through bigger planes with more seats, but mostly through phenomenal improvements in engine technology.

3013,ELI5: Why are planes not getting faster?,The short version is nobody cares about going faster.  Jet engines and planes have improved tremendously in efficiency.  In the last 60 years the average fuel burn dropped over 45%.which is an insane improvement.   And less fuel is cheaper flights and more profit.,"And perhaps the biggest cause of that fuel burn decrease is the switch from turbojet engines to turbofans. A modern turbofan has very much in common with a turboprop, in that 90% of the thrust is generated by the fan in the front of the engine (pretty much a propeller with 20-30(?) blades). This is what makes modern jet engines so wide in comparison to their slender cousins from the 60s",Related,How do economies of scale impact the efficiency of jet engines?

3014,ELI5: Why are planes not getting faster?,Another point is that the benefit for increased speed is marginal when typical flights aren’t all that long to begin with and when a good portion of the time of the flight is due to air traffic control issues and on-the-ground taxiing at the airport. I remember my dad (who worked for a major airline) commenting about how flights to Southern California took 45 minutes longer than when he started even though the planes were faster — all due to traffic and airport issues.,Arrive 2+ hours before your one-hour flight to allow time for security checks... ok. Allow 1+ hours for that layover in a major metro in case the first leg runs late. So who cares if a new plane could save six minutes in the air? There is 100x more time to be saved on airports and aircraft that are apparently just too dense for the public to use safely or for operators to put on direct routes even once a day. And those are just the 20-year-old problems... unmitigated carbon emissions and airborne disease transmission are something else entirely.,Slightly Related,What are some examples of delays caused by on-the-ground operations that could be addressed by faster planes?
