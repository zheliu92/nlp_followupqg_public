3141,ELI5: How are allergies related to the immune system?,"Your digestive tract is essentially a tube going through your body. It's where elements from outside of your body have an opportunity to go inside your body. A strong digestive tract prevents this.  Between the cells that line your intestines, you have something called tight-junction. When your tight-junction become damaged, they allow gaps to form between the cells of your intestines.  Then, bacteria and molecules from foods that you eat can enter into your bloodstream, which will cause a heightened immune-state.  Your immune system starts attacking a lot more things because it's always on high alert because of potential toxins floating around in your bloodstream.   I used to have bad pollen allergies. Watery eyes and constant sneezing. It last for a few years. Then one year I started intermittent and long-term fasting. I stopped having allergies that year.  Then I switched to a keto diet, and remain unaffected by pollen. But if I start eating a lot of junk food and crap during allergy season, my eyes start itching again .  Certain foods damage the tight junction in your digestive tract. You can test the permeability of your intestines with the PEG400 test. You drink a solution, and then find out how many particles from that solution end up in your pee. It's supposed to be 0, but if it's above 0 then it means the particles have crossed into your bloodstream, and then were filtered through your kidneys.",She was telling me about diet and I think about this too!! Saying stuff about leaky gut... I thought it sounded suspicious though but ultimately you have had good results?!,Strongly Related,What are some examples of systemic allergies?
