3281,ELI5: Why is it impossible to suck through a straw that's 10.4 meters long?,"The action of sucking does not actually pull on water. Rather, it allows the air on the other end to push by removing the air from the end inside of your mouth.  This means that, since there is only 1 atm of air, you're limited to that much pushing.  As water climbs the tube, gravity pulls it down, generating a pressure to counteract the pushing. This pressure depends solely on the density of water and the height at the top of the water.  So, solving for the density of water, we see that water can only get 10.4 meters above its surface from the action of atmospheric pressure. If the straw goes deeper than the water's surface, then the straw itself can be longer, but the water can only be raised above its surface by that amount.  The formula for hydrostatic pressure is quite straightforward. p = ρ g h  This is the pressure generated by gravity acting on the water, and it is the pressure that counteracts the pressure of air pushing up. Interestingly, the pressure of the air itself can be found using the same formula (although to get an accurate answer you have to modify it with calculus to account for gravity and changes in density).","but what if the straw was thinner, that way as the water goes up, there is less pressure pulling it downwards therefore allows for it to go higher. and would in theory having one end of the straw be at the bottom of the mariana trench, allow the water to be sucked further past the ocean surface as there is more pressure pushing the water up due to the immense amount of water in the ocean?",Strongly Related,What is the role of the air pressure in the ability to suck through a straw that's longer than 10.4 meters?

3282,ELI5: Is the inversion of entropy as depicted in Tenet (2020) scientifically accurate?,"No, it isn't.

As you can see on the telescope photos, if you zoom in between the stars, you can see distant shining galaxies. If the visible universe was infinite, they'd fill the gaps completely and the space would be uniformly bright. The limited size of the visible universe and the finite speed of light are what makes the space black: thanks to them there are directions where there isn't a star.  There's also background radiation from the Big Bang, but it's invisible to the human eye.",So is the black color basically a proof that the universe is expanding? (When you say limited size of the visible universe),Slightly Related,Why is it important to observe distant galaxies with telescopes?

3289,ELI5: Why is the speed of sound constant?,"The speed of sound is not constant. It depends on the temperature of the medium (and indeed what the medium is made of). It's mathematical formula is square root (specific heat ratio * Gas constant * temperature).  Loudness is a measure of intensity not speed. Being louder doesn't mean you're heard quicker, it means you're heard more prominently.","Hmm, so when someone says ""X is faster than the speed of sound"", are they generally talking about the speed of sound in room temperature air or the max speed of sound in air?",Slightly Related,What is the specific heat ratio and how does it relate to the speed of sound?
