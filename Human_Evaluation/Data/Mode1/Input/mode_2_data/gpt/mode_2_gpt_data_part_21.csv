3200,ELI5: Why do gas prices include the extra 9/10 cent on the end?,"Maybe urban legend but I thought it was to decrease theft by the cashier.  It increases the chances of having the end price to be a multiple of a dollar ($xx.00) and always have some cents.  This meant the cashier would have to open the till to make change, which got logged instead of pocketing the bills","That's fascinating! I assume you pour first, pay later? Where I live, you gotta pay first or it won't dispense, so I can just say ""give me $40 for pump 9"" and then pour exactly $40 of gas, no change, tax included.",Related,How does the addition of a 9/10 cent at the pump affect the consumer's perception of gas prices?

3201,"ELI5: Can pouring hot water on windshield or window ice to melt it really crack the glass? or is it so rare that one shouldn't worry about it? and if so, how does it happen?",When the glass heats up it expands. If it’s cold then pouring hot water on it will expand one side before the other and that causes stress inside the glass which might make it crack. Another big reason you shouldn’t try this is because if it’s really cold the boiling water could just freeze on the window or down the side of your car,"Follow-up question - it sounds like the level of risk depends on how cold it is outside and how hot the water is. If I've safely done this at a certain outside temp (let's say 25° F) with hot (not boiling) water, was I just lucky or can I assume that I'm safe at those 2 levels of those variables?",Strongly Related,What are the typical properties of glass that allow it to absorb hot water?
