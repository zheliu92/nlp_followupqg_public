3341,ELI5 What makes Inductors and Capacitors important for radio?,"Capacitors have high impedance at low frequencies, and low impedance at high frequencies. Inductors are the opposite. Low impedance at low frequencies, and high impedance at high frequencies. And impedance basically means frequency dependent resistance. So, one thing you can do is use a capacitor to drive high frequencies into the ground, and inductor to do the same for low frequencies. Boom, that's a band-pass filter. That's pretty useful for radio applications, since you probably don't want to be listening all the frequencies at the same time.  Now for radios, a tuning capacitor is certainly used to control the internal mixing frequency, but that works just the same for incoming and outgoing signals. I'm not se sure if a variable inductor for transmitting was ever a thing.","Thank you, that's a great explanation, so inductors for transmitting are fixed?",Related,What role do capacitors play in the internal mixing frequency of radio signals?

If you move the magnet back and forth very quickly at 256 Hz (256 back-and-forths per second) the person on the other end hears a pure C note. Just one note.  Your voice is a complex superposition of a shitton of different pure fundamental frequencies. In other words, your voice is multiple pure notes played at the same time. When you say ""hey dude,"" your vocal cords are producing many individual pure notes that add up to form a much more complex sound. *All* sounds can be broken up into constituent pure notes. This is the concept of the Fourier transform, but you don't need to worry about that.  How do all those notes fit into the phone line at the same time? Well, they just sorta... do. Electrons are *tiny.* Go look up the size of an electron — yeah, they're really freaking small. Tons of them can fit on a very small wire at the same time. So, each of the sound waves that add up to your voice are simply carried along the wire simultaneously. Imagine if cars were like ghosts, and they could just pass through each other while driving to their destination. That's what electrons are like. It isn't really this simple in reality because of quantum physics, and I'm not qualified to explain that, but for 99% of cases, it just works like that.  And all those constituent waves travel the exact same way as the single pure note dud. The only reason the clarity goes down at all is because some of the electrons bump into shit. As technology gets better, we find ways to keep the electrons from bumping into shit, and we improve the clarity of our phones.

Seriously, it's just magnets.  When your voice hits the microphone on your phone, it vibrates a magnet back and forth, and the vibrating magnet ripples the electrons in the phone line.  When the ripples (which travel almost at the speed of light) reach the person on the other end, they go into another magnet. When a magnet connected to wires is vibrated, it ripples the electrons — and when the rippling electrons touch the magnet on the other side, it vibrates the magnet! It's literally the inverse of how it went in. Yeah, that's right, a speaker is fundamentally *the same exact thing* as a microphone, just built differently to better suit the task.  So, when the magnet in the speaker on your friend's phone vibrates, it moves the air around it, because all moving objects contain momentum that transfers to the molecules around it.
