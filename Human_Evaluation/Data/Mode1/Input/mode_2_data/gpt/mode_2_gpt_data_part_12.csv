3113,ELI5: why is it possible to see something break through the sound barrier?,"What you're seeing is called a vapor cone, and it is *not* inherently related to supersonic flight.  All that's happening is that you have shock waves and expansion fans caused by the hard surfaces of the aircraft as it moves through the air; the shockwaves compress the air (causing the water in the air to condense into a visible cloud), and then the expansion fan rapidly returns the compressed air to ambient(ish) conditions (causing the water to evaporate again).  It's generally a sign of a plane entering the *transonic* regime (e.g. Ma 0.7 to 0.9), but while it's an indication that a plane is certainly traveling fast, it's not necessarily evidence that they've actually hit Ma 1.0 or higher.",How often do you get a vapor cone pop into existence without the inevitable sonic boom that follows?
