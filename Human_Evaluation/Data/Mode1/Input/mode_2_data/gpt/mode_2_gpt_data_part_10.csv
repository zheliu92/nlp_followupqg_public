3091,"ELI5: If Carbon Capture is Possible but impractical due to the storage once it is accomplished, what prevents us from storing sequestration products it in previously tapped oil reservoirs?","Consider - if you could efficiently capture carbon out of the air into a usable fuel source, why would engines spew it out as waste through the tailpipe instead of capturing and pumping it back into the gas tank? The answer is that the energy required to do this is greater than the energy you get out of it, so you'd burn more gas than you get. Which could be fine if you are using a green energy to perform this process, but at that point it's not particularly productive since you're using more energy than you're capturing. Especially since at that point, synthetic fuels are more efficient.",So basically a future reality with tons of carbon capture and still burning fossil fuels is a ridiculous oil industry myth/fraud because there is no possible way we’d use the huge amount of green energy sources required to offset continuing to burn fossil fuels instead of just replacing fossil fuels?
