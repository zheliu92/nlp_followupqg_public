3001,ELI5 What is GERD?,"Gerd (GastroEsophageal Reflux Disease) is a problem with the sphincter that leads into the stomach. If the sphincter doesn't close properly, stomach acids can be pumped back up the esophagus. The acid is an irritant, the mucus is what the delicate tissues use to defend themselves.  Reflux is a common cause of heartburn. Constant reflux can cause cancer of the sphincter.",I c this was the answer I was looking for. I might have sleep apnea because of this. May I ask how are we breathing if the mucus blocks the airway at night?,Related,What are the symptoms of GERD?

3003,ELI5: How does our voice turn into code / get reciprocated while phoning?,"In a nutshell:  The sound waves from your voice are received by a microphone.  The microphone vibrates from the sound waves, and transforms the vibrations into an electrical signal.  The electrical signal is transmitted to a speaker.  The speaker transforms the electrical signal into a vibration.  The vibration creates sound waves that your ears can interpret.","Hey, I totally respect and appreciate this. But really what I wanted to know is how does the microphone have this feature to vibrate from the sound wave, to transform it to a signal and then send it. How did this come about ? It’s so intensely fine",Related,What are the benefits of using a combination of voice waves and electrical signals in phone conversations?

3008,ELI5: How does the heart compensate when loosing a lot of blood? For example a head injury or a something more severe?,It beats faster to push what blood you do have to where your body still needs it.  For serious injury this can basically kill you because you eventually don't have enough blood to keep the heart or brain Alive. This is why you put pressure on a wound or you tourniquet the area so that blood just can't flow to that extremity.  Less severe injuries it means the heart compensates by going faster. It also means platelets are going to clot and block where you are bleeding to eventually stabilize.,Doesn't it also regulate pressure by constricting blood vessels to keep the flow at the same pressure?,Related,What is the role of platelets in clotting blood?
