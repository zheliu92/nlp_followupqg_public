Wouldn't plutonium constantly be emitting radiation regardless?,"It is constantly radiating, yes. But the two spheres act like mirrors that focus it back into the core, exciting more fission.  Keeping the spheres separated with a screwdriver just a little bit allows a small amount of that radiation to leak out instead of getting reflected back in. Just enough to keep the core *juuuuuust* below its ""you fucked up"" point.  You could probably think of the demon core like a big steam boiler building up lots of pressure, and the screwdriver holding the hemispheres apart like holding a bleed valve open slightly. You're trying to keep that thing at a very specific pressure close to the boiler's breaking point, because you're trying to measure how the boiler behaves when it's really close to failure. But if you slip and lose grip on the bleed valve, pressure will build up almost instantly and the boiler will explode, killing you.  The demon core wouldn't actually explode like the nuclear bombs you think of, though. It would mostly just flash very hot very briefly.

3113,ELI5: why is it possible to see something break through the sound barrier?,"What you're seeing is called a vapor cone, and it is *not* inherently related to supersonic flight.  All that's happening is that you have shock waves and expansion fans caused by the hard surfaces of the aircraft as it moves through the air; the shockwaves compress the air (causing the water in the air to condense into a visible cloud), and then the expansion fan rapidly returns the compressed air to ambient(ish) conditions (causing the water to evaporate again).  It's generally a sign of a plane entering the *transonic* regime (e.g. Ma 0.7 to 0.9), but while it's an indication that a plane is certainly traveling fast, it's not necessarily evidence that they've actually hit Ma 1.0 or higher.",How often do you get a vapor cone pop into existence without the inevitable sonic boom that follows?
