3240,ELI5: Why can't we just make water by smooshing hydrogen and oxygen atoms together?,"We CAN.  Now, it's not very often in nature you come across pure hydrogen and pure oxygen.  But if you do have pure hydrogen and pure oxygen and you put them together in the right ratio, it's very easy to get them to form water.  In fact, it's hard to PREVENT them from forming water.  It's a common 9th grade science experiment, you run electricity through water in a certain way and one electrode has bubbles of pure oxygen forming on it and the other pure hydrogen.  You catch each in their own test-tube. You combine the two.   A very small spark will cause them to smoosh together and form water.  Thing is, sometimes you don't even need a spark, sometimes just the right (or wrong) type of shaking will do the trick.  Now, in the process of forming water a lot of heat is generated, which has the potential to be very damaging.  Also, pure oxygen tends to burn super easy so there's not a lot of pure oxygen around.  And pure hydrogen tends to react with stuff a lot too.  So you don't bump into pure forms of them very often in nature.  And making pure forms of them is relatively difficult and expensive.  **DUE TO REQUESTS - VIDEOS**  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38ULHoKWZag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38ULHoKWZag) \- an animation of what is going on  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8gE4oZ9FQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8gE4oZ9FQ) \- a guy using 2 thumbtacks and a 9 volt battery to do this - but he isn't catching the gas  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV8KbQyF228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV8KbQyF228) \- a guy mixing O and H in front of a flame, it goes POP and they zoom in on the small droplets of water formed on the inside.

3247,ELI5 Why is USA GDP growth so steady in comparison to EU?,"Not an economist, but at a *really* high level, I think it’s a few things:  * The EU is heavily regulated & expensive, and highly fragmented.  It’s a tough place to start new, disruptive businesses - it lags well behind the US in startups / VC funded stuff. * Europe is traditionally a hub in finance (particularly the UK), but Brexit + the center of the world moving towards Asia and away from Europe makes this increasingly less of an advantage & growth area. * Europe excels at traditional high science research (medicine / physics / etc), but it’s waaaay behind in software & IT. This has been a huge driver of US growth recently. * It’s quite reasonable to argue that the US stock market is overvalued / in a bubble fueled by tech and low interest rates and some of said growth is speculative & artificial.","Who do you think will be better off in the long run?

3248,"ELI5 - What is the difference between a state, a county and a country?","A county is a subdivision of local government.  State and country can be used synonymously along with nation for the same thing: a sovereign entity under international law.  State can also be used for a semi-sovereign sub-national division.  Nation can also be used to refer to a traditional cultural / ethnic group.  It’s messy because these terms all come to us from history and really the modern concept of nation states is relatively new, only a few of hundred years old, so the usage of these terms is overlapping.",So this is why United States is not called United Counties - because of the sovereign thing?,Slightly Related,Can a county be used for a semi-sovereign sub-national division?

3249,ELI5: Why has someone came up with cheaper jetfuel ?,"Electric airplanes have long been a great idea and people have tried to make work, but unfortunately, outside of experimental craft, its just not viable yet.  Airplane engines, both prop and jet engines, need a ton of power and a lot of fuel. Electric batteries simply aren't powerful enough compared to fuel at the same weight. You'd have so many batteries that they would weigh too much, fuel on other hand, provide a lot more energy for the weight. An electric plane wouldn't get too far, it would be too heavy. Fuel is a  great compromise as its quite powerful for the weight.  If we ever get batteries down an absolute ton in weight, we might see ideas for some smaller planes to operate on electric power. But the big planes would need even more reductions in battery weight or wild increases in battery efficiency and storage","Couldn't they be used to maintain flight though?
