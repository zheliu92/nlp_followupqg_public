3451,ELI5: How do aerospace engineers perform quality assurance for rockets?,"They test samples  Almost all liquid fueled engines are test fired on a test stand before being integrated into the big rocket. This way you know that all the plumbing and pumps in the engine are good to go.  The tank needs to be pressure tested, generally this would be done on early samples to confirm what the simulations said. This would be an early design validation bit for the most part and not redone on every new tank once you've confirmed it works.  They also have the ability to abort right at the beginning if something is wrong.  The liquid fueled engines of the rocket generally start 1-3 seconds before launch and the rocket is held down by big clamps. If any of the engines don't seem quite right (not enough thrust, too much thrust, too hot, etc) then they'll cut the engines and abort the launch. There's no way to abort a solid rocket motor so once those boosters start up its going and there's nothing you can do.  On the upside, solid rocket motors are dumb simple so a reliable manufacturing process pretty well avoids issues for them which is why the military uses them so often as they can sit around for years and then just GO with minimal prep work",What is a solid rocket motor?,Slightly Related,What role do simulation simulations play in quality assurance for rockets?

3457,ELI5: how do stores enforce verbal bans?,"Mostly it's a question of legal consequences. If you receive a verbal tresspass warning it's the same as seeing a ""no trespassing"" sign and crossing anyways. It means they can then charge you with defiant tresspassing.   They're not really going to be looking hard to find someone who has been trespasses before. But when they do it allows them to actually charge them with something and have actual legal consequences.

3458,ELI5: How would the real estate market work in a sellers market if eventually a majority of buyers can’t afford the homes available? Would that make the market crash?,"The market wouldn't crash... it would become a buyers' market, not a sellers' market, if there were more people trying to sell than buyers willing and able to do so.  Prices would hit a peak and stop climbing or would start falling until the prices matched what buyers can afford. But it wouldn't be a crash where homes prices plummet like 50%. It would be that homes sell at list instead of bidding wars over list. Then maybe they start selling a little below list. Or sellers drop their price a few thousand dollars. Home may sit a little longer and take the typical few weeks/months to sell instead of being under contract within hours/days.",So the current valuations would still remain mostly the same but there be some added discounts to incentivize buyers? And that would transition the market to a buyers market?,Related,How might a shortage of inventory affect the housing market?

3459,"Eli5: If white surfaces reflect the most light, why are mirror backings silver?","Because white surfaces don't just reflect light, but also scatter it. Light hitting them isn't going to reflect back at the same angle it came in from because on a microscopic level such surfaces are extremely bumpy. Mirrored surfaces, on the other hand, are made microscopically flat through any number of means, so all the light going in reflects out in the same direction.",Thanks for the reply!
