3490,eli5: Why did the life expectancy for people with down syndrome increase from 25 years in 1980 to 60 years today?,"During WW2 in Germany and I believe Austria, many kids and babies who were institutionalized for disabilities were killed by being out outside without sufficient clothes so they would get pneumonia and die.   Institutions tend to be mental hospitals or called insane asylums. People there get maintenance care at best.","Why kill by exposure? Wouldn't it be much kinder (Pun originally unintended) to just put a bullet in their head? Obviously not killing them would be kinder than either but since that wasn't an option.  Sure it doesn't have the stigma of killing a child but death from pneumonia is a worse more painful death than from a bullet to the head or being suffocated in their sleep.

3492,Eli5: Who exactly messed up in the Grenfell cladding?,"In engineering risk assessment there is a theory called the cheese model. Imagine many slices of cheese, each with some holes in random positions. Each slice of cheese represents one entity in the engineering project, and holes represent safety holes in that one entity.

Everything is at the wrong place at the same time, and disaster happens.   Truth is, humans *will* make mistakes. It is unavoidable. Any attempts to reduce risk *will* cause risks of its own. The best we can do is to have many layers of cheese (safety mechanism) so that the chance of holes aligning (all safety mechanisms failing) is as small as possible. The desire to blame a single entity for disasters is not only wrong, but also makes the entire system prone to future disasters.

So, my idea was that the lowest-energy state (if that even exists for space-time) is the uncurved state. Conversely, a curved state requires energy to keep it from popping back to it's lowest-energy state.  But, reading the comments, I understand my perception of what space-time is, is wrong. It just has the property that it warps in the presence of mass, like a ball has the property of being spherical, am I right?",Related,Can you explain the concept of a gravitational field and its role in the conservation of mass?
