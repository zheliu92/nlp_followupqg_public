3040,eli5: what is API?,Pretend you own a website that tells the weather. You want me to display it on my website. You can create a way for a user to grab todays temperature. Its real simple and like one line of code for me called grab_todays_temp(). On the inside of this function its way more complex. But I can’t see how it works on the inside and I don’t need to know. All I care about is gettin the temperature from your website.,"in this scenario, do you also have to have an API on your end to receive today's temp? or are you given the API by the website and you simply run it in order to grab today's temp?",Related,What are some common use cases for API functionality in web development?

Registers are typically not shared (since they are implemented internal to an IC). Unless you are poking deep into the HW and chips (eg writing drivers etc), there is rarely any reason to interact with HW registers (and attempts to change register settings without knowing EXACTLY how they will change the function of the hardware is very unproductive)  Go pick up a few data sheets of some simple control ICs and you can see how they explain register settings etc.",Thanks for the response.
