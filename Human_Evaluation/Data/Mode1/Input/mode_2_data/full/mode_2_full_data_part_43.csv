3420,ELI5: What is an Eigenvalue and an Eigenvector?,"In the language of vectors and matrices; A geometric vector is basically something with a length and direction. You can transform vectors by multiplying matrices by them, for example a rotation of 180 degrees in 2D can be represented by the matrix  |\-1|0| |:-|:-| |0|\-1|  If you multiply any vector by this matrix then it will rotate it around 180 degrees.  Now most matrices aren't that simple and they will do a combination of operations, changing the length and direction of vectors in complex ways.For a given matrix an eigenvector is one which doesn't have its direction changed, i.e only its length is scaled when you multiply it by that matrix. The eigenvalue is how much that length is scaled.  For example if we have some matrix M and a vector (3,5). Then say we multiply M\*V and get a new vector (6,10) which = 2\*(3,5). This means V is an eigenvector of M with an eigenvalue of 2, applying M to V has just scaled it by a factor 2 without changing its direction.",Isn't the 180 degree rotation matrix just multiplying by -1? Or do negatives don't count?,Related,What is the significance of an eigenvalue in the context of scalability?

3425,[ELI5] How can scientists know about the makeup of distant celestial bodies?,"So we have a fairly good understanding of how stars work; we can discern quite a bit about them from their size and color and luminosity.

3428,Eli5 Why do you have to wait 3 weeks between Pfizer shots?,It is not unusual for vaccines to require multiple stabs for full efficiency. After the first injection you get a strong response from the immune system that will be able to get rid of the vaccine. But you only get a partial respons from the memory cells that is responsible for helping the immune system recognizing future infections. So another injection as the first immune response have died down can help increase the number of memory cells. As for why there is exactly 3 weeks between the stabs for the BioNTech vaccine is because that was what they used in their stage 3 trial so that is what have been certified. Most of the vaccines we administer have had a lot of testing to figure out how they are most efficient while they wait for the paperwork to complete. But for vaccines like the coronavirus vaccines as well as the seasonal flu we do not have time for this so we just make educated guesses and run trials to make sure this is safe and effective.  There are lots of indications suggesting that the BioNTech vaccine works just fine with just one shot. The trial can be interpreted as low as 65% efficiency after three weeks but some suggest this might be as high as 98% after five weeks with just one stab. And some countries are delaying the second injection in order to make sure as many people as possible have the first injection as soon as possible.,So what would happen if someone double dosed too soon?,Related,Why might some countries delay the second injection in order to ensure as many people as possible have the first injection as soon as possible?
