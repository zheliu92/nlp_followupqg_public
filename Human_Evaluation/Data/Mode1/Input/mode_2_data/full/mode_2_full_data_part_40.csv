3390,"ELI5 Human can max see 3 colors, do we know the exact frequencies?","I think it is misleading you to call them red, green, and blue color receptors.

We call them red, green, and blue because of where the strongest response is, but if someone has only green cones for some reason their eyes still respond perfectly well to pure red light - it'll just look like slightly less vivid light of whatever their perception is of the only color they can see.  When we see a particular color, our brain is doing a relatively complex computation - it looks at how much each cone is activated, and compares this to situational things like what color the illuminating light appears to be in a scene.

3391,ELI5: why do ingrown hairs get infected even if the surface of skin isn't broken?,"In fact they dont. Ingrown hairs simply are seen as forein object and thus needed to be isolated and/or eliminated. This is one of the jobs of our white blood cells.

So, while these mechanisms do appear durning infections, it doesnt mean that when they do there is an actual infection. Simply this time the foreign object instead of being a bacteria is a looong string of chitin (the hair). The white cells continue to attack it trying to remove it and in the end just die around it.

You also learned today that businesses who would have otherwise paid people to work these jobs don’t exist because they can’t compete with literal slave labor.,"The highest paid individual at the girl scouts from a quick google search is between $250,000 and $490,000. Somewhat high for a nonprofit but not when you consider the size of their operation.

3398,Eli5: how can an object catch on fire from moving so fast?,">For example, when rockets enter atmospheres, they catch on fire and have special plates at the bottom to prevent them from completely engulfing in flames. Why does this happen? Does it have to do with the speed or is it something else? Thanks!       When you compress something it will heat up. You might know this from diesel engines - they don't have spark plugs, they ignite their fuel by simply compressing it!      Same thing applies to the air around you. If you compress it hard enough, by - for example - flying large objects through or rather *against* it at preposterous velocities - it will also get very hot.      Contrary to popular belief friction has nothing to do with it.","I thought it was a combination of compressive heating and friction?

3399,ELI5: Why can't humans photosynthesize like plants do? Is this something we could eventually breed ourselves to be able to do?,Humans can't photosynthesize like plants because we don't have chlorophyll or any of the associated structures to make it. This isn't something we are likely to be able to breed into humanity because breeding is really only useful to increase the prevalence of existing traits; if you want taller people you breed the tallest current people together and their offspring are likely to be taller. But you can't breed the people with the most chlorophyll together because nobody has any.  There are some animals that can employ chlorophyll within their cells but they do so by consuming plants and forming a symbiotic relationship with them. Waiting around for humans to spontaneously mutate the ability to biologically produce chlorophyll is extremely unlikely.  Now the other problem is that there is really no good reason to want to do this in the first place. Humans just don't have enough surface area which can be exposed to the sun in order to make chlorophyll worthwhile; our energy requirements are so high that it would be irrelevant. Sunlight just doesn't have the energy density to make human photosynthesis helpful.," Whoa, what animal uses chlorophyll like that?",Related,What are the specific metabolic pathways that humans lack that plants use to photosynthesize?
