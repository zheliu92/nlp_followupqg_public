3200,ELI5: Why do gas prices include the extra 9/10 cent on the end?,"Maybe urban legend but I thought it was to decrease theft by the cashier.  It increases the chances of having the end price to be a multiple of a dollar ($xx.00) and always have some cents.  This meant the cashier would have to open the till to make change, which got logged instead of pocketing the bills","That's fascinating! I assume you pour first, pay later?
