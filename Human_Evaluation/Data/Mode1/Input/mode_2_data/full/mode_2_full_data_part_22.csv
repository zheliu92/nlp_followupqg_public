3210,"ELI5: Why does your brain expect pain, is it a beneficial process?","The short answer is an idea called [predictive coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding). The sights, sounds, bodily feelings, smells, tastes, and thoughts/feelings that we experience as we go about our day are based partly on prediction.

The brain is locked inside a bony skull. All it receives are ambiguous and noisy sensory signals that are only indirectly related to objects in the world. Perception must therefore be a process of inference, in which indeterminate sensory signals are combined with prior expectations or ‘beliefs’ about the way the world is, to form the brain’s optimal hypotheses of the causes of these sensory signals – of coffee cups, computers and clouds. What we see is the brain’s ‘best guess’ of what’s out there. \[...\] In this view, which is often called ‘predictive coding’ or ‘predictive processing’, perception is a controlled hallucination, in which the brain’s hypotheses are continually reined in by sensory signals arriving from the world and the body.""   How do you know you almost hit your throat on the metal bar? I'm guessing that you know this based on sight. When given the sight of a metal bar as sensory input, the brain made a prediction: this is a hard metal object that will cause pain if it hits the body. Visual parts of the brain then sent a signal to predictive parts of the brain, which sent a signal to parts of the brain that feel pain. The feeling of pain was a prediction, and what you noticed was a prediction error. Prediction errors are usually surprising and easily catch attention. How exactly predictions are made about pain remains an area of active research ([source](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/843284v1.full)), but this is one idea. I don’t know why this question got downvoted, since it’s a really great question that gets into some deep neuroscience.  Edit: also, another example of predicted pain is the [rubber hand illusion](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sxwn1w7MJvk). If you use sensory input to trick the brain into perceiving a rubber hand as part of the body, suddenly hitting the rubber hand with a hammer will cause a feeling of pain as a prediction.

3214,ELI5: What makes some math problems so difficult to solve?,Pure math problems can be simple to state but very hard to show that they are true. The problem tends to be general in nature so you can't just test all alternatives  A famous example is Fermat's Last Theorem stated in 1637  It states that a\^n +b\^n = c\^n do not have an integer solution for n >2  Finding a solution of n=1 is trivial because a number to the power of 1 is itself so 1^1+1^1=2^1 => 1+1=2  It is alos easy to find a solution for n=2    3^2+4^2=5^2 => 9+16=15  The problem is now how do you show that there is not a solution for n>2?  If you just test different options you can only show that there is not a solution for the one you have tested. You can test a lot of numbers on a computer but the number you have tested will always be limited.  If you like to test it for a b and n less than 1 billion you start to reach calculation time for a computer longer than the age of the universe. Even if you could do that calculation how do you know there is not a solution when some number are in the trillions?   There is an infinite number of integers so it is impossible to test all alternatives.  So to show the statement is true you need to discover a lot of maths and in 1995 ane 129 pages long proof was published by Andrew Wiles.

3217,ELI5 - Why does someone wake up feeling more tired after a lot/good night of sleep but feels more awake after a little/bad night of sleep?,"A big factor is sleep cycles. If you sleep full cycles, and wake up in between them, you will feel more rested. If you wake up in the middle of a cycle, you won't. For many people, a sleep cycle lasts around 90 minutes, and you should try and sleep in multiples of 90 minutes - 7.5 hours is good, while (amusingly) 8 is not. Of course, this varies from person to person: maybe your sleep cycle is 120 minutes, in which case 7.5 hours would be bad, and 8 hours good. You won't know for sure until you experiment a little.","I've heard of this approach a few times, but I'm a bit confused as to how you'd ""experiment a little"".

3219,eli5 : how do signals transmit sound and visual images through waves?,"A fundamental wave has three properties:   - Amplitude. How much the wave varies from high to low.   - Frequency. How often the wave repeats.   - Phase. How much the start of the wave is offset from time 0.  You can sum up any number of different fundamental waves to get a composite signal. You can also de-construct that composite signal into its component waves.  Now, we want to encode a message into our wave. The way we do this is by varying one or more of the amplitude, frequency or phase of the wave.  For example, the most basic form of modulation is Amplitude Modulation - the basis of AM radio. This is an analog system where the changing amplitude of our wave can be read as another wave - a wave that encodes the information we want.  Most modern communications is built off of variations of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation, where you use fixed variations of frequency/amplitude/phase to encode digital values (4 in the case of 'Quadrature', although more complex systems exist).",I’m sure this is correct… but was not explained like we were 5.
