3300,ELI5: How does raising interest rates slow/lower inflation?,"Inflation means too much money is moving too quickly, chasing after a limited quantity of goods so the price of goods rises.  Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage payments for home owners and higher cost of borrowing for people who want to borrow money to build things like homes.  Banks are allowed to lend out something like 20x the amount of cash they actually have, so when people borrow at low interest rates money is basically being created out of nothing and put into the economy chasing after the finite amount of real goods available.  Higher interest rates discourage borrowing so they are slowing the flow of cash and instead encouraging people to pay off their debts which will allow for borrowing in the future when we want to Rev up the economy.",Do people really take out loans to pay for food often enough to move the price? Seems like a interest hike would punish people that hold big-ticket debt (like mortgages) and not do anything to curb inflation in essential consumables.,Related,How do higher interest rates encourage people to pay off their debts?

3301,"ELI5: Why do computers slow down, but then you restart them and they work again?","There are several reasons, but one of the most-common reasons is that everything you do on your computer takes up some of the limited memory in the computer (specifically the RAM, or Random Access Memory, which is different than space on a disk).  As you do things on the computer, such as browse Reddit, your computer keeps taking up more memory with every post you click, every photo you view, every link you click.  When that memory becomes more limited, your computer operates more slowly, as it struggles to try to ""find a place to fit more stuff.""  However, once you restart your computer, most of that memory is wiped clean and you start fresh, so your computer is often faster.  Basically, on a restart, your computer ""empties the trash can,"" so you can start filling it up again, without constantly having to try to compact the trash to fit more in the can.",Interesting.

Think of it like a plate of spaghetti, look at what happens when you grab a couple of forks and 'stretch' the pile. Same thing\`s happening in that plastic.
