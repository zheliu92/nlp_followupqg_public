3013,ELI5: Why are planes not getting faster?,The short version is nobody cares about going faster.  Jet engines and planes have improved tremendously in efficiency.  In the last 60 years the average fuel burn dropped over 45%.which is an insane improvement.   And less fuel is cheaper flights and more profit.,"And perhaps the biggest cause of that fuel burn decrease is the switch from turbojet engines to turbofans. A modern turbofan has very much in common with a turboprop, in that 90% of the thrust is generated by the fan in the front of the engine (pretty much a propeller with 20-30(?) blades). This is what makes modern jet engines so wide in comparison to their slender cousins from the 60s",Related,How do jet engines and planes have improved in efficiency over the last 60 years?

3014,ELI5: Why are planes not getting faster?,Another point is that the benefit for increased speed is marginal when typical flights aren’t all that long to begin with and when a good portion of the time of the flight is due to air traffic control issues and on-the-ground taxiing at the airport. I remember my dad (who worked for a major airline) commenting about how flights to Southern California took 45 minutes longer than when he started even though the planes were faster — all due to traffic and airport issues.,Arrive 2+ hours before your one-hour flight to allow time for security checks... ok. Allow 1+ hours for that layover in a major metro in case the first leg runs late. So who cares if a new plane could save six minutes in the air? There is 100x more time to be saved on airports and aircraft that are apparently just too dense for the public to use safely or for operators to put on direct routes even once a day. And those are just the 20-year-old problems... unmitigated carbon emissions and airborne disease transmission are something else entirely.,Slightly Related,What are the challenges associated with maintaining runway operations at high speeds?
