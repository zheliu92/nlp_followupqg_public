3160,ELI5: What happens when there's too much honey in a bee hive but there's no one to collect it?,"They call this condition ""honeybound""  Queens need open cells to lay eggs... If a colony becomes too cramped in their hive they will create a new set of queens and all the oldest bees and the old queen fly away to start a new hive in some other new space.. the young bees remain behind taking care of the new queens and new baby bees... the new queens have fatal duels until only one remains... typically if the first queen to emerge is healthy she will be allowed to go kill the other queens  before they escape their cocoons... if the best queen is slow to emerge workers will protect that area from a lesser but quicker to emerge queen who would certainly eliminate that better competition given the opportunity.  If the space is extremely cramped or the colony exceptionally populous, they may also send a couple more swarms with newly emerged queens rather than having them duel down to one...  Ideally the best new queen takes the original colony... the old queen starts up a new hive elsewhere... if they're especially fortunate 2-3 minor swarms with new queens also begin anew.  Those minor swarms do not have great odds of survival but sometimes nature finds a way.  Update: thanks so much for all the gifts and goofy comments you all made my day = )  I've only been a bee keeper for a single season, but I take that responsibility seriously so I've tried my best to learn as much as I can so I can be a proper steward of my lil beebies.  I wouldn't call myself an expert by any means but I tell myself to learn like I'll live forever and serve like there's no tomorrow. I try to spend at least a little chunk of time learning more about bees everyday! They're fascinating and I'm a biologist so it's really a joy to learn all about them!  I'd like to encourage anyone and everyone who isn't allergic to work with bees and learn about them and help local bee keeper or become one yourself!  They're marvelous creatures and truly altruistic... working with them has been extremely rewarding and fulfilling... the hardest part is waiting for winter to pass.  As for how the bees select their favored queen? I guess that's one of their secrets, I only know about it because I've seen the way some workers guard their favorite unopened queen cell. I could scratch up a few paragraphs of ideas about factors that go into it but I'm already rambling hahaha... likely there is a lot to it.

3167,ELI5: How do childhood memories cause trauma if you can't remember them?,"Do you remember the first time you spoke the word ""candy""?   I bet you don't.  But you remember that you liked candy when you were a child, don't you? Even though you don't have the first memory, you still have a sensation about the word.  We don't remember every thing that happens to us when we're a small child. But some events do cause us to form impressions that are good or bad about certain things.   We might lose the memory over time, but we don't lose the impression that it caused. So it might result in, say, a fear of dogs if we were bitten by a dog, even if we don't remember it. Or it might make us nervous to be around someone older that's friendly, because (sorry, this will be sad) someone older that was friendly abused us when we were a small child.

3169,ELI5: What is with the abortion-banning law currently happening in Texas?,"Going to get removed, but here is your answer.  They didn't ban them. They just made the restrictions so tight that they are effectively banned. The SCOTUS allowed reasonable restrictions on abortions in Casey, and many states have been pushing the limit on what is 'reasonable.'  The Texas legislature passed the most restrictive bill in recent memory. Abortions after 6 weeks are basically forbidden, which means that almost all women will be too far along for an abortion by the time they realize they are pregnant.  Historically, the SCOTUS has struck down laws like this that were overly restrictive, but in this case (in a 5-4 decision) the decided reject an emergency injunction - meaning the law is in effect until the larger case is heard.  So, for now, abortions are banned in Texas in every way that matters.",So the legislation is effective right after it's passed without a window period?,Related,How does Texas's approach to regulating medical practices contrast with the approach taken by other states?
