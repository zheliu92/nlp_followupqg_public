3330,ELI5: How can film tape hold so much information?,"As others have mentioned, film is analog which means the color 'data,' is stored physically on each grain of the film. Since these grains are super tiny (far tinier than the pixels on a screen) we can get really high resolutions from them before they start to become blurry.  Also ""tiny memory card,"" vs ""tiny flat frame of film,"" is also not quite a fair comparison since:  * A digital film will be compressed. This means throwing away some of the data/detail in order to save on file size. An uncompressed 4k movie would be hundreds of GB (if not more). There's no such thing as ""compressing,"" film, so we get all the detail captured by the camera basically for free. * An entire IMAX film isn't just a single frame of film. It's a reel about the size of a table which is WAY larger than a memory card. * While a memory card might be made of billions of transistors, each *frame* on a strip is made of billions of grains.
