3312,ELI5: Can singularities be ever formed from an outsiders perspective?,"A quick note on terminology; the ""singularity"" is the theoretical point right in the centre of a massive object where its density and gravitational field are infinite under current best models. They may exist, or the models may be not quite right (e.g. quantum mechanics may get in the way). Black holes may have singularities at their centre. But black holes don't ""need"" singularities, they are defined by their event horizons.  The ""event horizon"" is the region around a black hole (technically a 2d surface) that makes a black hole special; it is the point where all worldlines (so future paths in spacetime - where things *could* go) of objects in that region end up falling down towards the massive object in the middle (see [this neat set of diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BH-no-escape-1.svg)). In the simple model for a black hole, the event horizon is a distance of 2GM/c^2 from the singularity (where G is the gravitational constant, M the total mass inside the event horizon and c the 'speed of light').  A black hole forms when there is enough mass within a small enough volume so that this distance (2GM/c^(2)) is outside the object. All that mass doesn't have to be concentrated at the singularity, it just has to be within the event horizon distance of it.  At the event horizon, from the perspective of an observer an infinite distance away, time dilation would be infinite. So when observing something fall into a black hole, you can never see the object cross the event horizon, it will just slow down and stop (and you can obviously never see it cross, as the light of it crossing can never reach you).  But locally everything looks normal. From the perspective of an object falling into the black hole, it doesn't notice the event horizon (although they'll be a lot of other stuff going on there - it won't be a friendly place to hang out), it just keeps falling. [This graphic shows this fairly well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gravitational_time_dilation_around_a_black_hole.gif) - on the left you have what things look like from the object's perspective as it falls in. On the right you have the outside observer's view. From the object's point of view, it just falls in as normal.  Of course, *this only applies once the black hole has formed*, so once the event horizon exists. Before then, the time dilation in that region, while significant, wouldn't be infinite. So there would still be time for things to fall in.  Disclaimer; I haven't done the maths (GR maths is notoriously difficult), but I suspect that yes, if you were an infinite distance away, it would take an infinite amount of time for a black hole to form. But if you are an infinite distance away none of that matters - you are too far away. If you are any closer (i.e. a finite distance away), it would take less than an infinite amount of time to form - and so it is possible.  And we know this is possible; black holes exist.","First of all, thank you for your elaborate answer.  I do, or I think I do, know the difference between a  singularity, an event horizon and a black hole. That's why my question asked specifically about *singularities*.

3314,Eli5 How do rich people pay little to no taxes on their income?,"in simple terms, the trick is to have as little income as possible compared to your wealth.

3316,ELI5: what do atoms look like?,">but they have to actually look like something right?  They don't.   In fact, individual atoms *can't* look like anything. They're too small.  The smallest thing the human eye is capable of seeing is a blue photon with a 400 nanometer wavelength. Anything smaller than that is utterly invisible. And atoms are over a thousand times smaller than that.   We can still *visualize* things that a smaller than that by using an electron microscope that uses electrons instead of light, but that's all it is, a visualization. Any colour in it is entirely false.  As for texture, that depends on what sort of texture you're talking about. A video-game style texture with different colours isn't possible since the colours are all too large. A physical bump map texture isn't possible since nothing ever touches subatomic particles (except other subatomic particles in nuclear reactors/detonations).   Protons and neutrons do consist of varying amounts of quarks but... well, when I say varying, that means quarks are constantly being created from nothing and disappearing to the same, so even if you could see them (which you can't without destroying what you're looking at) you wouldn't be able to use that to tell subatomic particles apart.","While particles do interact, wouldnt them actually touch themselves violate the pauli's exclusion principle?  Edit: well, outside situations where particle degeneracy pressure limit is exceeded....",Related,What is the significance of the electron microscope in showing smaller sizes of atoms?
