3250,"Eli5 If I toss a ball while on a motorcycle, would it land on my hand or would it drop?","In a perfect vacuum, if you threw the ball up by tossing it up in the palm of your hand, it would keep moving forward with you and return to your  palm perfectly.  You can duplicate this effect in an evironment with an enclosed atmosphere, like a bus or a train or a car.  A motorcycle, however, does not have an enclosed atmosphere and cannot be ridden in a vacuum (internal combustion engines need oxygen).  So on a motorcycle, the ball will be hit by the molecules of the air, which is moving slower than the motorcycle, and it will slow down in the horizontal direction, and fall behind your hand.","So, if i toss a ball(say a tennis ball) on a moving motorcycle at point A then by the time the ball comes down I would have moved to point so it'll probably fall on the ground, since i have moved??",Related,What is the role of air pressure in the motion of the ball on a motorcycle?

3251,Eli5 What is the difference between a contusion (bruise) and an ecchymosis?,"They are not quite interchangeable.  Ecchymosis is discoloration of the skin resulting from bleeding underneath, usually from a bruise but not always. Specifically it refers to the skin discoloration not the underlying cause.  A contusion is when an injured blood vessel or capillaries leak blood into the surrounding tissue. This is the underlying condition, not the surface appearance.  So you see ecchymosis to diagnose a contusion, but they are not the same thing.",So the ecchymosis is the sign while the contusion is the symptom?,Strongly Related,Why is it important to differentiate between a contusion and an ecchymosis?

3252,Eli5: Edible plants and fungi. I assume we used to determine if a food was edible by trial and error for most of the past. How would we determine newly discovered food edible today without jeopardizing health or life?,"The same process still applies, many survivalists have it memorized and use it in the field. It's called the Universal Edibility Test. It's a several step process that takes most of the day to accomplish.  First, you seperate out the various parts. You need to test roots, leaves, stems, buds, and flowers independently, because sometimes one part will be poisonous while another isn't.   You give each bit a good smell. Strong and unpleasant odors are usually a bad sign, and if you're in the field you'll just generally discard them without further testing.   You test for contact poisoning by placing a tiny piece on your wrist for just a moment. If it burns, itches, numbs, or breaks into a rash, you just discard it.  Then you boil each bit individually. Test each piece by briefly touching it to your lips, and then waiting 15-30 minutes to see if anything happens. After that, you can take a small piece into your mouth, chew a couple of times, and hold it in your mouth for 15-30 minutes to see if anything happens. If it's bitter or soapy, you just discard it.  If there's no reaction at all, swallow it and wait the rest of the day. If there's no ill effect after several hours, you can assume this part of the plant is edible. Repeat the process for each individual part of the plant. Many plants have both edible and inedible parts to them, so this can take several days.     As far as fungi goes... just don't. If you're in the field and you can't determine the exact species of mushroom you're looking at with 100% accuracy, don't touch it, don't eat it, just leave it alone. There are many kinds of mushrooms that are edible in one circumstance, but poisonous in another. Hen mushrooms are safe, but if they're growing on a conifer or cedar tree, they're poisonous.  There are scientific tests you can do on mushrooms to determine their exact chemical components and identify if any of them are poisonous, or if they combine to create something poisonous, but if you're out in the woods it's a better idea to just leave them alone.","Thank you for the detailed response.

3254,ELI5: How different early Homo Sapiens were compared to modern people?,"Anthropologists believe they were basically the same as modern humans, provided they were *Homo sapiens sapiens*.

3255,ELI5: why do our muscles shake when electricity touches us but not when light touches us. If it isnt energy that makes our muscles shake what is it?,"First of all, the light does not reach your muscles, it just reaches your skin. So it cannot have any direct effect on the muscles anyway.  But more importantly, muscles cannot just convert any sort of energy into movement, just like a diesel engine can only use diesel and not steam or wind or electricity. The energy source for muscles is a specific chemical ""fuel"" in your body called ATP, muscles can only use that and nothing else.  However, while the ATP is the energy source, your brain has to control the muscles somehow, and it does that - simplifying here - by sending electric impulses along your nerves. If you touch an electric cable, the electricity will cause havoc with this communications system - your muscles believe that they're given random, frantic orders, and act accordingly.  So, in short - muscle spasm don't happen because of too much energy, but because they recieve random orders.","why does electricity penetrate skin but not light, they are both energy right?",Related,What is the significance of the absence of electrical signals in muscle movement when touching the skin compared to electrical signals?

3258,Eli5 how we extract meaning from the language we read? Do we link words to pictures in our mind?,"Your brain stores knowledge more as abstract concepts.
