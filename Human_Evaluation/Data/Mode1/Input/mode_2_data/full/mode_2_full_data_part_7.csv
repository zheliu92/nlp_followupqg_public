3060,ELI5: Orange lies between red and yellow on the spectrum and can be made by mixing red and yellow pigments. Then how come violet can be made by mixing red and blue even though it doesn't lie between them on the spectrum?,"Purple is essentially a color our brains made up. It's how we interpret light that has lots of red wavelengths and lots of blue wavelengths, but little to no green. The purples are not ""spectral colors"" meaning they don't correspond to a single wavelength of light.  ""Violet"" is weird because it is actually is a spectral color, it's the lowest possible wavelength without being ultraviolet and thus invisible to the human eye. Because our eyes aren't very sensitive to this wavelength ""true"" violet usually looks dark and hard to see.","Ok that makes sense. But then the question is: do we know why our brains assign the same or similar perceived color for a mix of blue and red (purple) as ""true"" violet?",Strongly Related,How does the human eye's sensitivity to violet differ from that of other colors?

3062,ELI5: Why do we feel sick when we get hungry sometimes? It seems counter productive.,"This is only the case in some instances, but with an 'empty' stomach the PH level of the stomach 'juice' is higher, which is irritating, especially if it gets into your oesophagus.

This means when the stomach is empty, the stomach and oesopagus become irritated and it can lead to throwing up, or feeling we need to throw up.

3063,"ELI5: If my VR headset display has a limited and certain amount of pixels, how do games upscale pixel density beyond full resolution?","I believe you're talking about VR Supersampling. Essential your computer screen (or VR screens in this case) can only output a certain resolution of pixels.(this is called the ""Native resolution"") Each pixel can only display one color at a time. When these pixels do not line up perfectly vertically or horizontally they can look jagged. (Imagine drawing a straight line on MS paint: totally smooth. Now draw a 45° angled line: looks like a staircase) This jagged effect is called aliasing. To mitigate this effect, games offer anti-aliasing features such as Supersampling.  Supersampling renders an image at a higher resolution than the computer screen can output, takes an average of the pixel colors in an area and blends them all together, displaying the blended colors at the native resolution. This sort of smooths the edges of those not perfectly straight lines so that they appear less jagged and more natural.   So, your screen is still displaying the same amount of pixels, and the pixels are only displaying one color each, but the colors displayed by each pixel are slightly different.","Are you referring to SSAA?

This is a mental condition which leads to periods of extreme highs (manic episodes) and extreme lows (periods of depression). It can be moderated by medication, but it can be tricky to find a balance of meds that suits the person; one reason is that some people with the condition are creative and don’t like the way the meds can blunt their manic episodes (during which they can feel invigorated and productive).

3069,ELI5: Why don't dentists and eye doctors have to go to regular medical school?,"The simplest explanation is that dentistry and optometristry are more about tools and minimally invasive procedures than they are about internal biology. They don't actually perform surgery, and if surgery is needed they refer their patients to actual M.D.s to either diagnose more complicated issues or perform surgeries.  They don't need to worry about things that don't involve the procedures they do, and they really only diagnose things that they can see with a quick look(measurement of eyesight/astigmatism, abcess/cavity/etc.) and do what is needed to correct them right then and there, whether it's a root canal or determining the correct lens strength. They don't need to know the workings of the body to do these things, they're only interested in the things that relate to the procedures they do.  They can only use anesthesia if they are trained in it, and it's not only doctors that can use it. If the dentist isn't trained in it, he can have a CRNA that is to administer it.  Also, doctors are not the only people that are able to write prescriptions, and dentists and optometrists are included in that, though what they are allowed to prescribe is determined at a state or local level.","Then there is the flip side to my question as well, why are there not more specialized schools? A podiatrist doesn't need to know the same things an OB does but they both have the same gen ed in medical school.",Related,What are some specific examples of minimally invasive procedures that dentists and eye doctors might perform?
