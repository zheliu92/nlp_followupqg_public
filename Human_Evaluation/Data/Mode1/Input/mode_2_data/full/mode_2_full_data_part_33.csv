3321,"ELI5 Why humans, unlike other animals like insects or bats not driven by their genetic instincts?","The same reason those other species have instincts. A coincidence of resources, circumstances, and/or sexual selection tendencies that shaped our evolution. i.e. Instincts helped some species survive.  Humans depend on their instincts less presumably because our other non-instinctive tendencies are more effective at causing successful reproduction and survival to reproductive age.  Neurologists argue that mutations in the human brain structure caused larger distances between the more primitive parts of our brain and memory storing areas. This distance that neural impulses need to travel still had to fit in a small skull which caused some cross-over signals to occur. Erroneous associations between things like recalling a memory of a tiger being dangerous and painful and that sharp rock you sat on to be similarly painful may constitute what we call ""creativity"" and enable ideas like using sharp rocks to defend from sharp tigers. This kind of association was not due to logical discourse but an accidental and irrational association of two mildly similar things due to neurons firing incorrectly. This erroneous processing that gave rise to creativity was selected for over and over due to its apparent value in creative problem solving.  So, it might be argued that creative problem solving has been a more effective means of survival, reproduction, and/or survival of young to reproductive age.

3325,ELI5 UK: how are mortgage rates so low?,"Major Central Banks (and the Exchequer) are pumping money into their economies through quantitative easing (QE). This is the Central Bank buying back government bonds from banks and therefore putting cash into the accounts of the banks. And this cash is not earning much when redeposited with the CB or when lent to other banks (near zero and sometimes negative rates).   Banks are therefore literally sitting on funds that they are not earning any money from if they cannot lend it to others. This explains their willingness to lend at very low rates. These loans (it is hoped) goes into productive investment and therefore helps push up economic activity through wage increases and consumption. Unfortunately, this cash also goes into asset purchases like property and the stock market which isn't exactly ideal (rising property prices and share prices leading to asset price ""bubbles"") Ultimately this kind of expansionary policy tends to lead to higher inflation which is what many people are fearing is happening now.   Until the Central Banks dial back this policy either by slowing down (tapering off) QE or by increasing interest rates, this might continue. The problem here is that while tapering and increasing interest dials down inflation pressure (the intended effect) it also risks a large fall in asset prices (housing and stock markets). The problem with rapidly falling asset prices is that this can lead to enormous pressure on banks to dial back quickly on loans (fearing loan defaults) and this becomes a multiplying effect on slowing down the economy (since a lot of economic activity relies on bank credit. This can lead to a condition called stagflation - where prices increase AND economic activity decreases, essentially the worst of both worlds.   Long story short, it is very possible that the Central Banks are willing to accept (hopefully temporary) higher inflation while trying to avoid massive and sudden asset price deflation. This is a very delicate path to take.","Thanks for that clear explanation!  Can Central Banks adjust their deposit rates based on a bank’s loan portfolio?

3327,ELI5: Why does people insist that billionaires share/give away wealth that they earned through hardwork and sacrifices?,"Because many such people believe that the wealth of the very did not come purely through hard work and sacrifice, but also through some combination of market forces outside their control, specific public policy designs, and pure luck.  There are many potential examples. Patents, for example, are a construct of the law that have helped many people benefit from their inventions. Or how the government allocates limited public resources like land or broadcast frequencies.

The same applies to your memories - memories are the pattern of connections between brain cells. If all the cells in a connection are replaced, but the new cells are connected in the same way, then the memory remains the same, because the memory is the pattern of the connection, not the molecules that make it up.   If that's not clear enough, take an analogy. You have a lego set, let's say it's the Batmobile. If you take it apart, you still have all the pieces, but you no longer have the Batmobile. If you buy a copy of every piece separately and swap them into the model one by one, you still have the Batmobile, but none of the pieces are the original pieces. Your memory is the Batmobile, not the pieces.","I am able to grasp what you said here, but it gives rise to another question - don't brain cells (neurons) undergo a cell division? Wouldn't there be extra cells in the place of a dead/dying cell? How does that pan out in the scheme of replacing a neural connection identical to previous one in order to persist memories?",Related,What is synaptic plasticity and how does it relate to memory?

3329,ELI5: How can film tape hold so much information?,"Because Film is analogue. A single spot on a piece of film can store a huge range of data (i.e. it can be anywhere between fully transparent or fully opaque, almost infinitely finely adjustable). A single bit can only be on or off, so you need much more bits to store this much fine detail","Is that really the case? I thought that each silver halide grain is binary: the whole grain either receives enough light to turn opaque or it doesn't. There are lots of grains in each color layer, and they're distributed in a random pattern from frame to frame. Essentially, then, chemical photography is no more analog than digital photography is.",Strongly Related,What is the significance of the film's ability to be both transparent and opaque?
