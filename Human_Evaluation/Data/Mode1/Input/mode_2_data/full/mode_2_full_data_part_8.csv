3070,ELI5: How can you convert liabilities to equity?,"There are two primary ways for a company to raise money: taking on liabilities (selling bonds or taking other loans) and selling equity in the company (stock).  You are correct, if a company has $1 million in bonds issued or loans taken, they are in $1 million of debt. However, they can create a stock offering for investors to buy equity in the company for $1 million. Then they can take the $1 million generated from the sale of stock and use it to pay off their liabilities. Thus, turning liability into equity.","Oh ok I see, makes sense now. So essentially there will be more shareholders and thus more equity, but the liabilities would still have to be paid in the long run. Why is this conversion usually seen as a good thing?",Related,What are the two primary ways a company can raise money through issuing new shares?

So if someone says they're on a vegetarian diet, but they eat fish...they aren't actually on a vegetarian diet. A vegetarian diet generally doesn't include *anything* that an animal has to die to provide. So it can include eggs, dairy, etc...but no meat of any kind (fish included). A vegan diet, cuts all animal-based products as well.","In hindsight it might be worth rephrasing my initial question; some people are vegetarians for health reasons, others for moral/animal rights reasons, and still others for other reasons they chose that I can't remember at the moment.    Why are fish sometimes the exception, health, morality, or otherwise?",Related,Can you explain the concept of omnivory and its impact on fish consumption?
