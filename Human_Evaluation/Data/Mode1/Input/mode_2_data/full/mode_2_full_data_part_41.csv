3409,"ELI5: How does electrical ""draw"" work? How does the circuit know how much energy the devices plugged into it need?","That's what electrical engineers are for.  Voltage pushes the electrons through the wire. If you run a direct wire between the live and ground prongs of your outlet, there is little to impede their flow and you get a flood of electrons - breakers in your house shut off power when this happens.  Devices limit their current draw in different ways. Basic resistive components have a resistance - they are highly imperfect conductors and so electrons encounter a lot of resistance as they try to move. This hinders the flow. One of the most basic equations you'll find in electronics is V=IR, which describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.  Other devices may use inductive or capacitive limits - AC power is constantly trying to change, and these components can limit it by either requiring or resisting change - unlike a resistor these do not turn energy into heat and so are more efficient.  More modern supplies switch on and off. By switching on and off faster or slower, we can limit how much power flows through without bulky capacitors or inductors and without the waste of resistors. Semiconductor technology has made this solution very cheap.  There are many more methods, but that's the basics.","This is a helpful answer, thanks. Are you saying that the power flowing through the wall socket (""power source"") is constantly adjusting the amount of energy it's sending to the devices downstream?",Strongly Related,How do resistive components limit the flow of electrical current?
