3361,ELI5: Is fungi in the air everywhere? How does mold just on appear out of nowhere on something that sits in your house if there's moisture? How does mold and fungi work?,"Mold spores are ubiquitous - they are pretty much everywhere.  Normal indoor spore count ranges from 500 to 5,000 spores per cubic meter, and outdoor spore counts can be as much as 50,000 spores per cubic meter in summer and fall in many areas.  Moldy buildings can have much higher spore counts, sometimes as high as 500,000 spores per cubic meter.

How does mold and fungi work?,"There are bilions upon bilions of spores in the air everywhere. If the conditions are just right the spores germinate and form mycelium which is the 'nervous and digestive system' of of fungus. After the mycelium mat is firmly established, gets enough nutrients, is mature and the conditions are right the fruiting starts and mycelium produces fruit bodies known to us as mushrooms. The mushrooms produce spores in the gills (for the gilled ones of course) which fall from them in the hundreds of thousands per mushroom (it starts as soon as the mushroom cap opens), then are taken away by the wind and the whole cycle continues.

How does mold and fungi work?,"Intense heat or intense cold can shock mold spores to sprout mycelium.

3366,Eli5: Can’t we just send our trash into the sun?,"It's not a terrible question, but you have to understand that it's really hard to get things out of earth's gravity.  Imagine lifting a garbage truck into space.   Space is only about 100 km away, but lifting things this far takes a huge amount of energy.  The equation for how much energy is simple, just mass (in grams) times the gravitational acceleration (10 m/s^(2)) times height in meters.  So if you want to lift a ton of garbage to space, you're looking at 1,000,000 g x 10 m/s^(2) x 100,000 meters = 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion) Joules of energy.  If we translate that into food, that becomes 239,000,000 kilocalories (same as dietary calories)  Basically this is the amount of energy used by about 120,000 humans in a day.  Or, put another way, 1 trillion joules is the amount of energy stored in 70 million aa batteries.

What you're missing is that I and V in that equation can't vary independently if the circuit itself is fixed. Since V = IR, and R is fixed, reducing the current necessarily means reducing the voltage. If you, say, halve the current, then you also halve the voltage, which means your new power loss is (1/2 \* original current)(1/2 \* original voltage) = 1/4 the original power loss, just as the formula I^(2)R would suggest.  Or, if you prefer to not fix resistance, changing the resistance changes (because of V = IR) at least one of I or V as well.","Another thing that popped up, how is the electrical power formula VI if the energy lost is also VI?  There's no way all the electrical power is lost through heat right?",Related,What is the significance of reducing current in the context of energy loss?
