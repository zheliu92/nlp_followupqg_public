3088,[ELI5] What is the imaginary number 'i'? Why is it so important? Where does it show up and How does it apply in the real world (examples and explanation)?,"The number i is ""imaginary"" in the same way negative numbers are imaginary.  You can't have negative sheep in a barn. The whole concept is made-up, but we figured out that if we continue the number line past zero, we can use those made-up numbers in tons of different ways, namely, to represent something that flips between two states. Above freezing vs. below freezing, credit vs. debt, clockwise vs. counter-clockwise, so on.  The number i is just taking that concept further and extending the number line perpendicularly up and down. Like negative numbers, this extension gives us tools to describe a more cyclic kind of flipping: instead of simply going from 1 to -1, we can rotate around 0 by going up to i and then below to -i in between.  The exact applications of that are somewhat obscure and math-heavy, but they pop up in equations modeling many periodic motions and waveforms. Since a sine wave happens in two dimensions, having a number system in place which can work in two dimensions is immensely useful. Fourier transformation, for example, is incredibly common in all kinds of signal handling, and it relies on the complex plane. That's an ELI5 of its own, but [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) has a visual introduction if you're interested in it.","so in other words...  If ""normal math"", like (1+1) or (73 * 48), I can call 1-dimensional math, then the use of i in complex numbers (a + bi) enables us to do 2-dimensional math?

3089,ELI5: How do Sun Lamps simulate actual sunlight?,"It's about what kinds of wavelengths of light it produces and in what amount. Some lights peak in bluer/violeter(is that a word?) wavelengths. Some peak in the reds and oranges and produce a ""warmer"" light.  Sunlight peaks around Green wavelengths but has a pretty good spread of other colors. It also contains a lot of UV-A and UV-B(Ultra-Violets), which many animal species like reptiles and birds need to be healthy. So when you see these sun lamps, they're often advertised as producing UV light so pet owners know it's what they want. Light bulbs we buy for our homes or offices are only worried about the visible wavelengths and wouldn't be healthy for these animals because they're missing the UV.","Thank you!  So - if I'm understanding this correctly - UV-A and UV-B are what tans skin, enables plants to conduct photosynthesis, etc, and they're \*just wavelengths of light\*?
