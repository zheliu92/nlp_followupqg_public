3281,ELI5: Why is it impossible to suck through a straw that's 10.4 meters long?,"The action of sucking does not actually pull on water. Rather, it allows the air on the other end to push by removing the air from the end inside of your mouth.  This means that, since there is only 1 atm of air, you're limited to that much pushing.  As water climbs the tube, gravity pulls it down, generating a pressure to counteract the pushing. This pressure depends solely on the density of water and the height at the top of the water.  So, solving for the density of water, we see that water can only get 10.4 meters above its surface from the action of atmospheric pressure. If the straw goes deeper than the water's surface, then the straw itself can be longer, but the water can only be raised above its surface by that amount.  The formula for hydrostatic pressure is quite straightforward. p = ρ g h  This is the pressure generated by gravity acting on the water, and it is the pressure that counteracts the pressure of air pushing up. Interestingly, the pressure of the air itself can be found using the same formula (although to get an accurate answer you have to modify it with calculus to account for gravity and changes in density).","but what if the straw was thinner, that way as the water goes up, there is less pressure pulling it downwards therefore allows for it to go higher. and would in theory having one end of the straw be at the bottom of the mariana trench, allow the water to be sucked further past the ocean surface as there is more pressure pushing the water up due to the immense amount of water in the ocean?",Strongly Related,So water can only get 10.4 meters above its surface from the action of atmospheric pressure?

3282,ELI5: Is the inversion of entropy as depicted in Tenet (2020) scientifically accurate?,"No, it isn't.

3286,ELI5: Why do diet sodas have a short shelf life and taste terrible when they expire?,"Aspartame has an Ester as part of its chemical makeup. It is specially aspartame as far as I know that contains an ester.    Esters undergo a reaction with water called hydrolysis. Over time this sweetener breaks down (months) and the net effect is the removal of all sweetener.    The reaction turns the aspartame into a small amount of phenyl acid and methanol, each of these is broken down by your body and not harmful should you be so thirsty or unobservant as to consume several servings.    Other artificial sweeteners do not have this issue (nor do they cause brain tumors in extremely high doses), which is why sarcharin or sucralose sweeteners have become available and are seen more favorable for the stockists and the consumer.",Thank you. I had a Diet Dr. Pepper tonight that expired in June and even mixed with 50% regular Pepper it had zero taste. Does heat speed-up the effect of going bad?  It's a shame sucralose isn't more widely available in soda. Pepsi tried it a few years ago but stopped.,Related,Aspartame has an Ester as part of its chemical makeup.  Is hydrolysis the same process that breaks down sucralose?

3287,eli5 do all fires need oxygen? If so why can't a different chemical make a fire?,"Fire as we usually know it is oxidation i.e. some chemical when brought to a high enough temperature reacts with oxygen, and the reaction gives off heat. Such reactions require oxygen.   However not all reactions which give off heat (aka exothermic reactions) require oxygen. Oxygen, especially oxygen in the atmosphere, is just the most common agent for such reactions. You can have exothermic reactions with ""fuels"" where the oxygen is in the material itself (e.g. thermite reaction). You can also have reactions with other elements (e.g. chlorine, flourine) that are exothermic. Finally beyond traditional chemical reactions, nuclear fission or fusion is obviously exothermic, but do not require oxygen.","Are those other reactions still considered oxidizing reactions or are they different reactions that produce visible flame? Like if fluorine and glass react aren't you fluorinating the silica?  I'm not trying to be pedantic, genuinely curious.",Related,">However not all reactions which give off heat (aka exothermic reactions) require oxygen.   For example, when cooking with ethanol, you can use a mixture of ethanol and gasoline.  This is because ethanol is a heat-sensitive molecule, so when it comes to cooking, it's easier to heat the mixture up than it is to cool it down.  However, when you put ethanol in a fire, it will burn up the ethanol, so why not use a different chemical to make a fire?    Also, when we have a fire with a high enough temperature, it tends to burn more quickly because the flame is moving away from the source, so it's more efficient.  So if we have an extremely hot fire, why not put in a flame retardant that can quickly cool down the flame?"

3288,ELI5: Why is the space black? is it a border or is it the lack of brightness.,"Surprisingly, it's both and it's called Olbers' paradox.
