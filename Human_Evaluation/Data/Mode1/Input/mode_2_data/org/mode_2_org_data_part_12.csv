The vapor cone formed by the large object traveling at a high speed is a byproduct of the shock wave created by the object traveling so fast relative to Earth's rotational velocity (the ""vapor cone"") and the expansion of the air (the condensation of the vapor).  >When the object is traveling at high speed, it is experiencing a tremendous amount of turbulence.  The turbulence is caused by the massive air pressure being generated by the enormous object traveling very fast relative (relative to the earth's rotation) and the large air speed differences between the object and the Earth (relative (to the speed of light) making the turbulence very intense.  This turbulence is what causes the vapor cone to form.  It's a phenomenon called the ""transonic regime"".   It is a type of turbulence that occurs in the air when a massive object is moving at a speed of about Mach 1.5.  When a large plane hits this speed, the shock waves and expansion fans caused by this large object are extremely intense, and the vapor cones formed by these waves are extremely small.  So when you see a vapor cloud forming, it isn't necessarily a sign that the plane is traveling very quickly.  Instead, it may be a sign (in the case of a very large object) that the shockwave has reached its maximum and the air is no longer able to withstand the shock.  If you see the vapor cloud, it means that the object has reached a point where it is no more able to hold the air in its cabin, and therefore is no further from the Earth.  In this case, the object breaking through the sound barrier is a large meteorite (or a meteorite, or a meteor, or whatever it is)."
