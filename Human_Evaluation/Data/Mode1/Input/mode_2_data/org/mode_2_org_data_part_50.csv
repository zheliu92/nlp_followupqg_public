3490,eli5: Why did the life expectancy for people with down syndrome increase from 25 years in 1980 to 60 years today?,"During WW2 in Germany and I believe Austria, many kids and babies who were institutionalized for disabilities were killed by being out outside without sufficient clothes so they would get pneumonia and die.

3492,Eli5: Who exactly messed up in the Grenfell cladding?,"In engineering risk assessment there is a theory called the cheese model. Imagine many slices of cheese, each with some holes in random positions. Each slice of cheese represents one entity in the engineering project, and holes represent safety holes in that one entity. A risk factor (hole) in one entity can be blocked by another entity. However, sometimes you're unlucky and all the holes align. Everything is at the wrong place at the same time, and disaster happens.   Truth is, humans *will* make mistakes. It is unavoidable. Any attempts to reduce risk *will* cause risks of its own. The best we can do is to have many layers of cheese (safety mechanism) so that the chance of holes aligning (all safety mechanisms failing) is as small as possible. The desire to blame a single entity for disasters is not only wrong, but also makes the entire system prone to future disasters. If we only blame one slice of cheese for the entire disaster, problems in every other slice of cheese is not fixed, or even worse, those holes get larger due to complacency.","Yes, but surely at least one of the factors I mentioned should be major factor? If the standards were perfect, the panels accurately tested and properly installed, and the appropriate cladding was used this wouldn't have happened? This wasn't a freak accident, this was a known issue with this type of cladding that has been reproduced elsewhere and has caused other fires before and after - although none as dramatic.   I get that most engineering disasters nowadays cannot be narrowed down to such a small amount of issues - but this seems to be an exception to the rule. This sort of fire was, with the benefit of hindsight, entirely predictable based on the pre existing conditions wasn't it?

This is a very good analogy for what happened in the Grenfell Tower fire.  The problem is that the holes in the cheese are not fixed by the engineering team, but by the public. The public is left to blame the various entities responsible for the disaster, even if they are not the ones responsible for it.  This leads to a very bad conclusion: if we only blame one slice of the cheese for the entire disaster, problems in every other slice of chees is not fixed, or even worse, those holes get larger due to complacency.  In this scenario, the public is just as guilty as the engineering teams responsible for making the mistakes."

I was stuck at what you said, and I'm not sure what you mean by ""human will make mistakes"".  Humans are complex creatures with many moving parts, and sometimes they get stuck in a rut.
