3181,ELI5: Why is the number of French military personnel so low compared to its military budget?,"I just did a rough comparison between France, the US and the UK and France actually has *more* military personnel compared to its military budget.  Including reserves, France has a military budget of roughly $50bn and 244,550 personnel. The UK has a budget of around $60bn and 190,000 personnel.  The UK and US spend about $300,000 for each person in the military while France spends about $200,000.

3187,ELI5: Why do we need so much ram in cell phones?,"Computers actually use a lot more memory than just their RAM. They also set aside a portion of your disk drive(s) called a ""swap file"". If something happens and RAM gets a little low, the OS finds some portions of RAM that haven't been used lately and transfers them to the ""swap file"". That frees up RAM for what it was doing. Disks are a LOT slower than RAM, so that's why an overloaded computer gets visibly slower: it can be in a state where EVERYTHING involves moving something to or from the swap file. So long as you don't run out of disk space, you can at least run with diminished performance.  (My laptop has 16GB of RAM. It's using 12.3 of it. I'm also using 32MB of swap file, which means I'm doing pretty well right now!)  Phones don't have big disk drives to lean on for swap files. It's only recently that they've had more than about 32GB of storage to work with. If they used some of that storage for swap files, people would be mad that they can't store as many photos, apps, or songs on their phones. Further, the kind of memory they use for their ""disks"" can actually wear out if you write data to it too much. That can take years on modern devices, but it'd be a lot faster if a swap file was constantly writing to the storage!  What happens when a phone runs out of RAM then? Well, the app said it needed some memory to do something and there's no memory. So it can't do anything. If you think about it, it can't even show you an error message! To show you an error message, it'd have to get some memory to store the message. But the phone just told it there IS no memory! So the app crashes. The phone OS tries to deal with this by closing apps you've put in the background. (This is also why having 2 apps open at once is such a restricted feature that took so long to arrive.) It hopes if you haven't looked at some app in a month you won't mind if it takes longer to start up next time.   So the best solution is to put more RAM in the phone. That means not just that the phone can run bigger things, it means it can run *more* things without having to force apps to quit. That also means phones need more RAM to do the same things as PCs.","Interesting point, I thought the newer disks (SSD or flash storage) has a controller that balances write operation so that no segment is written too many times to wear out sooner. So it should be okay to use swap files on phones, no?",Related,">What happens when a phone runs out of RAM then? Well, the app said it needed some memory to do something and there's no memory.

Disks are a LOT slower than RAM, so that's why an overloaded computer gets visibly slower: it can be in a state where EVERYTHING involves moving something to or from the swap file. So long as you don't run out of disk space, you can at least run with diminished performance.  (My laptop has 16GB of RAM. It's using 12.3 of it. I'm also using 32MB of swap file, which means I'm doing pretty well right now!)  Phones don't have big disk drives to lean on for swap files. It's only recently that they've had more than about 32GB of storage to work with. If they used some of that storage for swap files, people would be mad that they can't store as many photos, apps, or songs on their phones. Further, the kind of memory they use for their ""disks"" can actually wear out if you write data to it too much. That can take years on modern devices, but it'd be a lot faster if a swap file was constantly writing to the storage!  What happens when a phone runs out of RAM then? Well, the app said it needed some memory to do something and there's no memory. So it can't do anything. If you think about it, it can't even show you an error message! To show you an error message, it'd have to get some memory to store the message. But the phone just told it there IS no memory! So the app crashes. The phone OS tries to deal with this by closing apps you've put in the background. (This is also why having 2 apps open at once is such a restricted feature that took so long to arrive.) It hopes if you haven't looked at some app in a month you won't mind if it takes longer to start up next time.   So the best solution is to put more RAM in the phone. That means not just that the phone can run bigger things, it means it can run *more* things without having to force apps to quit. That also means phones need more RAM to do the same things as PCs.","Interesting point, I thought the newer disks (SSD or flash storage) has a controller that balances write operation so that no segment is written too many times to wear out sooner. So it should be okay to use swap files on phones, no?",Related,"So basically, if I had a phone with 16GB of RAM and it crashed every time I opened it, I'd have to force it to restart?"

3189,ELI5: what is a non-linear partial differential equation?,"Since I have no idea what your level of background knowledge is, I’m going to just break down the whole phrase.  Let’s start with *differential equation*.  “Differential” is calculus-speak for “change”, or “rate of change”.  A *differential equation* is an equation, or a math statement, that tells you how fast something is changing, in terms of other things. A classic example is unrestrained bacterial cell division. Given sufficient space and resources, every bacteria cell can divide into 2 new cells each “cycle” (t). So if we have 2 cells, we gain +2 cells each cycle. If we have 10 cells, we gain +10 cells. In general, if we have *Y* cells, then we gain *Y* cells every cycle. In calculus speak:  > dY / dt = Y  where dY / dt means “how fast Y is changing each cycle (t). This is also called a *derivative* or a *differential*, making this a *differential equation*.  What about a *Partial* differential equation?  The “partial” means that there is more than 1 other variable that is going to affect things. In the above example, we only cared about how many bacteria would grow *per cycle*, or per unit of time. In calculus speak: we took the derivative of Y *with respect to* time (or “cycle”). What if the bacteria were growing along a wall, and bacteria at one end of the wall had more food and could grow faster than those at the other end of the wall? Now Y, the number of bacteria, depends not only on how much time has passed (t), but what position along the wall we are (x). So, we can take the *partial* derivative ∂Y/∂t, but we *also* need to take the partial derivative ∂Y/∂x to get the whole picture. ~~Note, these “d”s are usually lowercase Greek deltas when referring to partial derivatives.~~  Finally, *non-linear* refers to the exponents in the equation itself. “Linear” means variables are only raised to the first power and aren’t multiplied together. Our first example was linear, because the right side of the equation only has Y raised to the first power. If the number of bacteria along this wall changes by the *square* of the number of bacteria for each incremental step along the wall, we have  > ∂Y/∂x = Y^2  Which is a nonlinear partial differential equation.  EDIT: made some corrections based on comment below by u/angrious, including updating the partial derivative symbol to the correct one and changing the final equation to actually be non-linear.","This did a really good job explaining this, but can I ask what the point of nonlinear differential equations are then?

For example, suppose we have a series of cells, each with a unique number of cells (say 10 cells).   Suppose we have an equation that tells us how fast each cell is dividing, and that equation is a differential.  Suppose that we took the derivative of Y with respect to time (or “cycle”).

Now, if we take the differential equation and add in the number *of* cells, we get the differential differential equation ∂DY/Dt = *Y^2   Now that we have the differential, we can see that the difference between the two values is the *total* change in the cell number, and not the *partial* change.  So if we have 10 cells, and a wall of 1 meter, and 1 meter x, we gain 10 cells each cycle.  If we have 100 cells, then we gain 100 cells each time we go through the wall.
