3390,"ELI5 Human can max see 3 colors, do we know the exact frequencies?","I think it is misleading you to call them red, green, and blue color receptors. In reality each of these receptors responds partially to all light waves in the visible range.

We call them red, green, and blue because of where the strongest response is, but if someone has only green cones for some reason their eyes still respond perfectly well to pure red light - it'll just look like slightly less vivid light of whatever their perception is of the only color they can see.  When we see a particular color, our brain is doing a relatively complex computation - it looks at how much each cone is activated, and compares this to situational things like what color the illuminating light appears to be in a scene. To do this it necessarily has to already have assumptions about what colors make sense, to use as a reference.

This is a misconception. In reality each of these receptors responds partially to all light waves in the visible range.  So if you have 3 eyes, each of them has 3 different types of receptors, and each of those receptors is activated by a single photon, you can see 3 different colors in a single light wave.  But if you take 3 different photons, and you put them in a room with a different colored light source, you'll see 3 distinct colors in the same room.  This happens because each of the 3 receptors responds to a different frequency of light, and the light is transmitted via different paths.  The question then becomes, how do we know which frequencies each receptor is responding to?"

This is a misconception. Humans have plenty of surface area. We have a lot of land that can be covered in a year.

So if we could make a house large enough to allow for both heat and cooling, we wouldn't need to rely on solar radiation.  We'd need a lot more sunlight.  And we don’t have enough sunlight.
