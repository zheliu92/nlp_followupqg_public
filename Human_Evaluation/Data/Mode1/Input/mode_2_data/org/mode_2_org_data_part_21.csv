3200,ELI5: Why do gas prices include the extra 9/10 cent on the end?,"Maybe urban legend but I thought it was to decrease theft by the cashier.

This is a misconception. If it's cold then pouring hot water on it will expand one side before the other and that stress inside the glass which might make it crack.  This isn't the case.  The problem is that when the water is hot it expands on the outside of the glass, not inside.  So if you pour hot water inside the window it will just expand again, and that's why it's not a problem.  Also, if you have a really cold car, you might want to check the inside of your car before you try this.  If you have windows that are really deep, you may want to take extra precautions.  I've had a few cars that were completely ice-free and I've tried to open the windows and it's still a problem (not to mention the fact that the water can get in through the cracks and get stuck).    I'm not saying that it's impossible to open a window with hot water, but that it might not be the best idea."

I've been in a lot of stress situations and I've always felt like I'm working harder.  Maybe it's the way I think?   If I'm stressed, I think about things differently.  If i'm happy, I feel like I can do more.  But if I'm tired, I don't feel like doing as much.  It's like I have this internal clock that tells me I'm doing something right.  When I'm happy and feel like it, I'm just doing it.  So maybe it's like a cycle of stress - if I can keep myself happy, then I can get more done.  And if I feel stressed, then maybe I can focus more."

Some is faster than others, and some are slower.  The faster wires are for the electrical impulses, while the slower wires are just for the chemical signals.  So if you have a phone line that goes from your phone to your computer, the signal will go up the fastest wires, and down the slower ones.  But if you take a phone signal from your computer to your phone, the same signal will travel down both of those wires.  Why is that?  Because the faster wires carry the electrical signal to your receiver, while slower wires carry it to your device.  Because that's how our brains work.  And the faster signals are the ones that get to your devices faster, while slow signals are just the ones getting to your brain."

Within reason, those sizes can be altered by will with a lot of experimentation and practice, especially if mimicking a smaller vocal tract size. Smaller animals physically cannot perfectly duplicate sounds of massively larger animals because size matters when it comes to acoustics.","So, and affirming that you are no expert, you would assume that the only difference is the size  of the L/P but even across species they are physically the same?

3207,ELI5: Do animals that make vocal sounds have different physical structures to their vocal chords from each other (and humans)? Or do they just use a similar physical make up to humans but use them differently to make distinct sounds?,"I am no expert but I do know the *size* of the larynx/pharynx affects the sound a lot. It's the reason male and female voices sound different.
