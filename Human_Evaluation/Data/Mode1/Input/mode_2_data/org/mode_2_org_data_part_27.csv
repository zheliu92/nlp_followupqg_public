3265,ELI5 Why do we get dehydrated while flying?,"It's dry air sucked in from the outside, which is very cold, and very dry (-40 <1% humidity), and when you heat cold dry air, you get warm even dryer air. Depending on the age of the aircraft it is either engine bleed air, or outside air pulled in and compressed, or a mix of the two. Both are very dry. The humidity from people breathing helps moisten the air up and it's more comfortable if the air is recirculated in the cabin as it keeps the air a little more humid.   It's also much lower pressure (Usually equivalent of 6000 to 7000 feet) at cruising altitude inside of the aircraft. Lower pressure reduces the boiling point of water and increases the rate it evaporates. The lower the air pressure, the lower the vapor pressure and the more easily water boils and evaporates. This is why food often has high altitude instructions that require you to cook it longer because the food doesn't get as hot because the boiling point is lower. Water can never get hotter than the boiling point so lower boiling point, lower temp, longer cook.   Really though most of what happens is not dehydration, it's just drying of the mouth, sinuses, and throat, which prompts the body to feel thirsty.","Interesting, is there a way for the body to get used to the dry air and “adapt” according?

It is intentionally kept that way to minimize the effects of corrosion on the metal parts within the fuselage.    This is a misconception.  The air inside the plane has a high humidity.  It is actually quite the opposite.  When the cabin is completely dry, the air inside is extremely warm.  This happens because of the lack of air conditioning.  Also, the humidity inside the cabin can be very high.  If you have a humid room, you can get very dehydrated.  But if you have an air conditioner, you are fine.  And if you don't have a condenser, you don`t get very thirsty.  So, the question is, why do we get dehydrated?"

You stop a red light with brakes, you're not going anywhere, your engine is still on and running so when you decide to move again it will do so.    This is a bit of a stretch, but I think it's a bit more accurate.  The operating system is constantly running, so if it stops, it doesn't have processes running.  But if it starts, it has processes running, and if it doesn’t, it stops.  So if it stopped, it wouldn’ t have processes.  And if it started, it would have processes that would run, and wouldn‘t have interrupts.  This would mean that if the computer stopped, there would be no process running, no interrupt.  That’s why I think the term idle is a little misleading.  It’d be more accurate to say that the computer is just sitting idle, waiting for something to happen.  If it starts up, it will run, but if it sits idle for a while, it won’T.  Because it’ll have processes working, and those processes are not running."
