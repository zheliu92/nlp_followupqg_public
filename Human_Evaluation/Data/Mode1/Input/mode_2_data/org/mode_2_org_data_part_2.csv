3010,"Eli5 how headphones with 40mm drivers reproduce low bass notes convincingly, but it takes a very large loudspeaker driver to reproduce bass notes?","A small driver can reproduce low frequencies/long wavelengths as long as your ear is less than one wavelength (or half a wavelength?) from the driver.  Beyond that, you need large drivers. I'm not sure what the rule is that relates the diameter of the driver to the length of the wavelength it can send. For reference, 1 meter is the wavelength of 343 Hz","So, a larger driver can project a lower frequency further at the same volume?",Related,"I'm not sure what the rule is that relates the diameter of the driver to the length of the wavelength it can send.    I've heard of headphones with 40mm drivers that reproduce low bass notes convincingly, but it seems to me that a 40mm driver would be much more powerful for the same reason.  I'm not really sure what you mean by that, but I'm curious."

3012,ELI5: Why are planes not getting faster?,"As a sidebar to the main answer, it may seem like passenger aircraft haven’t changed much in 60 years: same basic shape, similar speed.  But there’s one huge advance that isn’t obvious: fuel efficiency.  Today’s aircraft are **10 times more fuel efficient** than they were in the 1950s, in terms of fuel used per passenger per km.  This has been achieved through bigger planes with more seats, but mostly through phenomenal improvements in engine technology.

This is a bit of a stretch, but it’ll get you through the next few decades.  The fuel saved per passenger is a direct result of the increased efficiency of the engines.  So, if you can imagine a plane flying at 100% efficiency, you can probably get there in about 60 years.  But if you take a plane that uses 100% fuel efficiency, and you take it out on a cruise, you still need about the same fuel to get there.  And that's assuming you have a fuel tank that can hold the same amount of fuel."

3013,ELI5: Why are planes not getting faster?,The short version is nobody cares about going faster.  Jet engines and planes have improved tremendously in efficiency.  In the last 60 years the average fuel burn dropped over 45%.which is an insane improvement.   And less fuel is cheaper flights and more profit.,"And perhaps the biggest cause of that fuel burn decrease is the switch from turbojet engines to turbofans. A modern turbofan has very much in common with a turboprop, in that 90% of the thrust is generated by the fan in the front of the engine (pretty much a propeller with 20-30(?) blades). This is what makes modern jet engines so wide in comparison to their slender cousins from the 60s",Related,">In the last 60 years the average burn dropped over 45%.which is an insane improvement.   How did this happen?    The answer is that technology has improved so much that the burning of fuel has decreased so much, that the amount of fuel burned has dropped so much the burning efficiency of fuel no longer matters.  The burning of fuels has dropped by so much because of the efficiency of the fuel used, that it no longer makes sense to burn more fuel.  So why isn't it burning more?"

3014,ELI5: Why are planes not getting faster?,Another point is that the benefit for increased speed is marginal when typical flights aren’t all that long to begin with and when a good portion of the time of the flight is due to air traffic control issues and on-the-ground taxiing at the airport. I remember my dad (who worked for a major airline) commenting about how flights to Southern California took 45 minutes longer than when he started even though the planes were faster — all due to traffic and airport issues.,Arrive 2+ hours before your one-hour flight to allow time for security checks... ok. Allow 1+ hours for that layover in a major metro in case the first leg runs late. So who cares if a new plane could save six minutes in the air? There is 100x more time to be saved on airports and aircraft that are apparently just too dense for the public to use safely or for operators to put on direct routes even once a day.

3018,eli5: Why are the oceans salty?,"Salt is a mineral which can dissolve in water. The water cycle has water evaporating from the oceans and falling onto the land, running back into the oceans eventually. When the water evaporates from the oceans it doesn't take salt with it so what is falling onto the land is fresh water. But as it runs over the rocks and minerals on the land some of the salt will dissolve and go with the rainwater down through streams, rivers, and eventually into the ocean.  Over a long time this means salt tends to move into the ocean, making it salty.",So the ocean is getting saltier?  Edit: it does,Slightly Related,>Salt is a mineral which can dissolve in water.  So what happens to the salt that is dissolved in the water when it is evaporated?
3018,eli5: Why are the oceans salty?,"Salt is a mineral which can dissolve in water. The water cycle has water evaporating from the oceans and falling onto the land, running back into the oceans eventually. When the water evaporates from the oceans it doesn't take salt with it so what is falling onto the land is fresh water. But as it runs over the rocks and minerals on the land some of the salt will dissolve and go with the rainwater down through streams, rivers, and eventually into the ocean.

What might be a past event for person A might be in the present for person B and might be in the future of person C. And there is no ""correct"" perspective - to each of them that same event has a different ""now-ness"" to it. So past, present and future events are simply constructs of our individual experience of events happening in time.","This is baffling to me, i'm not doubting you, i just understand it.

I think I understand now.  If I understand correctly, the distinction between past and future is a construct of our minds.  We have no absolute time.  In fact, we have no objective objective measure of time. We can only measure our subjective experience of time, and that is subjective.
