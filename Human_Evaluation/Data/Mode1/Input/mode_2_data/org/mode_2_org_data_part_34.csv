3330,ELI5: How can film tape hold so much information?,"As others have mentioned, film is analog which means the color 'data,' is stored physically on each grain of the film. Since these grains are super tiny (far tinier than the pixels on a screen) we can get really high resolutions from them before they start to become blurry.  Also ""tiny memory card,"" vs ""tiny flat frame of film,"" is also not quite a fair comparison since:  * A digital film will be compressed. This means throwing away some of the data/detail in order to save on file size. An uncompressed 4k movie would be hundreds of GB (if not more). There's no such thing as ""compressing,"" film, so we get all the detail captured by the camera basically for free. * An entire IMAX film isn't just a single frame of film. It's a reel about the size of a table which is WAY larger than a memory card. * While a memory card might be made of billions of transistors, each *frame* on a strip is made of billions of grains. Similarly while each transistor can store either a 1 or a 0, we need many 1s and 0s just to represent a single pixel, while a single grain on film can ""store,"" an entire color completely on it's own.  This is of course only scratching the surface, but if you'd like more info I'd be happy to elaborate on anything.","It's the concept of the ""grain"" that's unfimiliar to me.

During their final moments - and in particular during the collisions of neutron stars - they *do* produce very heavy elements (although I don't think it's known whether they produce all the way to 118 or beyond). During the [r-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process), stars run up the line of nuclei that can juuuuust barely take another neutron. These nuclei are already phenomenally unstable and may include some we can't produce here on Earth yet because we have no mechanism to bombard them with neutrons that fast. But they decay almost immediately.",Oh okay. I thought that the sun only fused hydrogen into helium because there wasn't enough helium in the sun of it to collide with other helium particles and fuse into new elements. So the heliums just bounce off each other? And what is the temperature needed to fuse helium?,Slightly Related,But what about when stars are just dying?
3336,ELI5: Why do we prune most of what we learn from our memory?
