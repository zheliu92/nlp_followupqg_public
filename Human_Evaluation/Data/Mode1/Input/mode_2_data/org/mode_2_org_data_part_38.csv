3372,"ELI5: What exactly is alcohol, and why does it kill basically everything?",Alcohol is a family of chemicals determined by having and alcohol group attached (R-OH) these kill organisms a few different ways. The most obvious is that in high concentrations it will pull water out of cells in the same way salt does. This isn’t the most significant however. Because the oxygen has two lone pairs on it these lone pairs can attack organic molecules in the organism/virus disrupting metabolic processes or outright destroying cell components. Further depending on the alcohol it can just dissolve cell parts. Recognize not all alcohols are equal. For example humans can consume a shocking amount of ethanol and be okay but even half as much isopropanol will kill you twice over.,So when I have too much to drink it's a big R-OH R-OH?,Related,So isopropanol the same as ethanol?

It's a hydrocarbon and is a hydroxy alcohol. When you combine ethanol with isopropylamine, you get ethanol.  When you take a large amount of ethanol, you're going to kill yourself.  Is it safe to consume even half a bottle of isoprocanol a day?  Yes, but not in the same way that drinking a bottle a day of regular distilled water will kill me."

3373,"ELI5: What exactly is alcohol, and why does it kill basically everything?","Cell membranes are made from molecules called lipids. These are basically fat molecules that are ordered in a specific way. When these come into contact with alcohol, the alcohol is able to, basically, dissolve the membrane because of how the alcohol and lipids interact. This causes the contents of the cell to leak into the environment, killing the cell. On top of that, the alcohol can also cause proteins to warp in ways that either render them useless or even harmful to the cell.  When it comes to disinfectants, you will likely often see 70% alcohol being used. This is actually for a number of reasons. On an economic level, it's simply cheaper and easier to make. On a disinfectant level, it is good enough, and can even be more effective at dealing with spores because: Having a significant water content increases evaporation time. This means that the alcohol is kept in contact with a surface for longer.",Why doesn't the alcohol destroy too our epiderma cells phospholipids layer?,Related,">When it comes to disinfectants, you will likely often see 70% alcohol being used.

3377,ElI5 : Why is it not possible to rezip a .zip file to make it take even less space ?,"You can, and sometimes re-zipping a zip file will indeed make it smaller. But the way compression works is by removing redundant information, and it reaches a point where there is no redundant information to remove anymore.  For example, suppose your file contains the sequence ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"". You can compress it by replacing the value with ""Ax24"", and when you decompress it, the algorithm will just unpack this value back. Now what happens if you try compressing ""Ax24"" again? Nothing, because there is nothing redundant to compress.","> Now what happens if you try compressing ""Ax24"" again? Nothing, because there is nothing redundant to compress.
