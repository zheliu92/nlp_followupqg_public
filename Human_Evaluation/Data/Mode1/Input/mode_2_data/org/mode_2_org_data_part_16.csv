3150,ELI5: Screaming usually damages your voice and changes the quality of your speaking. How are horror movie actors able to get multiple consistant shots without their voices sounding scratchy or swollen in between scenes?,"The final sound you hear in a movie, especially a scream, has very likely been enhanced or overdubbed in post production.  That’s also when they add the foley effects (sounds of walking, punching, etc).",Wilhelm? Is that you?,Slightly Related,That’s interesting. How do they get the sound to match the actors’ natural pitch?

Is that you?,Slightly Related,">That’s also when they add the foley effects (sounds walking, punching, etc).    I’m not talking about the actual sound effects, but the way they are added to the movie.   For example, in the scene where the girl is getting her heart broken, she’ll be wailing and the sound is added to make it seem like she‘s actually wailing.  This is done to add tension to the scene, and to make the audience feel the pain.  The sound is also added to enhance the actors’ voices.  I think this is the most common thing that happens when they do this.  It’d be like if they added a voice to a song, and then later on, they would have a different vocal style.  But when they did this, they did it for a different kind of song, so it’re not really a song at all.  Also, if you hear a woman scream, it‘ll probably be different than the way you hear her scream in real life."

3151,Eli5 How do propane fridges make cold using flame?,"When ammonia encounters hydrogen gas, the chemical reaction between the two absorbs heat. That's how the propane fridge produces its cooling action -- by pulling heat from the interior of the refrigerator into the ammonia-hydrogen mix. As it absorbs heat, the ammonia becomes a gas again.",Side question - Is that ammonia-hydrogen mix the same process they use in those instant cold packs?,Slightly Related,How does it do that?

3158,ELI5: Can Journalist Interview Wanted Criminals and Fugitives?,We as a sociaty do want journalists to be able to freely talk to criminals so that we can get a fair view of the world we live in. We therefore grant journalists the same rights as doctors and priests to not have to disclose secrets about crimes and criminals. This is so that the criminals can be able to trust these people with secret information. There is of course limits to this right and journalists can not be part of a crime or in a possition where they can prevent the crime from taking place. There may also be more specific laws depending on the legislation.  It does not mean that it is easy for journalists to find criminals to interview.  There is a reason wanted criminals have not been caught. So a journalist might need some time to gain the confidence of the criminal networks they are making a story about. Investigative journalism takes a lot of time because of things like this. You might even see the journalist having to publish whatever they have and first then start to gain the confidence of the people higher up. Trust also goes both ways and the journalist have to make sure that the criminals are who they say they are and that they will not do harm to them. Journalists have been kidnapped or even killed when investigating criminals they trusted. It is also common for journalists to get a lot of information that they can not publish yet because it would be unfair to the criminals involved. So an article or a documentary might have to sit on the shelf for months or even years before it can be published. In order for the criminals to be able to trust the journalist there can not be any information published that the police find useful. Even if there is some useful pieces of information to the police they can not trust that it is accurate since it may be embelished or distorted information at that point.,Thank you.

There is a reason wanted criminals have not been caught. So a journalist might need some time to gain the confidence of the criminal networks they are making a story about. Investigative journalism takes a lot of time because of things like this. You might even see the journalist having to publish whatever they have and first then start to gain the confidence of the people higher up. Trust also goes both ways and the journalist have to make sure that the criminals are who they say they are and that they will not do harm to them. Journalists have been kidnapped or even killed when investigating criminals they trusted. It is also common for journalists to get a lot of information that they can not publish yet because it would be unfair to the criminals involved. So an article or a documentary might have to sit on the shelf for months or even years before it can be published. In order for the criminals to be able to trust the journalist there can not be any information published that the police find useful. Even if there is some useful pieces of information to the police they can not trust that it is accurate since it may be embelished or distorted information at that point.,Thank you.

Humans have a long history of having interests. Humans have been around for thousands of years, and we evolved a long evolutionary history.  We are not a species that was just born with a focus on survival and reproduction.  If we were just a group of hunter-gatherer animals that lived for survival, we would have no interest in play.  But we evolved to be more interested in other things besides survival.  For example, we have a very long history with music, and I'm sure we have many interests outside of just survival."
