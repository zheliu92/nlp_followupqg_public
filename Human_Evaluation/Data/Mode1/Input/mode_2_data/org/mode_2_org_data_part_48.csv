3470,ELI5: Why is there a limited quantity of Ebooks for library systems?,"\[EDIT: Oh wow! My first silver! Thank you, you glorious human! OMG! Two silvers! You people are simply majestic!\]  I work as a Library Tech at a large metropolitan library. My dept does the purchasing and assignment to branches of purchased items - books, ebooks, audiobooks, CDs, DVDs, you name it.  The short answer is that publishers don't sell the electronic items to libraries, they license them with certain conditions; To offer 6 copies for circulation we have to buy 6 licenses, usually at a rate much higher than you could buy it through Amazon. Each of these licenses are single-use, meaning only one check-out at a time is allowed.  But wait! There's more!  Part of the purchase license is a limit to how many times that one licensed ebook can be circulated - and that's often a rather small number. So those 6 copies/licenses, maybe each can only circ 10 times, so really we only get 60 circs out of it. If the ebook is popular and the item keeps getting reserves on it, then we have to keep buying licenses.  Now our regular paper books, which we buy at a price just higher than retail (often reinforced bindings) can circ 20 or more times before they fall apart, so the license model means we pay significantly more per circ.  For us, as a library, and ebook, audiobook, or any other electronic item ISN'T any different that a paper book. We catalog and track them in exactly the same way. Not because it's easier or anything, but because book/item circulation is the most important metric we use in both funding and budget planning.

The ebook licenses are a bit different. Each of these licenses are single-use, meaning only one check-out at a time is allowed.  So how do you track the amount of ebooks that are checked out? Is it a percentage? Is there a limit? Is the number allowed to be checked out a certain number of times?  I'm not sure how to quantify this, but I'm guessing it's something like a percentage of the total circulation."

3471,ELI5: Can somebody explain to me bullet calibers?,"The other two comments nailed the whole metric versus imperial thing, but its actually a fair bit more complex than that. Never fear, I'm your friendly neighborhood gun guy.  ""50 cal"" is a term that most people attribute to .50 BMG, but .50 BMG is definitely not the only .50 caliber cartridge. The reason that most calibers have either a military designation (5.56x45mm, 7.62x39mm) or a word after the caliber designation is because no two calibers are exactly the same.  In the case of x.xx*xx mm, those are military designations, usually NATO. They denote the diameter of the bullet, and the length of the brass case. But for more Imperial calibers, you'll see "".30-06 Springfield,"" "".270 Winchester,"" "".223 Remington,"" ""9mm Parabellum,"" "".45 ACP,"" etc.  The diameter of the bullet is a small part of the equation. For example, there is 9x19mm, aka 9mm Parabellum, or just 9mm. But there are tons of calibers with a 9mm diameter bullet. .380 Auto, .357 Magnum, 9x18 Makarov, 9x39 Soviet, etc. The differences come from case length and design, and powder load. More powder with the same bullet means more force on target.  You would be correct in saying, "".45 ACP is a bigger bullet than 5.56."" But 45 ACP is designed for handguns, and as such has a shorter case and smaller powder load. This helps keep the guns, well, handguns, and helps with controllability under recoil.  There are probably thousands of ""30 cal"" calibers in this world, and they do not all perform the same, and most likely won't fit and fire safely in guns not specifically marked for them.  .50 BMG is probably the largest caliber that you can own without filling out paperwork for a Destructive Device from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Because somebody decided at some point that any firearm with a bore larger than half an inch was essentially a cannon.  When looking at terminal ballistics (how good is this bullet at breaking that thing), you have to take into consideration bullet size, bullet weight, and powder load at a minimum. 9mm has a smaller powder load than 45 ACP, and pushes a smaller bullet (about half the weight) about 30% faster. 5.56 on the other hand, is basically pushing a .22 at 2800-3100 feet per second, around 3x as fast as the 9mm.  What could help you greatly in your understanding is to go on the interwebs and find a picture of a few calibers side by side.

The button look like it is still pressed even after you let go of the mouse, and you can't move the window or press any other control in the interface until the analysis is complete.

In a single-threaded environment, if one instruction takes a long time, it holds up the entire process.  Multithreading gives sets of instructions which can be run in parallel. If you have multiple CPUs or if the CPU has multiple cores, it can give each one its own set of instructions so they can really be done at the same time. Even if not, a single CPU can switch back and forth between multiple threads, making a little progress on one before switching to the other.  A standard example in programming is with the user interface. Say you click on a button that does some sort of long-running analysis. With a single-threaded application, as soon as you push the button, all the tasks used to keep the user interface responsive are held up. The button look like it is still pressed even after you let go of the mouse, and you can't move the window or press any other control in the interface until the analysis is complete. In a multi-threaded environment, the analysis would be put on another thread. It can do its thing while the thread that keeps the user interface responsive does its job as well.","Oh thanks for that real life application! It really helped see some of it's actual uses. When creating programs, do programmers need to structure or write the code in a certain way to take advantage of multithreading? Or can the computer see an opportunity to utilize multithreading and do it by itself?",Strongly Related,"I see, but what about the user interface? Is that not handled by a separate thread?"
