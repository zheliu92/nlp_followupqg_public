The surgeon is hooking up the blood vessels manually.  The patient is already unconscious, so why is the surgeon hooking everything up manually?   Also, if the surgeon is already hooking the blood up, why is it that the brain is still completely unconscious?  The brain is not connected to the body, so it can't be affected by the blood flow.  Also if the patient is unconscious, the surgeon can't perform surgery on the brain, because the brain can't respond to the surgeon's commands.  This makes sense, but I still don't understand why the surgeon has to hook everything up so fast.  If the patient was unconscious, they could have waited for the surgeon to get there and perform surgery.  But if the surgery is already underway, why does the brain have to be so quickly connected?  Because it's not a live organ, it's a dead organ."
