3020,ELI5: Why do car insurance companies charge you more to retain your full right to sue someone?,"Because if you delegate your right to sue for pain and suffering to them, they can negotiate a settlement which is higher than if you did not.

They aren't ""limiting your rights"", they are exercising them as agents of you. But you can't have your agents use them and then try to use them yourself.","When selecting a policy, it gives two options of either limit the right or full right.

Could we not delegate them that right?",Related,">They aren't ""limiting your rights"", they are exercising them as agents of you.

3024,Eli5: What's that sharp pain in your abdomen when you start running suddenly?,"There's a lot of controversy over what causes a side stitch. I've studied it over the years and with well over 200,000 running miles I have plenty of experience. For me, a side stitch comes about from stomach muscles not being synchronized with breathing. Think of it as your chest muscles pulling up as your abdominal muscles pull down. I'm sure that's not technically correct, but that's the effect you experience when the muscles are strained. It can be eliminated/reduced by concentrating on breathing on one side or the other, generally your dominant side. When that foot strikes the ground, you want to be exhaling. Focusing on this will help synchronize the muscles and stop the stitch. There are other causes that increase the likelihood of stitches such as dehydration or stress.","But if power through the pain without changing anything, it just goes away after 5 mins or so for me.

3027,ELI5 How does sound wave energy get converted into electricity and why is it less efficient than solar energy?,"The microphone reflects *a lot* of the sound energy that hits it.  Your simple microphone is like a tiny speaker in reverse where sound hits the diaphragm (little movable plate) and pushes a magnet in and out of a coil of wire.  This little diaphragm is hard on the surface which means that a lot of the sound energy hits it and bounces off rather than being absorbed in pushing the magnet through the coil.  There are little capacitor based ones but the magnet setup is easiest to understand as a reversed speaker.  Solar panels on the other hand are very absorbant of the frequencies they work with.  Some percentage is reflected off the top glass layer but 90% of the light will pass through and then be absorbed down below.  The efficiency of solar panels mostly comes down to the sun emitting light over a wide range of frequencies and our little solar panels only being able to absorb a small range of frequencies which is why the best case efficiency of a single junction solar panel is just 37% because that's the bigger window we can make in the highest energy portion of the sun's spectrum.  Another issue with capturing sound energy is that there just really isn't all that much of it.  If you were to stand 1 meter away from a jet engine its sound level is around 150 dB, but if you were to capture *all* the sound energy from that jet engine it'd be around 1000 W, a 150 dB sound only gives you 1000 W of energy to work with.  You can get that much energy with about 5 m^2 of solar panels and you won't have a giant turbofan engine screaming away in the background.","Gotcha, that makes a lot of sense! So it's a combination of inefficient sound capturing (would need a VERY sensitive diaphragm) and the general low dBs that could be captured.. Would there be some sort of way to boost the dB frequency just before it reaches the diaphragm yet contain it in a way that doesn't actually (noise) pollute the surrounding area? Also is there any possibility to leverage a sort of ""gear reduction"" (obviously not gears themselves, but the principle of reduced effort or whatever) that could amplify the dB level? Could that be achieved after it's converted?",Slightly Related,>Solar panels on the other hand are very absorbant of the frequencies they work with.  So how does that work?

I know that the CIE uses a formula that is used to estimate the C-redshift of light, but what exactly does that mean?   For example, if I have a red light and a green light, how does the green light distort the red light?  I'm guessing that the answer is that the green and blue wavelengths distort the green, and that the red and blue are not affected by the distortion.
