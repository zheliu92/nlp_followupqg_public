If there is just one or the other they may clone them and then use a similar species to place in the womb for gestation. Like if you had a special type of monkey that was going extinct they could take the egg and sperm from those monkeys and create an embryo then implant it into a different species of monkey so they don’t risk one of the endangered monkeys from dying in birth. They can do this many many times simultaneously to create a whole bunch of new ones.,So they breed it with another type?

3138,ELI5: How can cockroaches be resistant to nuclear radiation if their body parts are made from DNA?,"A *decent* analogy is theme to the bladerunner short, 'Blackout 2022':  The replicants know they need to destroy the database that stores all of their names and personal information, while simultaneously blowing up the facility that backs up that information (in case something happens to the first facility). However, there's only a small window in-time in which it's possible to destroy both (when the cockroach molts).  There's 2 strands of DNA and one of those strands can fix the other if it takes damage; just think of the cockroach as always being able to back up the first strain when you damage it, but when it's molting the strands separate temporarily, and could both be damaged simultaneously, with no backups.
