3460,eli5:How does sunscreen/sunblock/suntan lotion stop you from getting burned?,Answer:  there are two main methods.  First there’s the physical barrier of the layer of chemicals over the skin.  Zinc or titanium are the main ingredients that create a physical barrier between your skin and the suns rays. Next there are chemical sunscreens.  These chemicals bind with the UVA and UVB rays  and create a reaction that releases this energy without it affecting the skins cells.,So lotion must make you hotter then? The energy has to go somewhere?,Related,"> First there’s the physical barrier of chemicals over the skin.   This is what we call a “skin tight” layer.  This layer is made of a chemical called a ”skin tightener”.  It is made up of a mixture of moisturising oils, which act as a barrier, and moisturising creams, which are also made of chemicals.  The moisturising ingredients act as an absorbent layer that absorbs the sun’ rays.  These chemicals bind with the UVA and UVB rays  and create a reaction that releases this reaction without it affecting the skins cells    The same goes for the moisturising lotion.  So, if you rub your face with a moisturising sunscreen, it absorbs the UVB and UVA rays, but it doesn’t do anything to your hair, your eyes, your mouth, or your hairline.  If you rub it on your face, it will absorb the UAV and UVBs, but not your hair.  And if you apply it on the other hand, it does damage your hair and your face."

3461,"ELI5: If lightning takes the shortest path to the ground, why is it all jagged-like in the sky, and not a straight line?","How a lightning bolt (or any electric arc) forms:  1. Two opposite charge distributions build up in the clouds and ground, creating a voltage between the two and therefor an electric field distributed in the space between them.  2. In some area, usually near a sharp point in one of the charge distributions, the electric field exceeds the breakdown strength of air, stripping electrons from the air molecules and causing that area to become conductive.  3. Charge from the charge distribution flows into this area until it is at the same voltage. That small patch of volume is now a conductive extension of the charge distribution.  4. There is now the same voltage between the two charge distributions, and at a slightly smaller distance, further concentrating the electric field between the two, which will lead to further breakdown of the air.  5. This process repeats continuously until a full conductive path of ionized air is created between the charge distributions. At which point the entirety of the charge will flow and the two opposite charge distributions will neutralize each other. As the charge is depleted, the electric field will weaken, and no new paths will be formed, first path to ground wins.  So why is the path jagged?  If you took two metal plates, one at 0v and one at 12v, there would be an electric field evenly distributed between them. Now if you took a third plate at 0v and put it between the other two, the electric field would be concentrated between the middle plate and the 12v plate, the presence of the middle plate has deprived the outer 0v plate of its surrounding electric field.  It works similarly in lightning, streamers lower to the ground will block the progress of streamers above, streamers to the sides of other streamers will tend to redirect them away. Each one at any instant will progress in the direction of the strongest electric field, and they will influence each other’s electric fields to point away from each other.  The geometry of the charge distributions and the shape of the streamers at any instant during the process will ultimately determine the path of lightning.  The “path of least resistance” explanation is not true and this isn’t even rigorously well defined when you think about it. The charge distributions will build up along the surfaces facing each other, you could pick two points on these surfaces and find the path between them which has the smallest line integral of resistivity along it. But which two points? The answer will be different for different points. And the resistivity of the various sections of air is dynamically changing as the conductive path is being formed, so the path of least resistance is constantly changing too. Not to mention the resistivity of air should only be dependent on its temperature, pressure and humidity which will not vary so much for neighboring patches of air, so you wouldn’t expect such a jagged path if it was truly resistance driving the process. It would be a straight line or have a slight but smooth curve to account for the changing pressure, temperature and humidity as a function of altitude.  So it’s not the path of least resistance, it’s a complex result of the instantaneous geometry of the charge distributions and current locations of the other streamers which will guide a streamer in one direction or the other. I don’t think there is a simple way to characterize the path which lightning will ultimately take in any given situation.","So the streamers are being guided by the charge distributions, which keeps changing.  Or in other words, takes the path of least electrical resistance.  It sounded like you were literally explaining the path of least resistance, but then said ""path of least resistance is wrong""?",Related,"I see, thanks. So if lightning takes the shortest path to the ground, why is it all jagged-like in the sky, and not a straight line. Is it because of the lack of resistance?"

3468,ELI5: How does light travel in space?,"Sound is what happens when the particles in a material push against each other in a wave. Honestly, it’s very similar to just waves you would see in the ocean. Particles bunch up into a wave, and then spread out between the waves.   Light on the other hand, is what happens when the electromagnetic field oscillates.   To explain that a bit more, imagine a magnet. When you hold the magnet near a piece of iron, the iron will get pulled towards the magnet. The strength of the pull depends on how far away the magnet is though. If the magnet is basically touching the iron, it gets pulled really hard, but if the magnet is on the other side of the room, it hardly pulls the iron at all.   That “pull” is analogous to the magnetic field. When the iron is being pulled strongly, the magnetic field put out by the magnet is strong at the iron’s location. When the iron is hardly being pulled, the magnetic field is pretty weak. As a disclaimer, this isn’t a completely accurate way to picture the magnetic field, since it also has a direction, but it’s close enough.   Now, that “pull” doesn’t have to travel through any matter. It’s not like the magnet is sending a pulse through the air telling the iron to come towards it. The magnetic field fills up all of “empty” space, so a magnet could pull iron even in empty space, without any air.   Now, another thing to understand is that the magnetic field, what we were just talking about, and the electric field, which makes charged particles attract/repel each other, are connected. The important bit here is that when a magnetic field changes, it causes the electric field nearby to change as well.   That means that if you cause a change in the magnetic field, say by moving a magnet away, that change will cause a pulse in the electric field.   Where it gets weird is that changes in the electric field do the same thing. When you change the electric field, it will cause a magnetic field to appear.   So, let’s say you move a magnet away quickly. That will cause the magnetic field in the area to drop off suddenly. That change in the magnetic field will make a pulse in the electric field just ahead of it. But now, if the electric field just pulsed, that means it changed, and a changing electric field causes a magnetic field. So that pulse in the electric field causes its own pulse in the magnetic field just ahead. Again though, the magnetic field just changed, so you get an electric pulse. The electric pulse causes a magnetic pulse, which causes an electric pulse, which causes a magnetic pulse, which causes…  Anyway, you can see how that makes a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields propagate along through space.   Btw, wiggling a magnet does actually make light, but you can’t wiggle it fast enough to make visible light, sadly. You can make some really low energy radio waves though!  **TL;DR** *Light isn’t a matter wave, it’s an electromagnetic wave that propagates through electric and magnetic fields. “Empty” space isn’t actually empty, and it still has those fields in it, so light can wiggle its way through those fields to travel in space*","Very interesting, thank you for the detailed response.
