3404,ELI5: How do we know the universe is constantly expanding?,"Have you ever heard a train horn or siren get higher-pitched as it approached then lower-pitched as it went by? Well, that's the Doppler effect.  What's happening there is that the sound gets compressed, making it sound higher-pitched, as the thing making it moves towards you and stretching the sound, making it sound lower-pitched, as it moves away. [Here’s a cute little animation from Wikipedia.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/Dopplerfrequenz.gif)  Light works the same way, but it turns bluer when compressed and redder when stretched. This is called redshift. When we look out into space, pretty much everything is redshifting. While I suppose it’s possible this is due to galaxies trying to clear the room after sniffing the cosmic fart that is humanity, it’s more likely that the galaxies are just spreading out to fill extra room.","You lose me at ""everything is red shifting"", so everything has red light waves?",Related,"Thanks for the answer!

Well, that's the Doppler effect.   It's a bit of a paradox, but it's actually quite simple. When you hear a train whistle, it's usually the same sound as when you're watching it on TV, but the sound is compressed as it travels towards you, so it's making it sound higher-sounding as it goes along. When the train goes away, it'll be the same as if it were traveling at normal speed, but because it's moving away, its sound will be different.  This is called redshift.  It happens when we look out into space and see a galaxy, and it's called the Doppelfrequenz.  The reason it happens is because the light is moving away from us, and the light molecules are moving away with it. So the light in the universe is stretching, and that's why it's redshifting.  If you hear the sound of a train, it will be the exact same as when it's coming towards you. But if you hear it going away, you'll notice that it's not quite as loud.  That's because the sound waves are moving apart, and so the sound isn't traveling at the same speed as it was before.  So the sound you're hearing is actually coming from a different part of the universe, and as it moves away, the sound gets different."

3406,ELI5: What does it mean when people say that a country is in debt?,"If the US refused to pay back the money it owes then it would lower the US's credit rating.  This would mean that the US would have to borrow money at a higher interest rate (countries generally borrow money by issuing bonds and asking people, countries, organisations, etc to buy them with the promise of routine interest payments and then at a set date paying the bond off).  This could mean that people, organisations and countries would be cautious of lending the US money as the US has shown that it doesn't pay it back.  However, higher interest rates would mean that the US would have to pay more money back and that might entice some to lend.    Having debt in itself isn't bad for a country.

3409,"ELI5: How does electrical ""draw"" work? How does the circuit know how much energy the devices plugged into it need?","That's what electrical engineers are for.  Voltage pushes the electrons through the wire. If you run a direct wire between the live and ground prongs of your outlet, there is little to impede their flow and you get a flood of electrons - breakers in your house shut off power when this happens.  Devices limit their current draw in different ways. Basic resistive components have a resistance - they are highly imperfect conductors and so electrons encounter a lot of resistance as they try to move. This hinders the flow. One of the most basic equations you'll find in electronics is V=IR, which describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.  Other devices may use inductive or capacitive limits - AC power is constantly trying to change, and these components can limit it by either requiring or resisting change - unlike a resistor these do not turn energy into heat and so are more efficient.  More modern supplies switch on and off. By switching on and off faster or slower, we can limit how much power flows through without bulky capacitors or inductors and without the waste of resistors. Semiconductor technology has made this solution very cheap.  There are many more methods, but that's the basics.","This is a helpful answer, thanks.

This is a misconception.  Current is a direct voltage.  The problem is that when you put a direct current (say 5V) through a resistor, the resistance decreases. This hinders the flow.  So how does the circuit know how much current it needs?    The answer is that it measures the resistance of the wire and then calculates the current flow through the device.  This can be done by measuring the resistance and the current current through the resistor, or by measuring how fast the current is flowing through the circuit.  If the resistor is too low, then the device will not be able to handle the current.  But if the resistor has a resistance of 100V, then how does it know how fast it is flowing?  The answers to these questions are in the equations that describe the electrical field and how it works.  They are not necessarily the same as the equations describing the electrical conductance."
