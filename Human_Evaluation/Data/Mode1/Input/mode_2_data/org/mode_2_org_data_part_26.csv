3250,"Eli5 If I toss a ball while on a motorcycle, would it land on my hand or would it drop?","In a perfect vacuum, if you threw the ball up by tossing it up in the palm of your hand, it would keep moving forward with you and return to your  palm perfectly.  You can duplicate this effect in an evironment with an enclosed atmosphere, like a bus or a train or a car.  A motorcycle, however, does not have an enclosed atmosphere and cannot be ridden in a vacuum (internal combustion engines need oxygen).  So on a motorcycle, the ball will be hit by the molecules of the air, which is moving slower than the motorcycle, and it will slow down in the horizontal direction, and fall behind your hand.","So, if i toss a ball(say a tennis ball) on a moving motorcycle at point A then by the time the ball comes down I would have moved to point so it'll probably fall on the ground, since i have moved??",Related,">In a perfect vacuum, if you threw the ball up by tossing it up in the palm of your hand, it would keep moving forward with you and return to your  palm perfectly.

3251,Eli5 What is the difference between a contusion (bruise) and an ecchymosis?,"They are not quite interchangeable.  Ecchymosis is discoloration of the skin resulting from bleeding underneath, usually from a bruise but not always. Specifically it refers to the skin discoloration not the underlying cause.  A contusion is when an injured blood vessel or capillaries leak blood into the surrounding tissue. This is the underlying condition, not the surface appearance.  So you see ecchymosis to diagnose a contusion, but they are not the same thing.",So the ecchymosis is the sign while the contusion is the symptom?,Strongly Related,What is an ecchymosis?

3252,Eli5: Edible plants and fungi. I assume we used to determine if a food was edible by trial and error for most of the past. How would we determine newly discovered food edible today without jeopardizing health or life?,"The same process still applies, many survivalists have it memorized and use it in the field. It's called the Universal Edibility Test. It's a several step process that takes most of the day to accomplish.  First, you seperate out the various parts. You need to test roots, leaves, stems, buds, and flowers independently, because sometimes one part will be poisonous while another isn't.   You give each bit a good smell. Strong and unpleasant odors are usually a bad sign, and if you're in the field you'll just generally discard them without further testing.   You test for contact poisoning by placing a tiny piece on your wrist for just a moment. If it burns, itches, numbs, or breaks into a rash, you just discard it.  Then you boil each bit individually. Test each piece by briefly touching it to your lips, and then waiting 15-30 minutes to see if anything happens. After that, you can take a small piece into your mouth, chew a couple of times, and hold it in your mouth for 15-30 minutes to see if anything happens. If it's bitter or soapy, you just discard it.  If there's no reaction at all, swallow it and wait the rest of the day. If there's no ill effect after several hours, you can assume this part of the plant is edible. Repeat the process for each individual part of the plant. Many plants have both edible and inedible parts to them, so this can take several days.     As far as fungi goes... just don't. If you're in the field and you can't determine the exact species of mushroom you're looking at with 100% accuracy, don't touch it, don't eat it, just leave it alone. There are many kinds of mushrooms that are edible in one circumstance, but poisonous in another. Hen mushrooms are safe, but if they're growing on a conifer or cedar tree, they're poisonous.  There are scientific tests you can do on mushrooms to determine their exact chemical components and identify if any of them are poisonous, or if they combine to create something poisonous, but if you're out in the woods it's a better idea to just leave them alone.","Thank you for the detailed response.

Early modern humans in Europe were dark skinned but blue eyes came along earlier than skin color became the very pale color that exists now, so you might see a blue eyed person with darker skin, an unusual combination today.   One change in the past 10,000 years is teeth. Ancient humans had an edge-to-edge bite. Front teeth, top and bottom, met at the edge. Nowadays almost everyone has the front upper teeth be in front of the lower front teeth, overlapping a bit. But ancient modern humans would use front teeth to bite down on meat and tear pieces off, pulling the incisors into alignment. They also had perfect teeth for the most part, with more muscular jaws, and that would affect their appearance. They wouldn’t have most of the diseases of modern life such as nearsightedness, tooth decay, acne, etc. they lived in small groups so many of the diseases of high density living didn’t exist or seldom happened, like measles, smallpox, sexually transmitted infections, maybe colds and flu.   Archaic Homo sapiens, meaning people pretty far back on that timeline you give, like 100,000-200,000 years ago, might have had more differences in appearance—they’d be more robust, bigger muscles, thicker brow ridges, less prominent chin.

The energy source for muscles is a specific chemical ""fuel"" in your body called ATP, muscles can only use that and nothing else.  However, while the ATP is the energy source, your brain has to control the muscles somehow, and it does that - simplifying here - by sending electric impulses along your nerves. If you touch an electric cable, the electricity will cause havoc with this communications system - your muscles believe that they're given random, frantic orders, and act accordingly.
