3361,ELI5: Is fungi in the air everywhere? How does mold just on appear out of nowhere on something that sits in your house if there's moisture? How does mold and fungi work?,"Mold spores are ubiquitous - they are pretty much everywhere.  Normal indoor spore count ranges from 500 to 5,000 spores per cubic meter, and outdoor spore counts can be as much as 50,000 spores per cubic meter in summer and fall in many areas.  Moldy buildings can have much higher spore counts, sometimes as high as 500,000 spores per cubic meter.

How does mold and fungi work?,"Intense heat or intense cold can shock mold spores to sprout mycelium. After Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the cities turned pink with aspergillus from the spores that were heat shocked by the firestorm and blast (and yes, some spores did survive the atomic blast). Taking room temp food covered with spores (think strawberries) and putting them in the fridge cold shocks the spores in to action too. The spores are everywhere ALL THE TIME.

3366,Eli5: Can’t we just send our trash into the sun?,"It's not a terrible question, but you have to understand that it's really hard to get things out of earth's gravity.  Imagine lifting a garbage truck into space.   Space is only about 100 km away, but lifting things this far takes a huge amount of energy.  The equation for how much energy is simple, just mass (in grams) times the gravitational acceleration (10 m/s^(2)) times height in meters.  So if you want to lift a ton of garbage to space, you're looking at 1,000,000 g x 10 m/s^(2) x 100,000 meters = 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion) Joules of energy.  If we translate that into food, that becomes 239,000,000 kilocalories (same as dietary calories)  Basically this is the amount of energy used by about 120,000 humans in a day.  Or, put another way, 1 trillion joules is the amount of energy stored in 70 million aa batteries.  Now this is a simplification to get across the immense amounts of energy needed to get anything to space.

I know that is a lot of energy but how much would it take to get it to the sun?"
3366,Eli5: Can’t we just send our trash into the sun?,"It's not a terrible question, but you have to understand that it's really hard to get things out of earth's gravity.  Imagine lifting a garbage truck into space.   Space is only about 100 km away, but lifting things this far takes a huge amount of energy.  The equation for how much energy is simple, just mass (in grams) times the gravitational acceleration (10 m/s^(2)) times height in meters.  So if you want to lift a ton of garbage to space, you're looking at 1,000,000 g x 10 m/s^(2) x 100,000 meters = 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion) Joules of energy.  If we translate that into food, that becomes 239,000,000 kilocalories (same as dietary calories)  Basically this is the amount of energy used by about 120,000 humans in a day.  Or, put another way, 1 trillion joules is the amount of energy stored in 70 million aa batteries.  Now this is a simplification to get across the immense amounts of energy needed to get anything to space.  The actual energy requirements to get to the sun are much higher than this.","I see, then it would be even worse for us right? All that fuel would cause way more pollution? Would it be possible to convert some of that trash into fuel? Or some type of special fuel is required?",Strongly Related,"So basically, if we could just send a ton of garbage into space, it would be cheaper than sending a human?"

3367,ELI5: Why do trees lose their leaves every fall?,"Because leaves are thin and vulnerable. They will cool down well below freezing in cold climates, causing ice crystals to form in their cells, which will rupture the cell membranes and cause damage, killing the leaf.  So if the leaf is going to die anyway, a better option is to recover all the valuable nutrients from it, then detaching it so it’s death doesn’t harm the rest of the tree.  This is what causes the colour change before the leaves fall.",So basically the tree is sucking all the nutrients off the leaves before the leaves fall?,Strongly Related,"So if the tree is going to die anyway, a better option is to recover all the valuable nutrients from it, then detaching it so it’s death doesn’t harm the rest of the tree?"

3368,Eli5: how does reducing current reduce energy loss?,"P does in fact equal IV. You have that right.  What you're missing is that I and V in that equation can't vary independently if the circuit itself is fixed. Since V = IR, and R is fixed, reducing the current necessarily means reducing the voltage. If you, say, halve the current, then you also halve the voltage, which means your new power loss is (1/2 \* original current)(1/2 \* original voltage) = 1/4 the original power loss, just as the formula I^(2)R would suggest.  Or, if you prefer to not fix resistance, changing the resistance changes (because of V = IR) at least one of I or V as well.","Another thing that popped up, how is the electrical power formula VI if the energy lost is also VI?  There's no way all the electrical power is lost through heat right?",Related,"> If you, say, halve the current, then you also halve voltage, which means your new power loss is (1/2 \* original current)(1/4 \* current) = 1/4 the original power loss  Is that correct?"
