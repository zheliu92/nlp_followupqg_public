3059,ELI5: Orange lies between red and yellow on the spectrum and can be made by mixing red and yellow pigments. Then how come violet can be made by mixing red and blue even though it doesn't lie between them on the spectrum?,"It’s a continuous wheel. After violet it goes back to red, so blue coming before violet and red coming after means that combining them will make violet or purple.",Is there a reason why our eyes/brain work that way even though the actual wavelengths themselves are not a continuous loop?,Related,"Thanks for the answer! So if I understand correctly, violet is a continuous wheel. After violet it goes back to red, so blue coming before violet and red coming after means that combining them will make violet or purple?"
