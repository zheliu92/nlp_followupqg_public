3340,ELI5: How do Netflix and its shows earn money?,Netflix has enough customers to cover the costs and on top of that. They have partnerships with brands to promote products in the shows.  Traditional TV earns money by selling advertising time so brands display/promote products,"How many customer do you think they have, 10 million maybe?",Related,But what about the shows that don’t get picked up by a streaming service?

3341,ELI5 What makes Inductors and Capacitors important for radio?,"Capacitors have high impedance at low frequencies, and low impedance at high frequencies. Inductors are the opposite. Low impedance at low frequencies, and high impedance at high frequencies. And impedance basically means frequency dependent resistance. So, one thing you can do is use a capacitor to drive high frequencies into the ground, and inductor to do the same for low frequencies. Boom, that's a band-pass filter. That's pretty useful for radio applications, since you probably don't want to be listening all the frequencies at the same time.  Now for radios, a tuning capacitor is certainly used to control the internal mixing frequency, but that works just the same for incoming and outgoing signals. I'm not se sure if a variable inductor for transmitting was ever a thing.","Thank you, that's a great explanation, so inductors for transmitting are fixed?",Related,">Now for radios, a tuning capacitor is certainly used to control the internal mixing frequency, but that works just the same for incoming and outgoing signals.   I'm not se sure if a variable inductor for transmitting was ever a thing.  I've heard of variable inductors being used for TV sets, but I'm still not sure if they were used for radio.

I'm not sure what you mean by that.  I've never heard of the term 'dragee' before.  It's a marketing term for a sugar-free gum that contains a sugar substitute that dissolves the taste after 20 seconds.   I think it's more like 'drag-chew' or 'drags-cough-out'.

3346,ELI5: How does sniffing glue and sharpies make you high?,"Permanent and rubber cement contain solvents such as toluene, acetone, or xylene which are volatile liquids at room temperature which means they can easily be absorbed by the lungs, pass through capillaries, and quickly enter the bloodstream.  Since they’re small molecules, they can often pass the blood-brain barrier as well.   In the brain, these volatile solvents interfere with nerve signaling pathways (such as NDMA, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, GABA, etc) which produce the immediate “high” when they affect certain areas associated with pleasure response, but also the side effects (headache, nausea, etc).  Long-term use of solvents can actually cause permanent damage to these nerves through build up of high-concentrations and destruction of myelin.   Other inhalants—such as nitrous oxide—work similarly by temporarily interfering with cell receptors, but long-term deplete essential cofactor vitamins such as B12, which is also necessary for nerve function.

Long-term use of solvants can actually cause permanent damage to these nerves through build up high-concentrations and destruction of myelin.    This is a misconception, as acetone is not a volatile solvent.  It is a hydrocarbon, and when heated, it dissolves into a liquid that can be absorbed by the lungs.  However, when cooled, it can become a gas that can get into the bloodstream and cause further problems.  This happens when we use acetone to make glue, or when we rub our mouths with it.  The problem is that acetone can get absorbed through the nose and throat, and the smell is not pleasant.  So when we lick our mouths, we are actually creating a chemical reaction with acetone that causes us to feel high, but the smell isn't pleasant. This is why acetone and toluene are not good for you."

Since they’re small molecules, they can often pass the blood-brain barrier as well.   In the brain, these volatile solvents interfere with nerve signaling pathways (such as NDMA, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, GABA, etc) which produce the immediate “high” when they affect certain areas associated with pleasure response, but also the side effects (headache, nausea, etc).  Long-term use of solvents can actually cause permanent damage to these nerves through build up of high-concentrations and destruction of myelin.   Other inhalants—such as nitrous oxide—work similarly by temporarily interfering with cell receptors, but long-term deplete essential cofactor vitamins such as B12, which is also necessary for nerve function.
