3300,ELI5: How does raising interest rates slow/lower inflation?,"Inflation means too much money is moving too quickly, chasing after a limited quantity of goods so the price of goods rises.  Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage payments for home owners and higher cost of borrowing for people who want to borrow money to build things like homes.  Banks are allowed to lend out something like 20x the amount of cash they actually have, so when people borrow at low interest rates money is basically being created out of nothing and put into the economy chasing after the finite amount of real goods available.  Higher interest rates discourage borrowing so they are slowing the flow of cash and instead encouraging people to pay off their debts which will allow for borrowing in the future when we want to Rev up the economy.",Do people really take out loans to pay for food often enough to move the price? Seems like a interest hike would punish people that hold big-ticket debt (like mortgages) and not do anything to curb inflation in essential consumables.,Related,">Inflation means too much money is moving too quickly, chasing after a limited quantity of goods so the price of goods rises.    Is this a fair way to put it?   I think the Fed is trying to slow the flow of cash because they are concerned that inflation will eventually lead to deflation.  If the Fed raises interest rates, it will raise the cost of borrowing and increase the cost for people to pay off their debts.  I don't see how this is a bad thing because it means that people will be able to pay down their debts faster.  But if the Fed were to raise rates, wouldn't that mean that inflation would go down?"

3301,"ELI5: Why do computers slow down, but then you restart them and they work again?","There are several reasons, but one of the most-common reasons is that everything you do on your computer takes up some of the limited memory in the computer (specifically the RAM, or Random Access Memory, which is different than space on a disk).

The body is a very conductive tissue.    The way we measure body fat is by using electrical impulses.  The electrical impulses are generated by the cells in the body and are transmitted through the body.  They are the same way that electricity is transmitted from a telephone wire to a computer.  But the way the electrical impulses get to the computer is different.  It's called the ""circulation"" principle.  And the way it works is that the electrical impulse is created by the fat cells in your body and then transmitted to the computers.  Then the computer uses the information from the electrical signals to calculate the body fat.  In this way, the computer calculates the body weight using the information the computer has received.  How does the computer know the body is fat?  The answer is that it measures the electrical conductance of the body cells.  That's how we know the weight of a person.  By measuring the electrical current through the cells."

This is a bit of a stretch, but I think it's worth noting that the Impressionist's are not the only ones who impersonating other people.

3309,ELI5: What is the point to longer-than-life sentences to criminals in the USA?,It can affect parole. Normally these types of sentences are imposed on people who have committed multiple serious crimes and serve as a method to ensure they stay behind bars forever.
