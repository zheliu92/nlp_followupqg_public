3098,"ELI5: When downloading something, how does the server know how fast it can send you data moment to moment? How does it avoid sending data faster than you can receive it?",This is one of the things that TCP handles. The server will start a bit conservatively and send packets as a low speed. But when it receives ACK packets showing that the transfer is going well it will ramp up the speed. It will do this until it no longer receives ACK packets in a reasonable time and have to retransmit the packages. This is an indication that there is a bottleneck somewhere and packets are being dropped. So it will slow down a bit and try to find the sweet spot.,"Thanks! So I’m assuming there are some other technical complications that it handles too. Like latency can change moment to moment too, which would screw with the timing of the AWK packets. How does it deal with that? Would having a lot of jitter in the connection cause TCP to lower the download speed?",Slightly Related,How does the server know how fast it can send you data moment to moment?
