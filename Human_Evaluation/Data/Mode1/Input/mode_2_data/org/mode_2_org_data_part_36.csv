3350,ELI5: How does a 24th chromosome work?,Down syndrome is only when it is an extra 21st chromosome. There are other trisomies (extra chromosomes so there are 3 instead of 2) that cause other syndromes. Several of them typically cause miscarriage or infant death. Some aren't as serious. None cause enhanced abilities.,"So just to clarify, its not really a 24th chromosome pair and more of a 47th chromosome?  Also if theres no enhanced abilites, how do you explain my dong! yeah haha gottem! Gg",Related,>There are other trisomies (extra chromosomes so there are 3 instead of 2) that cause other syndromes.  What do those syndromies have to do with Down syndrome?

3351,ELI5: How does a 24th chromosome work?,"An embryo with one or more extra chromosomes doesn't just get entirely new ones with genes that the average person doesn't have. Rather, one of the chromosomes that we all have a pair of gets an extra copy, so the embryo has three instead of the regular two.   For most chromosomes, if you have three instead of two, it doesn't lead to viable embryo. The child will die either in the uterus, or at a young age. For some chromosomes, the ""damage"" is less severe, and the child will survive, but may have health problems, including often a reduced life expectancy. Down syndrome, for instance, is caused by a *trisomy* (three chromosome copies) of the 21st chromosome (we all have 23 chromosome pairs that scientists have labeled with numbers 1-23).  Down syndrome is always caused by trisomy of the 21st chromosome, but there are other trisomies that are compatible with life and lead to different symptoms, such as trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). The latter is more severe and often results in miscarriage too, but some fetuses do survive.   For sex chromosomes, i.e. X and Y, typical females have a pair, XX, while typical males have two different copies, XY. You can have trisomy of these sex chromosomes too, leading to combinations like XXX, XXY or XYY. These trisomies are often more benign and not always associated with (noticeable) symptoms, to the point where people may live their lives not knowing they have three sex chromosomes until it happens to come up in a genetic test.","When someone has a third copy of a chromosome, is that because one of the chromosome splits or is it just a third copy. Also, do we know the reason why this happens or is it a random event?",Related,">For most chromosomes, if you have three instead of two, it doesn't lead to viable embryo. The child will die either in the uterus, or at a young age.    What about the embryos with one extra copy?"

One safeguard available is for the artist to provide an authenticity certificate along with his sold painting to prove that it's the ""one true"" painting. There are many copies, but only ""one true"" painting.  For NFTs involving digital art, they're trying to replicate that concept using a central server as ""proof of authenticity"".

3359,ELI5: Why are elements measured in their half-life rather than their full life?,"Because the decay is random.   A half life of 100 years, for example, means that after 100 years, 50% of the substance will have decayed and 50% will remain. After 200 years, 75% will have decayed and 25% will remain.
