3000,ELI5 Do animals tan?,"Animals can get sunburned like we do, pigs for example root in mud to cool off and because mud is a form of sun protection. Animals with fur cannot get sunburned where and when the fur covers them but can get burned on their lips and eyelids.",But can they tan? Does their body create color to protect them?,Related,"> Animals with fur cannot get sunburned where and when the fur covers them but can get burned on their lips, eyelids, and mouth.    This is a misconception.  The reason why piglets don't tan is because they don't have any fur to protect them from sun.  They have no natural tanning glands."
