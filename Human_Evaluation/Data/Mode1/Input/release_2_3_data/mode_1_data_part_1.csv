We can make devices that count the number of times the crystal has vibrated. So if the crystal is one that vibrates roughly 16,000 times per second, we can connect that counter to a device that counts up to 16,000 then sends a signal. Every signal represents 1 second passing. Now that we have a device that can count seconds (or fractions of a second), we can make a clock! (This is how digital watches work!)  So basically DSLRs and computers have tiny digital watches inside without a screen.   This isn\'t always super accurate. Cheaper crystals and mechanisms aren\'t exactly perfect. If I leave my Nintendo Switch disconnected from the internet, it\'s usually 2-3 minutes off of the ""correct"" time within 24 hours. That\'s why most computers and devices today have an option to either use internet time services or GPS to keep their time updated. GPS and internet time services use SUPER accurate clocks to keep time, so periodically syncing with them keeps the device ""on time enough"".', 'Your body didn’t evolve to do so. Ethanol is a naturally occurring substance, just leave some fruit for too long and you got a good amount. We had to evolve ways to break down that poison because if we didn’t we would die easily from eating slightly off food.   Gasoline is found deep, deep underground as part of crude oil. Sure, it has a lot of energy, but we never had occasion to need to evolve enzymes to break it down.', 'This is why you can turn the sail. You orient the sail so that it catches the wind, and then you have a centerboard which is a big flat piece of material sticking down into the water from the bottom of the boat.  The centerboard helps transfer directional force on the sail into forward motion for the ship because it only wants to move through the water the skinny way.', ""It's not exactly spitting, more like regurgitating. They're throwing up whatever is in their stomach along with saliva. It's akin to humans shoving a finger down their throat to puke, except that they don't need to shove anything physically.  Why do they do it? It's an act of defense against predators whenever they feel threatened by any creature."", 'When Tesla said “think of” he meant rigorously. Tesla thought in ways that created functioning machines - ie rigorous and realistic ways.    I would recommend taking courses on the resonant frequency of structures, on signal theory, on physics where energy calculations are used, things like potential energy and energy flux.    If you’re in college, find these courses in the syllabus. Or if you’re not in STEM and don’t know where to start, go to a STEM student or prof and help them find you classes where you’ll learn about those things: resonant frequency, signals, energy-based physics (such as calculating the height a roller coaster will go based on potential energy instead of based on velocity and acceleration), thermodynamics, waves.    And if you’re “bad at math”, change your self-conception and push yourself to get better. Math is about practice more than it is about talent. And math is necessary to really, truly appreciate the beauty of these ways of thinking. So make friends with math.    If you’re not at a university, use Khan academy or any university’s free online courses to study this stuff.     The key point is to study it rigorously - this means homework and math, not just reading a popular science book about the mysteries of the universe.    Just like a musician needs to play his scales, someone who wants to experience the beauty that Tesla is referring to needs to do his math homework.', ""Because we are all connected by the Force, through a grand human consciousness, through God, latent telepathic powers, what have you.

But essentially you haven't paid the owner of the rights to the material so it is considered theft. And therefore illegal.   By downloading you are still creating a copy of the material.   However the uploading is the bigger crime. Also by taking out uploaders there is nothing to download from.  Similar to drugs, target the dealers not the users. And the issue will go away.

When you say they are all the same pitch you are saying they have the same fundamental frequency, but they will have different levels of harmonics that all add up to make the voice's waveform.So the difference between men and a women singing the same exact note and sounding markedly different is due to the amplitude (strength) and phase (delay) of the harmonics that the voices also creates, that have frequencies of 2x, 3x, 4x, etc the fundamental frequency.

When you get to the moon you have a target landing spot that takes time to locate and then position the craft for landing and make a soft touchdown.
