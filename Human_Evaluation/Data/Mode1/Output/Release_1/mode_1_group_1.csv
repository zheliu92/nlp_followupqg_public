We can make devices that count the number of times the crystal has vibrated. So if the crystal is one that vibrates roughly 16,000 times per second, we can connect that counter to a device that counts up to 16,000 then sends a signal. Every signal represents 1 second passing. Now that we have a device that can count seconds (or fractions of a second), we can make a clock! (This is how digital watches work!)  So basically DSLRs and computers have tiny digital watches inside without a screen.   This isn\\\u0027t always super accurate. Cheaper crystals and mechanisms aren\\\u0027t exactly perfect. If I leave my Nintendo Switch disconnected from the internet, it\\\u0027s usually 2-3 minutes off of the \u0022correct\u0022 time within 24 hours. That\\\u0027s why most computers and devices today have an option to either use internet time services or GPS to keep their time updated. GPS and internet time services use SUPER accurate clocks to keep time, so periodically syncing with them keeps the device \u0022on time enough\u0022.\u0027, \u0027Your body didn\u2019t evolve to do so. Ethanol is a naturally occurring substance, just leave some fruit for too long and you got a good amount. We had to evolve ways to break down that poison because if we didn\u2019t we would die easily from eating slightly off food.   Gasoline is found deep, deep underground as part of crude oil. Sure, it has a lot of energy, but we never had occasion to need to evolve enzymes to break it down.\u0027, \u0027This is why you can turn the sail. You orient the sail so that it catches the wind, and then you have a centerboard which is a big flat piece of material sticking down into the water from the bottom of the boat.  The centerboard helps transfer directional force on the sail into forward motion for the ship because it only wants to move through the water the skinny way.\u0027, \u0022It\u0027s not exactly spitting, more like regurgitating. They\u0027re throwing up whatever is in their stomach along with saliva. It\u0027s akin to humans shoving a finger down their throat to puke, except that they don\u0027t need to shove anything physically.  Why do they do it? It\u0027s an act of defense against predators whenever they feel threatened by any creature.\u0022, \u0027When Tesla said \u201Cthink of\u201D he meant rigorously. Tesla thought in ways that created functioning machines - ie rigorous and realistic ways.    I would recommend taking courses on the resonant frequency of structures, on signal theory, on physics where energy calculations are used, things like potential energy and energy flux.    If you\u2019re in college, find these courses in the syllabus. Or if you\u2019re not in STEM and don\u2019t know where to start, go to a STEM student or prof and help them find you classes where you\u2019ll learn about those things: resonant frequency, signals, energy-based physics (such as calculating the height a roller coaster will go based on potential energy instead of based on velocity and acceleration), thermodynamics, waves.    And if you\u2019re \u201Cbad at math\u201D, change your self-conception and push yourself to get better. Math is about practice more than it is about talent. And math is necessary to really, truly appreciate the beauty of these ways of thinking. So make friends with math.    If you\u2019re not at a university, use Khan academy or any university\u2019s free online courses to study this stuff.     The key point is to study it rigorously - this means homework and math, not just reading a popular science book about the mysteries of the universe.    Just like a musician needs to play his scales, someone who wants to experience the beauty that Tesla is referring to needs to do his math homework.\u0027, \u0022Because we are all connected by the Force, through a grand human consciousness, through God, latent telepathic powers, what have you. You are sometimes able to tap into this network and receive more information than you could otherwise normally be expected to have. I\u0027m comfortable just saying it\u0027s God but I realize that other people have other explanations for this.\u0022, \u0022My understanding is:  The downloading isn\u0027t so much the crime. But essentially you haven\u0027t paid the owner of the rights to the material so it is considered theft. And therefore illegal.   By downloading you are still creating a copy of the material.   However the uploading is the bigger crime. Also by taking out uploaders there is nothing to download from.  Similar to drugs, target the dealers not the users. And the issue will go away. (that\u0027s the theory anyway?)   I am not a lawyer though!\u0022, \u0022Sounds consist of more than one frequency that are all (usually) multiples of the fundamental. When you say they are all the same pitch you are saying they have the same fundamental frequency, but they will have different levels of harmonics that all add up to make the voice\u0027s waveform.So the difference between men and a women singing the same exact note and sounding markedly different is due to the amplitude (strength) and phase (delay) of the harmonics that the voices also creates, that have frequencies of 2x, 3x, 4x, etc the fundamental frequency.  EDIT : I just realized OP asked for biological answer, then there\u0027s already some explanation on another comment. My answer is more like physics and mathematics.  Actual ELI5 : Hershey\u0027s and Kit Kat taste different but they\u0027re both chocolate. That is because both of them have the same main chocolate ingredients (fundamental frequency) and different additional ingredients like sweetener, peanut, milk, etc (harmonic)  Read more: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre)\u0022, \u0027Because otherwise they\\\u0027ll spill out of the prep area.  Water is a bit of a glue and sticks to materials, unlike other liquids such as liquid [mercury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiWlthrtneU) for example.  Your hands get wet because water sticks to them (like a glue); your hands will NOT get wet if you stick  them in mercury.  But water won\\\u0027t stick to flour, it\\\u0027s too porous, and will thus \u0022roll off\u0022 the flour area / prep area, if it\\\u0027s flat.  Thus they make a hole in the center, so that it forms a bowl and gravity keeps the liquid there.\u0027, \u0027A combination of things, including the fact that what is nearby today was far away until quite recently, when the maximum speed of sustained travel was a few miles an hour unless you were switching mounts. Further, there is a bit of in-group dynamics, having an accent is a sign of belonging to a select group and can be a badge of pride.\u0027, \u0027It has a tiny, battery powered clock inside.  The device is not expensive, and that limits the precision of the clock inside.  The Host has access to extremely accurate time, so sync problems are certain to occur if you wait long enough.  The RSA design has enough tolerance built into it that the design life of the battery is less than the likely time to get out of sync.  Some batteries are extra good, some tokens are subject to unusual stresses, stuff can happen.\u0027, \u0027When you launch from Earth you have to fight gravity which accounts for a small portion. When you get to the moon you have a target landing spot that takes time to locate and then position the craft for landing and make a soft touchdown. When leaving, you just launch when the orbital capsule is at peak target distance. Then you hook up and fire the rockets from very little gravity and begin the trip home. Once you reach earth you do have a target range but your flight is calculated to take you right to the ocean where ships are waiting.   Like going to the store\u2026 you have to get there then search for a parking spot which can take time. But leaving is straight out of the lot and home.\u0027, \u0022As much as I know about combustion engines and hydrogen, I have encountered so many different reasons as to why they never took off.  So I\u0027m following to see if there is a proper answer. Fingers crossed.\u0022, \u0027Evolution takes a very very long time to actually be effective.  You cant just take one fish and train it to do something and hope its offspring develop immunity.   The whole lineage needs to be affected, all at once.\u0027, \u0027Space junk animations are not to scale.  Space is flippin huge and satellites are small compared to space.  Even buss sized satellites are small compared to how much room there is.  Plus satellites are at different altitudes.  In fact you could spend your while life on a satellite and never see another satellite.\u0027, \u0022Go for it. You\u0027ll lose money in the long run.  There\u0027s 32 teams, so that\u0027s a $32 bet. You\u0027d need one of the teams with odds greater than \u002B3200 to win for you to make money. Otherwise, you\u0027d lose.  If I bet $1 on a team with \u002B350 odds, I will win my $1 back plus an additional $3.5 dollars. That doesn\u0027t offset the $32 I spent on the other teams.\u0022, \u0027You would not be left with $5k, you would be left with $15k.  You don\\\u0027t debit \u0022from\u0022 an asset account, you debit \u0022into\u0022 it.  A credit to an asset account is taking \u0022from\u0022 it.\u0027, \u0022It\u0027s doable from a technical perspective, but it now means that you have to dramatically increase the total number of batteries in circulation as you need more than one for each vehicle on the road. Batteries are already a pretty extreme production and cost concern (roughly half the value of an EV is just the battery), and increasing the number of battery packs would inevitably mean increasing costs for the consumers who buy the EV.\u0022, \u0022Two competing theories.  One is that the rings were once a moon that entered the planets Roche limit, the point in which the main bodies tidal forces overpower the moons own gravity and it\u0027s pulled apart.  The second is that it\u0027s left over material from the formation of Saturn that never fell into Saturn but was too close to form into a moon in the first place (because of the Roche limit)  They first means the rings weren\u0027t always there, and their age would be unknown and thus it\u0027s possible they may decay at some point.  The second means the rings were always there, and are stable enough to last 4.5 billions years, implying they are going nowhere.  Edit:  I just remembered, the rings are shrinking, and have a life expectancy of 100-300 million years and this likely points to the moon hypothesis.\u0022, \u0027Tap, lake, and pool water is not the same pH and salinity as the fluids in your body, causing it to leech out electrolytes from the various membranes in your sinus cavity. That is the burning sensation you feel.  A blocked nose happens when the mucous membrane inside your nose/throat expels some waste (as a result of fighting the infection). This waste is basically snot, and it is thick (to coat the infection and not let it spread).  Breathing in steam - hot humid air - thins out the snot and makes it easier for it to flow out / be blown out.\u0027]"",""ColumnHeader"":""answer"",""DataType"":"""",""Position"":2},{""CellData"":""[\u0022What role does the microprocessor play in the functioning of a DSLR\u0027s internal clock?\u0022,
