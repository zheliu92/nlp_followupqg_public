It\u0027s not that there\u0027s less water overall, it\u0027s just that changing weather patterns changes where the water is going, which is places were it\u0027s either not needed or inaccessible.   For example, less winter snow in the Rocky Mountains means less spring and summer water in the Colorado River watershed which provides water for much of The Southwestern U.S., eventually emptying in the Pacific. At the same time, Typhoons in the pacific are getting bigger and more frequent, so there\u0027s more water being dumped back into the ocean. In other words, water that used to fall as snow in the Rockies is now falling as rain in the Pacific Ocean where it\u0027s unusable. That\u0027s a simplistic explanation but you get the drift.\u0022, \u0022The chip and/or the PIN are a means of verifying the transaction is legit.  On a card without the chip, the only data is its number, the expiration date, and maybe the verification code on the back. The magnetic stripe is usually just the card number. These kinds of terminals require the PIN because (hopefully) only the authorized cardholder knows that PIN. These cards are easy to duplicate so we NEED extra security measures.  Cards with a chip, on the other hand, are a lot harder to replicate. The chip is actually a tiny computer that does some math on some inputs and generates numbers in a way that isn\u0027t easy to guess even if you see it done for a few thousand inputs. The bank who issues the card knows the secret information that makes it possible to predict the numbers. So, oversimplified, when you use a chip reader, the terminal gives the chip some inputs, gets the chip\u0027s result, then sends the inputs and the results to the bank. The bank verifies that the inputs should produce that output on your chip. So in a way, the chip IS the PIN, but it\u0027s more secure than that because you can\u0027t accidentally give someone knowledge that makes them able to replicate your chip.  It\u0027s probably possible to copy a card with a chip, but it would take a high degree of sophistication and someone would have to physically steal your card to do it. You can\u0027t reproduce the chip from observing a single read, and in theory even seeing hundreds of thousands of input/output wouldn\u0027t be useful. Because it\u0027s incredibly close to impossible to duplicate these chips, when a terminal uses the chip as an ID you don\u0027t have to use a PIN. The assumption is it means someone would\u0027ve had to have stolen your actual card and you\u0027d probably notice that much more quickly than it takes to figure out someone\u0027s skimmed a traditional card.\u0022, \u0022The public\\xa0holds over $22 trillion of the national debt.1 Foreign governments hold a large portion of the public debt, while the rest is owned by U.S. banks and investors, the Federal Reserve, state and local governments, mutual funds, pensions funds, insurance companies, and savings bonds. China being the most popular foreign country to point out. Sure we could refuse to pay- but then why would someone loan us money next time we need help if we prove we won\u0027t pay it back? It would also make the savings bonds of millions of Americans worthless- which would collapse their retirement goals. Plus that would definitely hurt us in our efforts of international trade.\u0022, \u0027there used to be pots and pans that u plugged in and they would heat up and all that. idk if there still are. they were rather awkward to clean tbh.   maybe thats the crux of it. it would be reall quote difficult to clean it like a normal dish so its function is overshadowed by its use upkeep\u0027, \u0027There\u2019s been a few historical perpetual pots of food over the years. One in Bangkok I think was a few hundred years old. As long as they are kept at food safe temperatures and enough is being added and taken, it\u2019s possible.\u0027, \u0027They don\u2019t breath the same way mammals do. They have tubes in various parts of their body that expose their circulatory system to air where it absorbs oxygen. Because they don\u2019t inhale, they air limited in size by the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. Which is why they used to be bigger in past eras when there was more oxygen in the atmosphere.\u0027, \u0027The brain runs a LOT of processes sub-consciously, that is, you are not even aware of them going unless some of them turn up something that the brain thinks should be brought to conscious attention. The brain has a mental picture of your room stored for reference, and when it sees something has changed, it will sound an alarm bringing this fact to consciousness, because it\u2019s pretty important for safety reasons, obviously.\u0027, \u0022Why would I pay $1000 for a TV today when it will be cheaper tomorrow.   Obviously not that simple.  But if people don\u0027t spend money, shops go broke, people lose jobs etc\u0022, \u0027Conservation of matter:  (weight of food) - (weight of poop) - (weight of pee) = weight gained by your body?    Actually, a bit more complicated, because you breathe in O2 and expel CO2 (so you lose carbons  from the \u0022weight of food\u0022).  You also sweat out some of the water you just ingested.\u0027, \u0027Here\u2019s the short short answer. Big animals need A LOT of energy. Like a ridiculous amount. An entire ecosystem of massive organisms. Just couldn\u2019t work.  Most would starve. But a massive ecosystem of tiny organisms is possible. They require a lot of energy done their body size, but not overall - and so we get lots of smaller species, that don\u2019t store much energy, like mice.\u0027, \u0022Say you increase the size by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. That would result in quadruple the distance between two components - and while electrons do travel with very high speeds (not quite light speed, but close, relatively speaking) with the amount of electrons being moved you\u0027d have a much slower CPU in the end.  That\u0027s why the actual transistors are getting smaller and smaller - so you can pack them more densely and reduce the distance between them, to make faster CPUs.\u0022, \u0027Sound travels through solid objects, some much better than others.  Stand in a closed bank safe and scream your head off, no one outside is going to hear you.  Wrap yourself in tissue paper and talk normally and people will hear you the same as if you weren\\\u0027t wrapped up.  Apartment walls fall somewhere in between, with some being thick and solid with multiple layers of plaster and insulation that do a really good job absorbing (and dissipating) sound waves without transmitting them through the wall.  Others are hollow spaces with a thin sheet of drywall on either side, and these tend to do a really poor job of absorbing the sound waves.  These \u0022thin walls\u0022 make it easier to hear what\\\u0027s happening on the other side.\u0027, \u0022Toothpaste has tin in it, and tin has a bad metallic taste.  To overpower that, it takes a strong flavor, like mint or peppermint.  Other than cinnamon, there aren\u0027t many low cost flavors that will cover the tin taste.\u0022, \u0027In a nutshell, the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength.  Since frequency is a measurement of how many times an electromagnetic wave passes a fixed point per second, that means that shorter waves are going to pass more often, and therefore have a higher frequency.\u0027, \u0027Curing cancer is like trying to develope a weapon that when fired into a crowd will only kill terrorists. Cancer cells are still your own cells and mostly behave like normal cells (in terms of what kills them). So the big question scientists have to find an answer too is: what differentiates cancer cells enough from healthy cells to kill them off without killing the rest of the body with them.\u0027, \u0022Our ears are an odd shape, so the sound bounces around differently, depending on where the sound is coming from.   When you\u0027re very young, your brain figures out that if a sound sounds a certain way, it\u0027s probably coming from a certain direction.\u0022, \u0027with universal basic income, people can still take a normal job as bonus money, or work on their passion projects, or be poor with basic needs met.\u0027, \u0022It\u0027s when a partition on a physical drive (when your computer says C: or D:, for instance), can spread to one or more drive physical drive to fits its needs for size and speed. For instance, if your D: Drive is across an HDD and an SSD, you get a dynamic volume that can take advantage of both as needed, but is also dependent on the presence and survivability of both woth work.  However, it does not necessarily have to be on multiple physical drives, as it can increase its own size on the same drive as it needs to, automatically.   Basically, a dynamic drive is a drive that adjusts its specs to fit what it needs.\u0022, \u0022Supply and demand.  Imagine there is 100 of a thing that people want, and 100 people want it. The supply and demand are equal so the price stays the same (equal amount of sales and buys)  Now if only 10 people want it, the price will drop (more selling than buying)  However if there\u0027s 1000 people trying to buy, the price will increase (more buying than selling)\u0022, \u0027Basically it uses small amounts of infrared light that is reflected off objects naturally, then it converts them using optoelectric image enhancement changing it from the invisible infared into the green light show that is placed right in front of you. The shitty thing about night vision is if you are moving with it your depth perception is shit. They have also have some newer types of night vision that use other digitial enhancment but I never played with those so idk how those work.\u0027]"",""ColumnHeader"":""answer"",""DataType"":"""",""Position"":2},{""CellData"":""[\u0027How does the increased frequency of extreme weather events affect water distribution?\u0027,
