Think of it as covering up a road to a house, rather than demolishing the house itself. Then, later, when the computer ends up writing new information, it\u0027ll go over that space on the drive that the files occupied, in the previous example, destroying the old house to put up a new one. There are security programs you can have that will actually remove the file itself, overwriting the space with nothing rather than just removing the path.\u0022, \u0022Tiny changes in those small animals allow them to fulfill different niches and avoid competition.  A tiny change in a crocodiles morphology wouldn\u0027t do as much the separate it from the other croc species.    Ex.  A slight change in the size of a birds beak (I know I changed examples but still) will change its primary food source.  A small change in a crocs mouth.. will still make it be a top predator.\u0022, \u0027It\u2019s not so much the pain of a wound, but the brain\u2019s response to pain going away that makes you want to touch an injury.  When you touch a bruise or similar minor injury, it hurts for a moment. The pain subsiding causes the brain to release a stimulus of pleasure because the pain is subsiding. It\u2019s that release of pleasure that somewhat tempts you to touch it more.\u0027, \u0027Former auto/boat repo person here. The reason you often have to do some sneaking is because the person who you are repo\u2019ing from obviously doesn\u2019t want you to take the vehicle, and will resist you taking it.   You do have the legal right to take the property, however you have limited power to use any force. So if the person sees you about to repo their car, and decides to jump into the car, you can not physically remove them. You also can not tow the car with them inside it. If you can block the car from leaving it\u2019s current location then you have every right to call the police, and they will gladly force the person to get out, and assist you with the repo. This sounds great but the downside is that you have to stay with the car until the police arrive. This could take an hour or more. All the while, you have to babysit the car and deal with the person/people trying to stop you.\u0027, \u0027I study in this field of research actually, Chronobiology and Memory. Search up the circadian clock. Basically you are now adapted (entrained) to sleeping late and napping in the middle of the day, probably due to warmer temperatures, lack of energy or big meals. Light and temperature are both very prominent factors (zeitgeber) which help regulate your biological clock down to the molecular levels.  No phone, lights out and sleep at night. Then wake up early with fresh sunlight every morning for the next few days and you should be entrained back to the regular circadian rhythm !  Note: Can depend on your health and age and a lot of other factors.\u0027, \u0022Because you can\u0027t mix any colours together to make red, yellow or blue.  Those three have to exist to create any other secondary colours.\u0022, \u0027Mostly it\u2019s because things are prepared and stored so poorly. If I recall, most meat and stuff could be eaten raw until salmonella and e-coli became rampant. This isn\u2019t to say that you could leave raw meat out and eat it, no, but you could definitely eat meat from a fresh kill. Nowadays there\u2019s too much risk, especially from mass meat production.\u0027, \u0022CRTs have some advantages over LCDs and other flat-panel display technologies that matter for certain niche applications. To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don\u0027t need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that\u0027s not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it\u0027s more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That\u0027s more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don\u0027t care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it\u0027s turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.  Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you\u0027re dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0). So e.g. if you really want to buy a NES today, your options are very limited as you\u0027re dependent on the ever-decreasing number of NES\u0027s in the world that still work, *and* that people are willing to sell. So even though very few people are looking to buy NES\u0027s, the supply is even smaller.  I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I\u0027m happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn\u0027t previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up. Also, often consoles that go out of production are superseded by newer models and the bulk of the demand will switch to them, while the collectors\u0027 market will take years to get off the ground. The only exception I can think of would be if the manufacturer (for some atypical reason) stopped producing the console before they had exhausted the (profitable) demand for it (and didn\u0027t release a new console yet).\u0022, \u0027I think your premise is wrong. There isn\u2019t a \u201Chighest quality lossless\u201D in audio. There are several tiers of quality in digital audio, of which there are millions of tracks on each level.  Typical PCM samplerates are 44.1kHz, 48k, 88.2k, 96k, 192k, and 384k, by 16, 24, and 32 bits.  For DSD audio it\u2019s DSD256, 512, 1024.  Hotel California was recorded, I believe, on 2-inch tape, which by the 70s was pretty clean, but by no means without coloration or noise. Again, millions of songs were recorded to tape, none of which are higher or lower quality than the other.\u0027, \u0027Because the more data that can be collected about you, the more \u0022they\u0022 know about you; who you are, your age, what you like, where you go, when you get paid and most importantly, what keeps you looking at a screen.  Why do they want you to look at a screen? You may ask.  Advertising.  Companies want to make money, and in order to do this they need to let people know about their products. But advertising your products costs a lot of money when you are trying to reach a wider audience.  So they target specific demographics.  Where before, they would\\\u0027ve advertised on a certain website, or in a certain area, advertisers can now target specific people. People they know like the kind of things they are selling. People of a particular age and gender who like to purchase products similar to yours.  By targeting more specifically, they have more chance of making a sale per dollar spent on advertising. So companies who harvest data from us sell it to 3rd party advertisers. And with the amount of people putting their entire lives online, and the amount of money that can be made from selling stuff to them, means it\\\u0027s a big money business.  Then there\\\u0027s the illegal side of the industry.  Your private data, such as passwords and credit card details, the kind of stuff that is kept hidden (or encrypted) online, is very valuable to cyber criminals who can buy such data on the dark web. They may want phone numbers or email addresses to try and scam through phishing emails etc. Or buy credit card details to commit fraud. They can also purchase malicious software (malware) to try and steal data from companies who don\\\u0027t have a robust enough security system.\u0027, \u0022So, this works on roughly the same principle as the GPS receiver built into your phone.  If I give you a map and tell you that I\u0027m fifteen miles away from this particular point, then you can map out a thirty-mile-wide circle where I can be anywhere along the circumference.  If I give you another point and say that I\u0027m a certain distance away from *that* point as well, you can narrow down where I could be based on the intersection of the two circles.  A third point/distance pair is sufficient to get a single approximate location, and further pairs refine the location further, as well as providing redundancy in case of signal loss.  This is, broadly speaking, the purpose of the pulsar map on the Pioneer plaque (and the Voyager record, as well): fourteen mapped pulsars, with distances and frequencies attached, would give a sufficiently-advanced alien species all the information they would need to locate our solar system in space.\u0022, \u0022You\u0027d almost definitely need more money than you have to make a stock move in any sustained manner. Sure, if a stock trades $1m worth of shares on an average day and you buy $10m in a day it\u0027ll cause price to rise, but if demand isn\u0027t sustained then it\u0027ll fall right back down. Also, if you did that specifically to pump up price and then sell, that\u0027s fraud.\u0022, \u0027To my understanding, only fission of very large nuclei, and fusion of very small nuclei, are exothermic.     Trying to fuse very large nuclei will result in a net consumption of energy.\u0027, \u0027Freedom of speech does have certain limitations in particular inciting violence or threat. Its illegal to threaten to kill someone but remember that its that call to arms that\\\u0027s illegal. The words \u0022I\\\u0027m going to kill you\u0022 is not illegal because you can say it sarcastically, as a quote, or as an example as I just did. However, if you say \u0022I\\\u0027m going to kill you\u0022 then include a date, time, how you plan on doing it, etc then it becomes illegal.  Similarly, the argument for freedom of speech cannot be used to defend illegal market manipulation, fraud, insider trading, etc. It is the action that is illegal not the words. Market manipulation is illegal because only a few can benefit from it. In your example Warren Buffet says \u0022you should buy company X\\\u0027s stock\u0022 so a bunch of people buy it and increase the stock value and then Warren could pull all of his money out and make a ton of money but plummeting the stock price. That would effectively be stealing from the company and the people he told to buy the stock.  Pump and dump like that is very different than typical stock increases because it is not based on an intrinsic value. It is only increasing in value due to a perceived demand based on stock sales but has no relevance to the performance of the company. And while the process of buy low sell high in a short term is not illegal it brings a lot more risk to the table and not really considered \u0022investing\u0022 but more betting/gambling on the stock market.\u0027, \u0027Murder isn\\\u0027t a single thing.  There are lots of different situations that end up murdering people, and different individuals are drawn to different situations.  There\\\u0027s likely no \u0022reason\u0022 for this, that we will ever understand, just like there is often not a \u0022reason\u0022 that some individual is affected by mental illness.  Correlation is not causation.  Sure, it\\\u0027s possible that liberal school systems are systematically racist against against white males as part of some agenda, but those sorts of implicit biases are very hard to accurately understand or do anything about.  It\\\u0027s more likely to be a coincidence.\u0027, \u0027In the most general terms, a product goes into allocation when supply is unable to meet demand. The two basic reasons for this are a) supply has been disrupted and is lower than usual, or b) demand is higher than anticipated.   It might not be that the manufacturer is producing at the same rate, especially after the pandemic. Raw material supply might be disrupted, factories may have been run slower than normal, producers may not have anticipated more demand etc etc. Most factories cannot simply increase output - it could take weeks or months.\u0027, \u0027You will serve 25 years with zero possibility of parole. You will then be eligible for parole, but you\u2019re not guaranteed to ever get out.\u0027, \u0022In addition to what others have said, it depends a lot on the engine. Automobile engines are much better at burning old gas than 2-cycle engines (such as weedeaters). 8 month old gas will usually run just fine, even in a lawnmower, but for a smaller engine you\u0027ll want as fresh gas as possible.\u0022, \u0027You know how some (showy) pizzerias will stretch out pizza dough by throwing it up into to air? Well, more specifically, what\\\u0027s doing the stretching is the spin they put on the dough, which pulls the outer edges away from the center, while the top and bottom aren\\\u0027t pulled, turning the dough into a flat disc.  The same kind of thing happened in our solar system. Back when it was just a cloud of dust, it started spinning, and the top and bottom fell in toward the center while the sides stretched out. Eventually planets formed out of the dust, but they kept going in the same motion, \u0022spinning\u0022 (now orbiting) around the center (the sun) in a flat disc.\u0027, \u0027Sleep is probably one of the most underrated health concepts. Not having a set sleep schedule causes a deficit of sleep by messing with the circadian rhythm. Shift work and  losing sleep in general is one of the most deadly things you can do to your body. Shift workers generally don\u2019t live long, have substandard fitness, and increase the probability of cancer and chronic disease.  Edit: I\u2019m a shift worker. I\u2019ve aged \u2018at least\u2019 20 years in just the last 10.  Of all my coworkers who\u2019ve retired, only 1 has lived passed 70. Some coworkers didn\u2019t make it passed 45.\u0027]"",""ColumnHeader"":""answer"",""DataType"":"""",""Position"":2},{""CellData"":""[\u0027What is logical deletion and how does it work?\u0027,
