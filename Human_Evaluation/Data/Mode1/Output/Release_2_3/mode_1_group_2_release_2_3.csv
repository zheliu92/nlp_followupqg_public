Neither of them very clear. One personally, and two society-wise. Both depend on risk. The first to your self , the second as a group.   Your risk is based on how likely you are to actually cross paths with someone infectious and how likely that is to cause you serious harm. So are you in an at risk group and where are you are considerations.   The second - how likely you are to be part of a chain of infection, how at risk are the people around you and how well society - such as the health service is coping.   Masks not perfect and life always holds a risk. In the West we have never masked up for flu which kills thousands of people a year - around 20,000 in the U.K. annually I think - though we vaccinate the at risk. Possibly COVId may have some nasty long term consequences even if you dint get seriously ill. But if the consequences of COVID dropped to equivalent to flu , then it would hardly be unreasonable to behave in a similar way. I say that nit to suggest we wait till then ( if it ever happened) but as a comparative starting point. No one can really say at what precise point in infections and consequences between that \u2018flu\u2019 point and the worst of COVID is the point at which we are \u2018safe\u2019.   I expect government ps will come up with a balance of infection rates, hospitalisations and economics with a dose of politics.   Bear in mind that in the East people regularly wear masks on public transport so as either not to do catch viruses or not to spread them , I guess it\u2019s just considered normal hygiene even for colds.   That\u2019s a long winded way of saying that presuming you are not mandated by the governments and pretty much everyone has had access to a vaccine you will have to decide whether you feel either at risk yourself, or feel that you need to still protect other people.   Personally I feel like the vaccine plus some lowering of case rates make me feel safe enough - but I wear one sometimes out of consideration to people around me who are still wearing them or in particularly crowded and enclosed environments or both.\u0027, \u0027Gasoline doesn\u2019t burn as a liquid. It must be turned into a vapor or atomized somehow. A rag s a good way to promote vaporization, but it takes time. Having an electric fuel pump spray gasoline out of a cracked fuel line is the most common cause of vehicle fires.\u0027, \u0022In many cases it is because of sensory overload. It\u0027s what happens when the brain gives up processing the input correctly.\u0022, \u0027A headache is just that, a headache.  A migraine is a neurological condition that can come with fat more complex symptoms. these will often include a headache as an obvious one, but not always, and will often include other effects too.  Personally I can experience an aura distorting my vision (like looking at everything through the pattern made by the transporters in the original star trek), sickness, and numbness travelling through my arms and face alongside the headache (which is also a different type of headache, like a pressure behind the eyes).  Other people also experience things like a sensitivity to light or noise, and undoubtedly other things I am not aware of.  Some people have obvious triggers like certain foods or stresses, others are more of a mystery.  If I get a migraine, that is me often shut down for a day or more - the auras starting give me only a few minutes to stop doing things like driving before it becomes dangerous, and then I can be left dealing with the headache and vomiting for a significant period and unable to do anything else other than hiding in bed and trying to sleep through as much as possible. So no, not just a headache I can power through, but a complete show stopper for that day, and one that can cause major problems if I am not at home (or able to get a lift there within half an hour or so).\u0027, \u0027The answer is more simple than other people posting here would have you believe.  It\\\u0027s a for-profit system.  You are paying more, because there is a profit incentive for everyone all up and down the supply chain, for every aspect of your healthcare.  They all want their cut...which means you will be paying for those mark-ups.  If it weren\\\u0027t for the profit motive, you would be paying \u0022at cost\u0022 rates for everything.\u0027, \u0027My senior dog has had 4 teeth removed and also had two cleanings prior to the extractions. They say now dogs need cleanings every year which I\u2019ve only learned about in the past 5-6 years.  Humans eat ALOT of sugar. There is sugar in almost everything. Ie: milk, bread etc. that coupled with the purified water rise, which removes fluoride and magnesium from (tap)drinking water, contributes to cavities and magnesium deficiencies.\u0027, \u0022the lens probably didn\u0027t get you a 4k image. the high quality image that the film records would be the blurry image produced the cheap lens. image quality is limited by the weakest link which in this case is the plastic lens.   in other words... it won\u0027t be any clearer than the photos would have been when printed back in the 90s.\u0022, \u0027because the water in the sock pushes out the air.  The air is what acts as a spring between threads keeping only a minimum of threads touching the foot.  Add on the water, now every thread is madly in love with your skin.\u0027, \u0022If a disease only kills 1% of the population, it will be argued that it\u0027s not a big deal. But when that population is 300,000,000 people, you\u0027re talking about a disease that can kill 3 million people, a large number that shouldn\u0027t be ignored.   In other words, a statistically small average, when applied to a huge number is a huge number.   Another way to look at is if you roll a die. Each roll has a 1/6 chance of landing on the number 4. But if you roll it a million times, you\u0027ll get the number 4 over 150,000 times.   1% chance of dying by a certain disease sounds like it\u0027s not a big deal. But if everyone in the country was given a 100 sided die and told if they roll the number 54, they\u0027re dead, would you want to play that game?\u0022, \u0027It\u2019s also the size of piping in the sewers. Your gutters compared to the items clogging it are a lot closer in size than your poop and toilet paper is compared to the size of the sewer pipe in the streets. Your lateral (hookup from the house to the street) has the best chance of plugging because it\u2019s only a few inches wide. But once beyond that, you can have from 12\u201D to many feet in diameter before it hits your sewage treatment plant. It can clog but if your semi solids are the only thing going it, it would take a lot.   But that is exactly why you are not supposed to flush wipes down the toilet. Since they don\u2019t degrade in the water, they can clump together and clog stuff. Don\u2019t flush anything but pee, poop, or toilet paper.\u0027, \u0027A mole is just a number. It\\\u0027s a specific number, 6.02x10^23, which happens to be a very large number.  Sort of like how \u0022A dozen\u0022 is a number that means 12. If I ask you to get me a dozen bagels, you know I want 12 bagels. If I ask you to get me a mole of hydrogen atoms, you know I want 6.02x10^23 hydrogen atoms.  What the 1.008 grams means is that 1 mole of hydrogen weighs 1.008 grams. You can have a .0005 g sample because that\\\u0027s less than 1 mole...\u0027, \u0022Bear in mind, any claim that is sufficiently vague doesn\u0027t have to actually be based on anything, according to regulations about what products can say about themselves. I\u0027m not sure that the temperature of your body or the time you put it on will make all that much of a difference, though I suppose it is possible.   That said, assuming this is also antiperspirant and not just deodorant, most of them work by stopping sweat from coming out of the sweat glands.\u0022, \u0027Spectrum analysers often work based on something called the Fast Fourier Transform.  This is a mathematical technique which lets us look at a wave, let\\\u0027s say the sound of a lion\\\u0027s roar, and instead of looking at how it changes over time (like having a loud beginning, slowly getting quieter, and a few grumbles at the end), asking what other waves it is made of.  That feels like a big jump, but it\\\u0027s simpler than you think. Sticking with sound, you may know that the pitch of a sound is determined by something called it\\\u0027s frequency. This is mostly true, but it\\\u0027s not the full picture. Sounds are made up of lots and lots of frequencies all added together. This is what makes a violin sound different to a flute if they\\\u0027re playing the same note. What this means is that if you take a very simple wave which genuinely only has a single frequency, called a sine wave, and start adding very special amounts of other waves of very specific frequencies, you can actually build sounds from scratch - this is called \u0022additive synthesis\u0022, by the way.  What the Fast Fourier Transform does is tell you exactly what amount of *all* frequencies have gone into making whatever wave it\\\u0027s looking at. This is sometimes called a \u0022decomposition\u0022, because it is looking at what the wave is composed of.  Why is it associated with ghost hunters? Because they need some bullshit to hook people\\\u0027s attention and these things look cool and technical and a good storyteller can make a story out of it.\u0027, \u0027I was diagnosed last year at the age of 24.  Lost damn near 90 lbs over the course of 3 years and had other health issues before I went and got checked out.  It happens kinda randomly. My immune system mistook my beta cells with is what produces inlsuin in the pancreas and basically destroyed them all.  Without outside insulin I would probably die a early death and have worse feet and leg problems than I already do.   Type 1 and 2 diabetes ( in my non medical profession opinion) are separate illnesses that are often confused together.\u0027, \u0022Gas rose from a busted pipe through the ocean. When the gas leaves the ocean it can then catch fire and seemingly make it look like the water is burning when it\u0027s actually just the gas burning.   Nitrogen helps because fire needs oxygen. They use the nitrogen to displace the oxygen away from the gas so that it cannot burn. After closing the valve of course, or risk reignition.\u0022, \u0022It really depends on what type of plane your are talking about and the level of auto pilot that your plane has. But regardless yes it is more difficult than a car:  Controls: Steering is far more like a boat than like car only you have elevation as well. I\u0027m sure other redditors will go into greater detail but your controls are far more complex and if you are relying on the auto pilot you need to understand how to read and program that specific autopilot exactly. You can\u0027t learn to fly a Boeing 737-400 and then go fly a Boeing 737-800 - you\u0027d have to go specifically retrain (Boeing 737NG course).  Navigation: In a car you are driving on a road with road markings and road signs and nowadays with extremely an useful GPS lady to guide you along. A huge part of flying is navigating as there\u0027s no signs up in the air to guide you along. And with weather conditions you have to learn to navigate by instrumentation alone.  Radio: This is the reason I could never be a pilot - I do not understand what is being said over the radio and you cannot fly safely without having proper communication and radio discipline. You have to be listening closely at **all** times because there\u0027s no way to fly safely without listening out for air traffic control constantly.  Safety: If your aircraft experiences any problem in air you can\u0027t simple pull over and open the hood. Therefore every single of aspect of flying involves safety checks and doublechecks. And these are not things that you can skip like when you pull your car out in the morning and you don\u0027t checked for punctures. You must follow specific checklists each flight in particular order.\u0022, \u0022On the other hand, if there \\\\*was\\\\* some sort of universal password system on all sites, hackers would know exactly what setup to target with any brute force hacking approach. Not to mention that people who are going to write down their passwords would probably otherwise have picked something really weak anyway, so it doesn\u0027t make much difference.\u0022, \u0027Most people don\u2019t drink enough water. Many of the things you listed can be attributed to dehydration which is solved by hydration.\u0027, \u0022Earth travels in a circle around the Sun. Each lap around the sun takes 1 year, or 365 days. Every day, the Earth spins 1 time. We see the sun during the day when the part of Earth we are on is facing the sun, and we cannot see the sun at night because we are facing away from it.  The moon travels in circles around the Earth just like Earth travels around the sun. However, the moon o ly takes 1 month, or about 30 days, to make 1 lap around Earth.  We can see the moon at night some days and during the day other days because the sun and moon move across our sky at different speeds, so the times we see each one don\u0027t exactly match up.  Think of two racecars going around a circle track. If one car goes a little faster than the other, we will see it pass in front of us more times than the other car. But sometimes, both cars will happen to pass in front of us at the same time.\u0022, \u0027Most people will tell you it\u2019s because the flavours infuse when left for a day or two.   I think in most cases the primary factor is that you\u2019ve had a period of \u2018detachment\u2019 from the cooking process by leaving it for a day, so you can kind of enjoy it more - as if someone else has cooked it for you.\u0027]"",""ColumnHeader"":""answer"",""DataType"":"""",""Position"":2},{""CellData"":""[\u0027What are the benefits of using transparent face shields as an alternative to

Neither of them very clear. One personally, and two society-wise. Both depend on risk. The first to your self , the second as a group.   Your risk is based on how likely you are to actually cross paths with someone infectious and how likely that is to cause you serious harm. So are you in an at risk group and where are you are considerations.   The second - how likely you are to be part of a chain of infection, how at risk are the people around you and how well society - such as the health service is coping.   Masks not perfect and life always holds a risk. In the West we have never masked up for flu which kills thousands of people a year - around 20,000 in the U.K. annually I think - though we vaccinate the at risk. Possibly COVId may have some nasty long term consequences even if you dint get seriously ill. But if the consequences of COVID dropped to equivalent to flu , then it would hardly be unreasonable to behave in a similar way. I say that nit to suggest we wait till then ( if it ever happened) but as a comparative starting point. No one can really say at what precise point in infections and consequences between that \u2018flu\u2019 point and the worst of COVID is the point at which we are \u2018safe\u2019.   I expect government ps will come up with a balance of infection rates, hospitalisations and economics with a dose of politics.   Bear in mind that in the East people regularly wear masks on public transport so as either not to do catch viruses or not to spread them , I guess it\u2019s just considered normal hygiene even for colds.   That\u2019s a long winded way of saying that presuming you are not mandated by the governments and pretty much everyone has had access to a vaccine you will have to decide whether you feel either at risk yourself, or feel that you need to still protect other people.   Personally I feel like the vaccine plus some lowering of case rates make me feel safe enough - but I wear one sometimes out of consideration to people around me who are still wearing them or in particularly crowded and enclosed environments or both.\u0027, \u0027Gasoline doesn\u2019t burn as a liquid. It must be turned into a vapor or atomized somehow. A rag s a good way to promote vaporization, but it takes time. Having an electric fuel pump spray gasoline out of a cracked fuel line is the most common cause of vehicle fires.\u0027, \u0022In many cases it is because of sensory overload. It\u0027s what happens when the brain gives up processing the input correctly.\u0022, \u0027A headache is just that, a headache.  A migraine is a neurological condition that can come with fat more complex symptoms. these will often include a headache as an obvious one, but not always, and will often include other effects too.  Personally I can experience an aura distorting my vision (like looking at everything through the pattern made by the transporters in the original star trek), sickness, and numbness travelling through my arms and face alongside the headache (which is also a different type of headache, like a pressure behind the eyes).  Other people also experience things like a sensitivity to light or noise, and undoubtedly other things I am not aware of.  Some people have obvious triggers like certain foods or stresses, others are more of a mystery.  If I get a migraine, that is me often shut down for a day or more - the auras starting give me only a few minutes to stop doing things like driving before it becomes dangerous, and then I can be left dealing with the headache and vomiting for a significant period and unable to do anything else other than hiding in bed and trying to sleep through as much as possible. So no, not just a headache I can power through, but a complete show stopper for that day, and one that can cause major problems if I am not at home (or able to get a lift there within half an hour or so).\u0027, \u0027The answer is more simple than other people posting here would have you believe.  It\\\u0027s a for-profit system.  You are paying more, because there is a profit incentive for everyone all up and down the supply chain, for every aspect of your healthcare.  They all want their cut...which means you will be paying for those mark-ups.  If it weren\\\u0027t for the profit motive, you would be paying \u0022at cost\u0022 rates for everything.\u0027, \u0027My senior dog has had 4 teeth removed and also had two cleanings prior to the extractions. They say now dogs need cleanings every year which I\u2019ve only learned about in the past 5-6 years.  Humans eat ALOT of sugar. There is sugar in almost everything. Ie: milk, bread etc. that coupled with the purified water rise, which removes fluoride and magnesium from (tap)drinking water, contributes to cavities and magnesium deficiencies.\u0027, \u0022the lens probably didn\u0027t get you a 4k image. the high quality image that the film records would be the blurry image produced the cheap lens. image quality is limited by the weakest link which in this case is the plastic lens.   in other words... it won\u0027t be any clearer than the photos would have been when printed back in the 90s.\u0022, \u0027because the water in the sock pushes out the air.  The air is what acts as a spring between threads keeping only a minimum of threads touching the foot.  Add on the water, now every thread is madly in love with your skin.\u0027, \u0022If a disease only kills 1% of the population, it will be argued that it\u0027s not a big deal. But when that population is 300,000,000 people, you\u0027re talking about a disease that can kill 3 million people, a large number that shouldn\u0027t be ignored.   In other words, a statistically small average, when applied to a huge number is a huge number.   Another way to look at is if you roll a die. Each roll has a 1/6 chance of landing on the number 4. But if you roll it a million times, you\u0027ll get the number 4 over 150,000 times.   1% chance of dying by a certain disease sounds like it\u0027s not a big deal. But if everyone in the country was given a 100 sided die and told if they roll the number 54, they\u0027re dead, would you want to play that game?\u0022, \u0027It\u2019s also the size of piping in the sewers. Your gutters compared to the items clogging it are a lot closer in size than your poop and toilet paper is compared to the size of the sewer pipe in the streets. Your lateral (hookup from the house to the street) has the best chance of plugging because it\u2019s only a few inches wide. But once beyond that, you can have from 12\u201D to many feet in diameter before it hits your sewage treatment plant. It can clog but if your semi solids are the only thing going it, it would take a lot.   But that is exactly why you are not supposed to flush wipes down the toilet. Since they don\u2019t degrade in the water, they can clump together and clog stuff. Don\u2019t flush anything but pee, poop, or toilet paper.\u0027, \u0027A mole is just a number. It\\\u0027s a specific number, 6.02x10^23, which happens to be a very large number.  Sort of like how \u0022A dozen\u0022 is a number that means 12. If I ask you to get me a dozen bagels, you know I want 12 bagels. If I ask you to get me a mole of hydrogen atoms, you know I want 6.02x10^23 hydrogen atoms.  What the 1.008 grams means is that 1 mole of hydrogen weighs 1.008 grams. You can have a .0005 g sample because that\\\u0027s less than 1 mole...\u0027, \u0022Bear in mind, any claim that is sufficiently vague doesn\u0027t have to actually be based on anything, according to regulations about what products can say about themselves. I\u0027m not sure that the temperature of your body or the time you put it on will make all that much of a difference, though I suppose it is possible.   That said, assuming this is also antiperspirant and not just deodorant, most of them work by stopping sweat from coming out of the sweat glands.\u0022, \u0027Spectrum analysers often work based on something called the Fast Fourier Transform.  This is a mathematical technique which lets us look at a wave, let\\\u0027s say the sound of a lion\\\u0027s roar, and instead of looking at how it changes over time (like having a loud beginning, slowly getting quieter, and a few grumbles at the end), asking what other waves it is made of.  That feels like a big jump, but it\\\u0027s simpler than you think. Sticking with sound, you may know that the pitch of a sound is determined by something called it\\\u0027s frequency. This is mostly true, but it\\\u0027s not the full picture. Sounds are made up of lots and lots of frequencies all added together. This is what makes a violin sound different to a flute if they\\\u0027re playing the same note. What this means is that if you take a very simple wave which genuinely only has a single frequency, called a sine wave, and start adding very special amounts of other waves of very specific frequencies, you can actually build sounds from scratch - this is called \u0022additive synthesis\u0022, by the way.  What the Fast Fourier Transform does is tell you exactly what amount of *all* frequencies have gone into making whatever wave it\\\u0027s looking at. This is sometimes called a \u0022decomposition\u0022, because it is looking at what the wave is composed of.  Why is it associated with ghost hunters? Because they need some bullshit to hook people\\\u0027s attention and these things look cool and technical and a good storyteller can make a story out of it.\u0027, \u0027I was diagnosed last year at the age of 24.  Lost damn near 90 lbs over the course of 3 years and had other health issues before I went and got checked out.  It happens kinda randomly. My immune system mistook my beta cells with is what produces inlsuin in the pancreas and basically destroyed them all.  Without outside insulin I would probably die a early death and have worse feet and leg problems than I already do.   Type 1 and 2 diabetes ( in my non medical profession opinion) are separate illnesses that are often confused together.\u0027, \u0022Gas rose from a busted pipe through the ocean. When the gas leaves the ocean it can then catch fire and seemingly make it look like the water is burning when it\u0027s actually just the gas burning.   Nitrogen helps because fire needs oxygen. They use the nitrogen to displace the oxygen away from the gas so that it cannot burn. After closing the valve of course, or risk reignition.\u0022, \u0022It really depends on what type of plane your are talking about and the level of auto pilot that your plane has. But regardless yes it is more difficult than a car:  Controls: Steering is far more like a boat than like car only you have elevation as well. I\u0027m sure other redditors will go into greater detail but your controls are far more complex and if you are relying on the auto pilot you need to understand how to read and program that specific autopilot exactly. You can\u0027t learn to fly a Boeing 737-400 and then go fly a Boeing 737-800 - you\u0027d have to go specifically retrain (Boeing 737NG course).  Navigation: In a car you are driving on a road with road markings and road signs and nowadays with extremely an useful GPS lady to guide you along. A huge part of flying is navigating as there\u0027s no signs up in the air to guide you along. And with weather conditions you have to learn to navigate by instrumentation alone.  Radio: This is the reason I could never be a pilot - I do not understand what is being said over the radio and you cannot fly safely without having proper communication and radio discipline. You have to be listening closely at **all** times because there\u0027s no way to fly safely without listening out for air traffic control constantly.  Safety: If your aircraft experiences any problem in air you can\u0027t simple pull over and open the hood. Therefore every single of aspect of flying involves safety checks and doublechecks. And these are not things that you can skip like when you pull your car out in the morning and you don\u0027t checked for punctures. You must follow specific checklists each flight in particular order.\u0022, \u0022On the other hand, if there \\\\*was\\\\* some sort of universal password system on all sites, hackers would know exactly what setup to target with any brute force hacking approach. Not to mention that people who are going to write down their passwords would probably otherwise have picked something really weak anyway, so it doesn\u0027t make much difference.\u0022, \u0027Most people don\u2019t drink enough water. Many of the things you listed can be attributed to dehydration which is solved by hydration.\u0027, \u0022Earth travels in a circle around the Sun. Each lap around the sun takes 1 year, or 365 days. Every day, the Earth spins 1 time. We see the sun during the day when the part of Earth we are on is facing the sun, and we cannot see the sun at night because we are facing away from it.  The moon travels in circles around the Earth just like Earth travels around the sun. However, the moon o ly takes 1 month, or about 30 days, to make 1 lap around Earth.  We can see the moon at night some days and during the day other days because the sun and moon move across our sky at different speeds, so the times we see each one don\u0027t exactly match up.  Think of two racecars going around a circle track. If one car goes a little faster than the other, we will see it pass in front of us more times than the other car. But sometimes, both cars will happen to pass in front of us at the same time.\u0022, \u0027Most people will tell you it\u2019s because the flavours infuse when left for a day or two.   I think in most cases the primary factor is that you\u2019ve had a period of \u2018detachment\u2019 from the cooking process by leaving it for a day, so you can kind of enjoy it more - as if someone else has cooked it for you.\u0027]"",""ColumnHeader"":""answer"",""DataType"":"""",""Position"":2},{""CellData"":""[\u0027What are the benefits of using transparent face shields as an alternative to
