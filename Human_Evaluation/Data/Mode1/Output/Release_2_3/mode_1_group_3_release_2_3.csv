Phones are really noisy on certain frequencies that pilots and ATCs are hearing.  So while the plane isn\u0027t going to crash... do you really want to annoy the folks trying to keep it that way?\u0022, \u0027Nitrogen gas builds up in the pockets of a joint and with enough movement these joints open up enough to allow some out, making the noise.\u0027, \u0022The other comments about alcohol being an antidiuretic hormone inhibitor are correct but a study I can\u0027t find atm found that upto 4% alcohol still hydrates you as the ~96% water you\u0027re drinking outweighs the keeping less water. And really you\u0027re only going to the loo more because you\u0027re often drinking a lot of liquid when out drinking.\u0022, \u0027There are two answers to this question: No, because light doesn\\\u0027t work that way; *or* Yes, but it\\\u0027s Complicated.  On the \u0022no\u0022 side, you have the fact that light, as a form of energy, can neither be created nor destroyed. It just moves around from place to place. (This is called the \u0022conservation of energy.\u0022 For complicated math reasons, the fact that physics works the same if you \u0022run\u0022 time forwards or backwards *requires* that energy cannot be destroyed.) So, as others have said, you could use something like a black hole to suck up light, but that\\\u0027s just shunting the light into that space, which isn\\\u0027t really the anti-lightbulb with a darkness aura around it like you are asking for.  On the \u0022yes\u0022 side, there is a very complex, very difficult way that could *theoretically* work, but it would require much more advanced technology than we possess. This is because light is made of tiny wave-packets, which we call photons. Each photon, theoretically, has a perfect equal and opposite: one with the same amplitude, but exactly reversed peaks and troughs (high and low ponts) in the wave. If these waves meet perfectly, so each high part of one wave is exactly where the corresponding low part of the other wave is, then the effect is cancelled out, and it will be as if there is no photon present at all. Then they will pass by each other and be detectable again. If--and this is a very BIG if--you could make a device that could *exactly* match the incoming photons with its own outgoing photons, you could make an anti-lightbulb that would create a halo of unlit space around itself. This would be very, very difficult however, and we probably do not have computers good enough to calculate which light needs to go where *fast enough* to make one work, even in an extremely rigidly controlled environment.  However, while doing this with *light* is very hard, doing it with *sound* is actually (sort of) possible! As an example, think of being at a concert, where the same sound waves are being sent out of two different speaker units. If those speaker units are positioned correctly, there will be points where the sound waves from one speaker will exactly cancel out the sound waves of the other speaker, meaning a microphone at that point would hear (effectively) silence. The effect is not perfect silence normally, because in the real world, objects have volume, whereas the place where the waves cancel out is (in theory) a single point. But you can absolutely experience these points of silence in the real world! You can also get the exact opposite phenomena, where sound gets reinforced to become louder than it would be otherwise, because the two waves *stack* their high parts right on top of each other (same for the low parts).  The formal physics term for waves that cancel out is \u0022destructive interference\u0022 (the two waves combine to make a \u0022weaker\u0022 wave), and for waves that amplify it\\\u0027s called \u0022constructive interference\u0022 (the two waves combine to make a \u0022stronger\u0022 wave).\u0027, \u0022Let\u0027s say you were called up to testify in your own trial. Without such a protection, you could either...  - Be honest, and get yourself convicted. - Lie, and have a perjury charge added on. - Refuse to answer, and be held in contempt of court.\u0022, \u0022Coffee creamer is shelf-stable and light...much easier to store, much more portable. Milk needs a fridge.   I have absolutely no idea why you\u0027d use \\\\*both\\\\* in one drink, unless you just really like that particular flavour profile.\u0022, \u0027Dramatic blood pressure drops will make a person unconscious. If the disconnect between the heart and brain is large enough (like severe damage to the heart or sliced neck arteries) the person goes unconscious before they might be declared officially dead\u2026. But the time between the two would be maybe a few seconds.\u0027, \u0022It\u0027s because you\u0027re listening to audio mixed for a 5.1 or higher surround sound system and your TV is 2.0. 5.1 and higher expect a center channel for voice which your TV doesn\u0027t have.  Your TV likely has settings to try to mitigate this, or you can check in the language settings of your streaming service or DVD for a 2.1 surround option.\u0022, \u0022fun fact, in Afrikaans we use \u0027e\u0027 instead of \u0027s\u0027 (most of the times):  hond = honde  muis = muise  tand = tande  deur = deure\u0022, \u0022The guy under answered the thickness question, when we use many wires it\u0027s because we use them for connecting devices that communicates, like in Ethernet cable we have 2 twisted pairs, many cables use more then one line because you may want to sand not only power but data\u0022, \u0022Not an expert so ill give you an educated guess until someone gives better details.  I\u0027ve seen some of those pictures a long time ago but i dont remember super well.  Anyways its just like X-ray. Its something that pierces your clothes but bounces back from the skin sonar style. So yeah its not a clear picture but a 3d model of the person. Still very good quality. You can see peenises, titties etc.  Wear iron armor beneath your clothes and noone will ever see you naked.\u0022, \u0027To show you the video your computer has to download it. A video downloader will see a video file being downloaded and save it to a more permanent folder. For non YouTube ones it might just grab any file it sees, which can lead to you downloading ads.\u0027, \u0027Do you mean how do they develop the skills to be professional or what defines them as professional? The answer to the former is discipline and practice. The answer to the later is that they are sponsored and between sponsorships and winnings from tournaments make some or all of their living wage by gaming competitively.\u0027, \u0022Aero = air, dynamics = movement.  [Aerodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics) is the study of how air movement affects objects, in other words, how different shapes of objects will fall or fly through air, and how air will move around these objects, and drag at them.  When you\u0027re skydiving, gravity pulls you down, and the air hits your body and pushes it.  You can move your arms and legs to turn, tumble, fall slightly faster or slower, etc.  If you\u0027re wearing a [wing suit](https://previews.123rf.com/images/victorkozlov/victorkozlov2001/victorkozlov200100902/138222924-djibouti-extreme-men-in-wing-suit-templet-skydiving-men-in-parashute-simulator-of-free-fall-.jpg) you can glide a little bit better (rather than just falling like a rock), and the way the air interacts with the wing surfaces of the suit is part of aerodynamics.\u0022, \u0022Because they always planned to do so.  The entire plan of Hitler\u0027s was to invade the Soviet Union and conquer the heavily populated eastern parts.  He then planned to kill most of the population through starvation, move in Germans to all be farmers and have the surviving Soviet population be used as slave labour.  Germany needed to invade the USSR.  All that ECONOMIC MIRACLES of the 1930s was on huge amounts of debt.  The only thing that was going to pay for it was conquest.  The Germans plundered as much as they could from every country that they conquered to pay off their debtors.\u0022]"",""ColumnHeader"":""answer"",""DataType"":"""",""Position"":2},{""CellData"":""[\u0027Why might a transplanted organ be considered a foreign tissue by the immune system?\u0027,

If these waves meet perfectly, so each high part of one wave is exactly where the corresponding low part of the other wave is, then the effect is cancelled out, and it will be as if there is no photon present at all. Then they will pass by each other and be detectable again. If--and this is a very BIG if--you could make a device that could *exactly* match the incoming photons with its own outgoing photons, you could make an anti-lightbulb that would create a halo of unlit space around itself. This would be very, very difficult however, and we probably do not have computers good enough to calculate which light needs to go where *fast enough* to make one work, even in an extremely rigidly controlled environment.  However, while doing this with *light* is very hard, doing it with *sound* is actually (sort of) possible! As an example, think of being at a concert, where the same sound waves are being sent out of two different speaker units. If those speaker units are positioned correctly, there will be points where the sound waves from one speaker will exactly cancel out the sound waves of the other speaker, meaning a microphone at that point would hear (effectively) silence. The effect is not perfect silence normally, because in the real world, objects have volume, whereas the place where the waves cancel out is (in theory) a single point. But you can absolutely experience these points of silence in the real world! You can also get the exact opposite phenomena, where sound gets reinforced to become louder than it would be otherwise, because the two waves *stack* their high parts right on top of each other (same for the low parts).  The formal physics term for waves that cancel out is \u0022destructive interference\u0022 (the two waves combine to make a \u0022weaker\u0022 wave), and for waves that amplify it\\\u0027s called \u0022constructive interference\u0022 (the two waves combine to make a \u0022stronger\u0022 wave).\u0027, \u0022Let\u0027s say you were called up to testify in your own trial. Without such a protection, you could either...  - Be honest, and get yourself convicted. - Lie, and have a perjury charge added on. - Refuse to answer, and be held in contempt of court.\u0022, \u0022Coffee creamer is shelf-stable and light...much easier to store, much more portable. Milk needs a fridge.   I have absolutely no idea why you\u0027d use \\\\*both\\\\* in one drink, unless you just really like that particular flavour profile.\u0022, \u0027Dramatic blood pressure drops will make a person unconscious. If the disconnect between the heart and brain is large enough (like severe damage to the heart or sliced neck arteries) the person goes unconscious before they might be declared officially dead\u2026. But the time between the two would be maybe a few seconds.\u0027, \u0022It\u0027s because you\u0027re listening to audio mixed for a 5.1 or higher surround sound system and your TV is 2.0. 5.1 and higher expect a center channel for voice which your TV doesn\u0027t have.  Your TV likely has settings to try to mitigate this, or you can check in the language settings of your streaming service or DVD for a 2.1 surround option.\u0022, \u0022fun fact, in Afrikaans we use \u0027e\u0027 instead of \u0027s\u0027 (most of the times):  hond = honde  muis = muise  tand = tande  deur = deure\u0022, \u0022The guy under answered the thickness question, when we use many wires it\u0027s because we use them for connecting devices that communicates, like in Ethernet cable we have 2 twisted pairs, many cables use more then one line because you may want to sand not only power but data\u0022, \u0022Not an expert so ill give you an educated guess until someone gives better details.  I\u0027ve seen some of those pictures a long time ago but i dont remember super well.  Anyways its just like X-ray. Its something that pierces your clothes but bounces back from the skin sonar style. So yeah its not a clear picture but a 3d model of the person. Still very good quality. You can see peenises, titties etc.  Wear iron armor beneath your clothes and noone will ever see you naked.\u0022, \u0027To show you the video your computer has to download it. A video downloader will see a video file being downloaded and save it to a more permanent folder. For non YouTube ones it might just grab any file it sees, which can lead to you downloading ads.\u0027, \u0027Do you mean how do they develop the skills to be professional or what defines them as professional? The answer to the former is discipline and practice. The answer to the later is that they are sponsored and between sponsorships and winnings from tournaments make some or all of their living wage by gaming competitively.\u0027, \u0022Aero = air, dynamics = movement.  [Aerodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics) is the study of how air movement affects objects, in other words, how different shapes of objects will fall or fly through air, and how air will move around these objects, and drag at them.  When you\u0027re skydiving, gravity pulls you down, and the air hits your body and pushes it.  You can move your arms and legs to turn, tumble, fall slightly faster or slower, etc.  If you\u0027re wearing a [wing suit](https://previews.123rf.com/images/victorkozlov/victorkozlov2001/victorkozlov200100902/138222924-djibouti-extreme-men-in-wing-suit-templet-skydiving-men-in-parashute-simulator-of-free-fall-.jpg) you can glide a little bit better (rather than just falling like a rock), and the way the air interacts with the wing surfaces of the suit is part of aerodynamics.\u0022, \u0022Because they always planned to do so.  The entire plan of Hitler\u0027s was to invade the Soviet Union and conquer the heavily populated eastern parts.  He then planned to kill most of the population through starvation, move in Germans to all be farmers and have the surviving Soviet population be used as slave labour.  Germany needed to invade the USSR.  All that ECONOMIC MIRACLES of the 1930s was on huge amounts of debt.  The only thing that was going to pay for it was conquest.  The Germans plundered as much as they could from every country that they conquered to pay off their debtors.\u0022]"",""ColumnHeader"":""answer"",""DataType"":"""",""Position"":2},{""CellData"":""[\u0027Why might a transplanted organ be considered a foreign tissue by the immune system?\u0027,
