10429,ELI5 How can there be a global water shortage if virtually all of our water is recycled naturally?,"Because global warming is changing weather patterns around the world which means less rain and snow in places where it used to be. It's not that there's less water overall, it's just that changing weather patterns changes where the water is going, which is places were it's either not needed or inaccessible.   For example, less winter snow in the Rocky Mountains means less spring and summer water in the Colorado River watershed which provides water for much of The Southwestern U.S., eventually emptying in the Pacific. At the same time, Typhoons in the pacific are getting bigger and more frequent, so there's more water being dumped back into the ocean. In other words, water that used to fall as snow in the Rockies is now falling as rain in the Pacific Ocean where it's unusable. That's a simplistic explanation but you get the drift.",How does the increased frequency of extreme weather events affect water distribution?
19848,"ELI5: How are credit/debit cards with chips more secure than others when most card readers have a ""Bypass PIN"" option that allows the transaction to go through without any additional verification? It seems to me that this is less secure than an old chipless card that at least requires a PIN.","The chip and/or the PIN are a means of verifying the transaction is legit.  On a card without the chip, the only data is its number, the expiration date, and maybe the verification code on the back. The magnetic stripe is usually just the card number. These kinds of terminals require the PIN because (hopefully) only the authorized cardholder knows that PIN. These cards are easy to duplicate so we NEED extra security measures.  Cards with a chip, on the other hand, are a lot harder to replicate. The chip is actually a tiny computer that does some math on some inputs and generates numbers in a way that isn't easy to guess even if you see it done for a few thousand inputs. The bank who issues the card knows the secret information that makes it possible to predict the numbers. So, oversimplified, when you use a chip reader, the terminal gives the chip some inputs, gets the chip's result, then sends the inputs and the results to the bank. The bank verifies that the inputs should produce that output on your chip. So in a way, the chip IS the PIN, but it's more secure than that because you can't accidentally give someone knowledge that makes them able to replicate your chip.  It's probably possible to copy a card with a chip, but it would take a high degree of sophistication and someone would have to physically steal your card to do it. You can't reproduce the chip from observing a single read, and in theory even seeing hundreds of thousands of input/output wouldn't be useful. Because it's incredibly close to impossible to duplicate these chips, when a terminal uses the chip as an ID you don't have to use a PIN. The assumption is it means someone would've had to have stolen your actual card and you'd probably notice that much more quickly than it takes to figure out someone's skimmed a traditional card.",How does the tamper-resistant technology in chip cards prevent unauthorized access or modifications?
10118,ELI5: how is the United States in debt?,"The public holds over $22 trillion of the national debt.1 Foreign governments hold a large portion of the public debt, while the rest is owned by U.S. banks and investors, the Federal Reserve, state and local governments, mutual funds, pensions funds, insurance companies, and savings bonds. China being the most popular foreign country to point out. Sure we could refuse to pay- but then why would someone loan us money next time we need help if we prove we won't pay it back? It would also make the savings bonds of millions of Americans worthless- which would collapse their retirement goals. Plus that would definitely hurt us in our efforts of international trade.",What are the expected benefits of using a credit-based economic model?
9121,[eli5] Can we heat pots and pans with direct electricity?,there used to be pots and pans that u plugged in and they would heat up and all that. idk if there still are. they were rather awkward to clean tbh.   maybe thats the crux of it. it would be reall quote difficult to clean it like a normal dish so its function is overshadowed by its use upkeep,What types of conductive materials are typically used in resistive heating elements?
5536,eli5 Can you make perpetual stew in a crock pot without getting sick?,"There’s been a few historical perpetual pots of food over the years. One in Bangkok I think was a few hundred years old. As long as they are kept at food safe temperatures and enough is being added and taken, it’s possible.",Why are root vegetables and hardy greens recommended for a perpetual stew?
28,ELI5: Why aren’t there insects the size of man or larger?,"They don’t breath the same way mammals do. They have tubes in various parts of their body that expose their circulatory system to air where it absorbs oxygen. Because they don’t inhale, they air limited in size by the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. Which is why they used to be bigger in past eras when there was more oxygen in the atmosphere.",How does gravity affect the biomechanics of larger insects differently than smaller ones?
6502,ELI5 how our brains notice when something has changed?,"The brain runs a LOT of processes sub-consciously, that is, you are not even aware of them going unless some of them turn up something that the brain thinks should be brought to conscious attention. The brain has a mental picture of your room stored for reference, and when it sees something has changed, it will sound an alarm bringing this fact to consciousness, because it’s pretty important for safety reasons, obviously.",How does the novelty detection system operate in the brain?
19975,ELI5: Why is deflation worse than inflation?,"Why would I pay $1000 for a TV today when it will be cheaper tomorrow.   Obviously not that simple.  But if people don't spend money, shops go broke, people lose jobs etc",What are the mechanisms by which deflation can cause a credit crunch?
19912,"ELI5: Considering that more calorie dense foods weigh less and have more calories while less calorie dense foods weigh more and have less calories, and the conservation of matter, how more calories means more weight?","Conservation of matter:  (weight of food) - (weight of poop) - (weight of pee) = weight gained by your body?    Actually, a bit more complicated, because you breathe in O2 and expel CO2 (so you lose carbons  from the ""weight of food"").  You also sweat out some of the water you just ingested.","How does the body metabolize fats, carbohydrates, and proteins for energy?"
21245,"eli5: why aren’t animals massive? Elephants are huge, and they seem to be doing great, so why are other animals so small?","Here’s the short short answer. Big animals need A LOT of energy. Like a ridiculous amount. An entire ecosystem of massive organisms. Just couldn’t work.  Most would starve. But a massive ecosystem of tiny organisms is possible. They require a lot of energy done their body size, but not overall - and so we get lots of smaller species, that don’t store much energy, like mice.",Why is it that evolutionary pressures generally favor smaller animals over larger ones?
296,ELI5: Why can't they make CPUs bigger if heat dissipation is a problem?,"Say you increase the size by a factor of 2 in both dimensions. That would result in quadruple the distance between two components - and while electrons do travel with very high speeds (not quite light speed, but close, relatively speaking) with the amount of electrons being moved you'd have a much slower CPU in the end.  That's why the actual transistors are getting smaller and smaller - so you can pack them more densely and reduce the distance between them, to make faster CPUs.",In what ways are current semiconductor manufacturing techniques limited when it comes to making larger CPUs?
19365,"ELI5: when someone shouts, why do people say that they have ""Thin walls""? Even if they *are* thin, if there aren't any cracks or anything, sound cannot travel beyond them and will be trapped within them, right?? I dont understand if it has anything to do with thickness, I think it's about if there","Sound travels through solid objects, some much better than others.  Stand in a closed bank safe and scream your head off, no one outside is going to hear you.  Wrap yourself in tissue paper and talk normally and people will hear you the same as if you weren't wrapped up.  Apartment walls fall somewhere in between, with some being thick and solid with multiple layers of plaster and insulation that do a really good job absorbing (and dissipating) sound waves without transmitting them through the wall.  Others are hollow spaces with a thin sheet of drywall on either side, and these tend to do a really poor job of absorbing the sound waves.  These ""thin walls"" make it easier to hear what's happening on the other side.",What measures can be taken to improve the acoustic properties of thin walls?
4543,ELI5: Why (or how?) did mint become the ‘gold standard’ for oral health?,"Toothpaste has tin in it, and tin has a bad metallic taste.  To overpower that, it takes a strong flavor, like mint or peppermint.  Other than cinnamon, there aren't many low cost flavors that will cover the tin taste.",Why is maintaining saliva production crucial for oral health?
7824,"ELI5 What does it mean to say that ""electromagnetic radiation is a wavelength that is inversely proportional to its frequency""?","In a nutshell, the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength.  Since frequency is a measurement of how many times an electromagnetic wave passes a fixed point per second, that means that shorter waves are going to pass more often, and therefore have a higher frequency.",What are some applications of high-frequency waves like gamma rays?
11314,ELI5: What are the questions scientists are trying to answer for the cure to cancer?,Curing cancer is like trying to develope a weapon that when fired into a crowd will only kill terrorists. Cancer cells are still your own cells and mostly behave like normal cells (in terms of what kills them). So the big question scientists have to find an answer too is: what differentiates cancer cells enough from healthy cells to kill them off without killing the rest of the body with them.,What role does bioinformatics play in predicting cancer behavior and tailoring personalized treatment plans?
4574,ELI5: How can our ears know if a sound is coming from up high or down low?,"Our ears are an odd shape, so the sound bounces around differently, depending on where the sound is coming from.   When you're very young, your brain figures out that if a sound sounds a certain way, it's probably coming from a certain direction.",What is the significance of frequency spectrum analysis in vertical sound localization?
13078,"ELI5: the anti-work movement. How does the world keep turning, so to speak, if work is abolished?","with universal basic income, people can still take a normal job as bonus money, or work on their passion projects, or be poor with basic needs met.",How would social welfare systems support voluntary and passion-driven contributions in society?
5153,ELI5: What is a dynamic volume?,"It's when a partition on a physical drive (when your computer says C: or D:, for instance), can spread to one or more drive physical drive to fits its needs for size and speed. For instance, if your D: Drive is across an HDD and an SSD, you get a dynamic volume that can take advantage of both as needed, but is also dependent on the presence and survivability of both woth work.  However, it does not necessarily have to be on multiple physical drives, as it can increase its own size on the same drive as it needs to, automatically.   Basically, a dynamic drive is a drive that adjusts its specs to fit what it needs.",What is the significance of dynamic resizing in dynamic volumes?
3193,Eli5: How and why do the prices of stocks rise and fall?,"Supply and demand.  Imagine there is 100 of a thing that people want, and 100 people want it. The supply and demand are equal so the price stays the same (equal amount of sales and buys)  Now if only 10 people want it, the price will drop (more selling than buying)  However if there's 1000 people trying to buy, the price will increase (more buying than selling)",Why might strong earnings lead to an increase in a stock's price?
8836,ELI5: How does night vision work?,"Basically it uses small amounts of infrared light that is reflected off objects naturally, then it converts them using optoelectric image enhancement changing it from the invisible infared into the green light show that is placed right in front of you. The shitty thing about night vision is if you are moving with it your depth perception is shit. They have also have some newer types of night vision that use other digitial enhancment but I never played with those so idk how those work.","What advantages do digital enhancements like recording, zooming, and overlaying information provide in night vision devices?"
