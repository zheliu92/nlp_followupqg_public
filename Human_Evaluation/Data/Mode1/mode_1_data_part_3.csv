23660,ELI5: Do patients with transplants from other people have to take immunosuppressants for rest of their lives or does their body adapt over time?,"Immediately after for around a year I took a medium dose of immunosuppressants, but my donor was a family member so the match was pretty good, people who receive a lesser match will go on a higher dose straight after.   Slowly the doctors will reduce the amount to balance the rejection level to find the happy medium between rejection and your bodies acceptance of the organ.  I’m three years into a kidney transplant and take quite a low dose now. And luckily have had zero rejection, people can go into an episode of rejection and at that point you get to the hospital as fast as you can, they dose you back up with a massive amount of anti rejection drugs and immunosuppressants and then once the rejection is back under control, start the whole balancing act again.  Source: I have 3 kidneys, two that I was born with and a third I borrowed from a family member.",Why might a transplanted organ be considered a foreign tissue by the immune system?
22221,"ELI5: When was the first airport developed that was available for the common citizen to use, and what were they like?",The first commercial airports were actually for lighter-than-air aircraft.... blimps! They were established in Germany and german blimps (Zepplins) were used as passenger liners,What were the key features of early aviation pioneers' airfields like College Park Airport?
8927,ELI5: How does perfect pitch work? Can you learn it?,"For people with perfect pitch it's as natural as for you to say ""This is blue. This is red."" They just know straight away. You can not learn this skill, but you can train yourself to remember a pitch in different ways, eg I can hum a note and I know its always approx G. Then just quickly transpose what I'm hearing.",Why is it generally harder for older individuals to develop perfect pitch?
18811,ELI5: What are those little bumps you sometimes get in your mouth and why do they form?,"Could be herpes. You personally might be a chaste and upstanding citizen, but most of humanity after a certain age carries some form of herpes.","What are cold sores, and how do they form from the herpes simplex virus?"
11686,"ELI5: Why is it convention for websites to use boxes for questions with multiple answers, but dots for questions with single answers?","They are two different types of controls.  The check boxes are independent, and you can check multiple boxes.  The dots are called radio buttons, and when they're grouped together you can only check one.  Checking another will uncheck the previously checked one.  Since that functionality has already been built into the controls, it means less coding for the web designer.",How does the use of checkboxes and radio buttons adhere to accessibility principles?
7153,ELI5 what is the worst that is likely to happen if no one on a flight puts their phone on airplane mode?,You'll annoy some Pilots and Air Traffic Controllers.  Phones are really noisy on certain frequencies that pilots and ATCs are hearing.  So while the plane isn't going to crash... do you really want to annoy the folks trying to keep it that way?,Why are takeoff and landing considered critical phases in terms of potential interference?
17377,ELI5: What is happening when a chiropractor cracks a patient’s neck/back?,"Nitrogen gas builds up in the pockets of a joint and with enough movement these joints open up enough to allow some out, making the noise.",Why is proprioception important for physical stability?
15613,ELI5: how does alcohol dehydrate a person? Is it through the actual act of drinking or that it makes you urinate more and you don’t replenish with water?,The other comments about alcohol being an antidiuretic hormone inhibitor are correct but a study I can't find atm found that upto 4% alcohol still hydrates you as the ~96% water you're drinking outweighs the keeping less water. And really you're only going to the loo more because you're often drinking a lot of liquid when out drinking.,"How does the body normally maintain electrolyte balance, and how does alcohol disrupt this process?"
10466,ELI5: Can there be a machine that’s an “anti-lightbulb”?,"There are two answers to this question: No, because light doesn't work that way; *or* Yes, but it's Complicated.  On the ""no"" side, you have the fact that light, as a form of energy, can neither be created nor destroyed. It just moves around from place to place. (This is called the ""conservation of energy."" For complicated math reasons, the fact that physics works the same if you ""run"" time forwards or backwards *requires* that energy cannot be destroyed.) So, as others have said, you could use something like a black hole to suck up light, but that's just shunting the light into that space, which isn't really the anti-lightbulb with a darkness aura around it like you are asking for.  On the ""yes"" side, there is a very complex, very difficult way that could *theoretically* work, but it would require much more advanced technology than we possess. This is because light is made of tiny wave-packets, which we call photons. Each photon, theoretically, has a perfect equal and opposite: one with the same amplitude, but exactly reversed peaks and troughs (high and low ponts) in the wave. If these waves meet perfectly, so each high part of one wave is exactly where the corresponding low part of the other wave is, then the effect is cancelled out, and it will be as if there is no photon present at all. Then they will pass by each other and be detectable again. If--and this is a very BIG if--you could make a device that could *exactly* match the incoming photons with its own outgoing photons, you could make an anti-lightbulb that would create a halo of unlit space around itself. This would be very, very difficult however, and we probably do not have computers good enough to calculate which light needs to go where *fast enough* to make one work, even in an extremely rigidly controlled environment.  However, while doing this with *light* is very hard, doing it with *sound* is actually (sort of) possible! As an example, think of being at a concert, where the same sound waves are being sent out of two different speaker units. If those speaker units are positioned correctly, there will be points where the sound waves from one speaker will exactly cancel out the sound waves of the other speaker, meaning a microphone at that point would hear (effectively) silence. The effect is not perfect silence normally, because in the real world, objects have volume, whereas the place where the waves cancel out is (in theory) a single point. But you can absolutely experience these points of silence in the real world! You can also get the exact opposite phenomena, where sound gets reinforced to become louder than it would be otherwise, because the two waves *stack* their high parts right on top of each other (same for the low parts).  The formal physics term for waves that cancel out is ""destructive interference"" (the two waves combine to make a ""weaker"" wave), and for waves that amplify it's called ""constructive interference"" (the two waves combine to make a ""stronger"" wave).","What is meant by ""wav-packets"" in the context of photons?"
12737,ELI5: why does the fifth amendment exist?,"Let's say you were called up to testify in your own trial. Without such a protection, you could either...  - Be honest, and get yourself convicted. - Lie, and have a perjury charge added on. - Refuse to answer, and be held in contempt of court.",What role does due process play in the Fifth Amendment?
18613,ELI5: What is the point/difference of using coffee creamer instead of milk?,"Coffee creamer is shelf-stable and light...much easier to store, much more portable. Milk needs a fridge.   I have absolutely no idea why you'd use \*both\* in one drink, unless you just really like that particular flavour profile.",Can you describe the types of sweeteners typically used in coffee creamers?
9000,ELI5: How instant is instant death?,Dramatic blood pressure drops will make a person unconscious. If the disconnect between the heart and brain is large enough (like severe damage to the heart or sliced neck arteries) the person goes unconscious before they might be declared officially dead…. But the time between the two would be maybe a few seconds.,How do forensic pathologists assess the extent and nature of injuries to align with legal standards of instant death?
7313,ELI5: Why is music in movies always so loud?,"It's because you're listening to audio mixed for a 5.1 or higher surround sound system and your TV is 2.0. 5.1 and higher expect a center channel for voice which your TV doesn't have.  Your TV likely has settings to try to mitigate this, or you can check in the language settings of your streaming service or DVD for a 2.1 surround option.","Why is it important to balance dialogue, sound effects, and music in movie audio mixing?"
18317,"ELI5: How did ""s"" become the letter that pluralises nouns (""one apple, ten apples"") in so many languages?","fun fact, in Afrikaans we use 'e' instead of 's' (most of the times):  hond = honde  muis = muise  tand = tande  deur = deure","Why did the English language favor the ""-as"" ending in Old English?"
15446,ELI5: Why we use different size of wire sizes and quantities for different applicants?,"The guy under answered the thickness question, when we use many wires it's because we use them for connecting devices that communicates, like in Ethernet cable we have 2 twisted pairs, many cables use more then one line because you may want to sand not only power but data",What are the potential consequences of using undersized wires in electrical systems?
1039,ELI5 how do the cameras work that can see through clothing?,"Not an expert so ill give you an educated guess until someone gives better details.  I've seen some of those pictures a long time ago but i dont remember super well.  Anyways its just like X-ray. Its something that pierces your clothes but bounces back from the skin sonar style. So yeah its not a clear picture but a 3d model of the person. Still very good quality. You can see peenises, titties etc.  Wear iron armor beneath your clothes and noone will ever see you naked.",What kind of materials can terahertz waves penetrate?
12127,eli5 How do video downloaders work?,"To show you the video your computer has to download it. A video downloader will see a video file being downloaded and save it to a more permanent folder. For non YouTube ones it might just grab any file it sees, which can lead to you downloading ads.",How do video downloaders analyze network traffic to capture video content?
14943,Eli5 How do players go pro into esports?,Do you mean how do they develop the skills to be professional or what defines them as professional? The answer to the former is discipline and practice. The answer to the later is that they are sponsored and between sponsorships and winnings from tournaments make some or all of their living wage by gaming competitively.,What are some key elements that mentorship might cover for aspiring professional esports players?
6082,ELI5: What is aerodynamics and does it play a part when skydiving?,"Aero = air, dynamics = movement.  [Aerodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics) is the study of how air movement affects objects, in other words, how different shapes of objects will fall or fly through air, and how air will move around these objects, and drag at them.  When you're skydiving, gravity pulls you down, and the air hits your body and pushes it.  You can move your arms and legs to turn, tumble, fall slightly faster or slower, etc.  If you're wearing a [wing suit](https://previews.123rf.com/images/victorkozlov/victorkozlov2001/victorkozlov200100902/138222924-djibouti-extreme-men-in-wing-suit-templet-skydiving-men-in-parashute-simulator-of-free-fall-.jpg) you can glide a little bit better (rather than just falling like a rock), and the way the air interacts with the wing surfaces of the suit is part of aerodynamics.",How do aerodynamic principles apply to the design and deployment of parachutes?
16021,Eli5: Why did Germany betray Russia in ww2?,"Because they always planned to do so.  The entire plan of Hitler's was to invade the Soviet Union and conquer the heavily populated eastern parts.  He then planned to kill most of the population through starvation, move in Germans to all be farmers and have the surviving Soviet population be used as slave labour.  Germany needed to invade the USSR.  All that ECONOMIC MIRACLES of the 1930s was on huge amounts of debt.  The only thing that was going to pay for it was conquest.  The Germans plundered as much as they could from every country that they conquered to pay off their debtors.",What economic conditions in Germany during the 1930s led to the need for conquest?
