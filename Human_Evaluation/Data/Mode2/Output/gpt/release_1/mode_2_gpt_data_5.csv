Registers are available in many types of ICs and come in many varieties. For example, you can have status registers, control registers, data registers etc. The reason to give them names is because the function of these registers have to be very carefully explained in the data sheet for the ICs and it is just convenient to give them a name.  Registers are typically not shared (since they are implemented internal to an IC). Unless you are poking deep into the HW and chips (eg writing drivers etc), there is rarely any reason to interact with HW registers (and attempts to change register settings without knowing EXACTLY how they will change the function of the hardware is very unproductive)  Go pick up a few data sheets of some simple control ICs and you can see how they explain register settings etc.\u0027, \u0027Registers are simply active data storage areas.

If so how is that achieved?   - Are there registers that can hold data through a reboot cycle?\u0027, \u0027Thanks for the response. What are HW registers?
