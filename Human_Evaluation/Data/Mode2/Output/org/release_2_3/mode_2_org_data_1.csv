This is a misconception.  The reason why piglets don\u0027t tan is because they don\u0027t have any fur to protect them from sun.  They have no natural tanning glands.\u0022, \u0027Do they have any way to protect their eyes from sunburn?\u0027, \u0027I see.

What?   What did you mean by that?  \u003EThe dwarves fight?  What about the other races?  The other races are in the other books, but they\u0027re not in the war.  The dwarf\u0027s in the middle of a conflict that\u0027s not even mentioned in the story.  Why did they get left out?  Because they\u0027re insignificant in the overall story.\u0022, \u0027\u003EIn a nutshell:  The sound waves are received by a microphone.  The microphone vibrates, and transforms the vibrations into an electrical signal.    This is how our voice is transmitted to other speakers, and how our words are received.  How does the electrical signal get converted into a vibration?\u0027, \u0027So how does the electrical signal get transmitted to the receiver?\u0027, \u0027Is there any way to reverse this?\u0027, \u0027Thanks for your answer!  So, if I say \u0022Hello\u0022 and \u0022Hi\u0022 in a loud voice, it will be heard by the receiver, and then turn into a vibration?\u0027, \u0027So basically, you need to kill dragons to get to the end?\u0027, \u0027What is the endgame?\u0027, \u0027How does it work?\u0027, \u0022Ohh so it\u0027s like a video game but you can craft things in it?\u0022, \u0027\u003EYou can write down the message or take a photo of the screen.

This is why you put pressure on a wound or you tourniquet the area so that blood just can\u0027t flow to that extremity.  This also means platelets are going to clot and block where you are bleeding to eventually stabilize.\u003CQUS\u003E\u0022, \u0027How does the heart know how much blood to pump?\u0027, \u0027Thanks for your answer!

What is a quaternions?\u0022, \u0027So if I have a vector of 3d lines and rotate it once, it will turn into a 3d quaternion?\u0027, \u0022So if I have 7 points and rotate them left to right, how do I know that I\u0027m in the correct quadrant?\u0022, \u0027I think that\\\u0027s the key.    I\\\u0027m not sure what you mean by \u00223 components\u0022.   The rotation is defined by the third component.  The fourth component is used to determine the degree of rotation.  So, if you have a 3d vector, you can rotate it in any direction.  But if you want to rotate it out to a 4d vector you need to use a fourth component.\u0027, \u0022I see.

Does this mean that the sound is not being played correctly?\u0027, \u0027What about the Green Needle?\u0027, \u0027So the question is, why does the sound have a hanging frequency?\u0027, \u0027But why does the background frequency hang?\u0027, \u0027How does it work?\u0027, \u0027Thanks for your answer!    But what about the Ben 10 song?  Does it have any relation to the real world?\u0027, \u0022So if I see a white light in the air, it\u0027s not reflecting from another source?\u0022, \u0027How do we know that it\u2019s not reflecting from another source?\u0027, \u0022So if the object is so hot that it\u0027s absorbing the light, then how is it still reflecting?\u0022, \u0027Is it possible to heat a torch up to a certain temperature and still see the light?\u0027, \u0027I see, but what about the black body radiation?\u0027, \u0022\u003EFor serious injury this can basically kill you because you eventually don\u0027t have enough blood to keep the heart or brain Alive.    This is why you put pressure on a wound or you tourniquet the area so that blood just can\u0027t flow to that extremity.  This also means platelets are going to clot and block where you are bleeding to eventually stabilize.\u003CQUS\u003E\u0022, \u0027How does the heart know how much blood to pump?\u0027, \u0027Thanks for your answer!    Does this mean that if I were to lose a lot of blood, my heart would beat faster to pump it to my brain?\u0027, \u0027What about head injuries?\u0027, \u0022\u003EIf you track 7 points, that\u0027s a 7-dimensional vector! Way more complicated than tiny little 4D quaternion.   What is a quaternions?\u0022, \u0027So if I have a vector of 3d lines and rotate it once, it will turn into a 3d quaternion?\u0027, \u0022So if I have 7 points and rotate them left to right, how do I know that I\u0027m in the correct quadrant?\u0022, \u0027I think that\\\u0027s the key.    I\\\u0027m not sure what you mean by \u00223 components\u0022.   The rotation is defined by the third component.  The fourth component is used to determine the degree of rotation.  So, if you have a 3d vector, you can rotate it in any direction.  But if you want to rotate it out to a 4d vector you need to use a fourth component.\u0027, \u0022I see. So it\u0027s just a rotation problem?\u0022]"",""ColumnHeader"":""generated_follow_up"",""DataType"":"""",""Position"":5}],""Position"":2,""Participants"":1}","{""Data"":{""taskData"":[{""3000_1_error"":{""No
