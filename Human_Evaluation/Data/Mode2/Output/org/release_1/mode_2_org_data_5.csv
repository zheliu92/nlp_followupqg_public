Registers are available in many types of ICs and come in many varieties. For example, you can have status registers, control registers, data registers etc. The reason to give them names is because the function of these registers have to be very carefully explained in the data sheet for the ICs and it is just convenient to give them a name.  Registers are typically not shared (since they are implemented internal to an IC). Unless you are poking deep into the HW and chips (eg writing drivers etc), there is rarely any reason to interact with HW registers (and attempts to change register settings without knowing EXACTLY how they will change the function of the hardware is very unproductive)  Go pick up a few data sheets of some simple control ICs and you can see how they explain register settings etc.\u0027, \u0027Registers are simply active data storage areas.

I\\\u0027m not sure if you\\\u0027re aware of this, but it\\\u0027s a Turing test that\\\u0027s used by Google to check whether you can solve a captcha.   It\\\u0027s a bit like a video game where you have to solve a video-game-like game to see if you can beat the computer.  There are a few ways to get around these, there are programs out there who are able to solve these tests successfully and seem human, but there have also been instances where humans have been paid to solve Captchas all day long.  I don\\\u0027t know if you\\\u0027ve seen the videos of the people solving the tests, but they\\\u0027re pretty impressive and it\\\u0027s not something you\\\u0027d expect a computer to be able to do.  Also, there have been cases where robots have been used to solve the tests as well, but those were pretty rare.  The Turing test is a bit of a stretch, but I think it\\\u0027s still a good test.  For example, there\\\u0027s a video of a bot solving a captcha using a series of images of stop signs.  It uses a combination of a human and a computer, and a series that uses a series (similar to how you\\\u0027d use a video clip to check if you are a human or a robot.  You can watch the video here:   The bot uses a computer and a human to solve it, and then shows you the results.  And there\\\u0027s also a video where a bot shows off the results and then asks you to watch it again.  This is a little bit like the Turing test, except instead of a video, you have a series where a computer shows you a series or a series and then a series in which you have the choice of whether to watch the videos again.\u0027, \u0027What about self driving cars?\u0027, \u0027Is there a way to fool the coder?\u0027, \u0027Can you explain the reasoning behind
