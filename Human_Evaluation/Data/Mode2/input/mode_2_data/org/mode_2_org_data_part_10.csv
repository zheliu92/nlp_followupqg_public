The answer is that the required to do this is greater than the energy you get out of it, so you'd burn more gas than you get. Which could be fine if you are using a green process, but at that point it's not particularly productive since you're using more than you're capturing.    >Consider -   If you could use a green fuel to capture carbon, would you still be burning more gas?   The answer to that is yes, but only if you're not using a fossil fuel.  If we could use renewable energy, would we still be using more gas to produce the same amount of carbon?
