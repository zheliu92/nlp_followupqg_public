What you're missing is that I and V in that equation can't vary independently if the circuit itself is fixed. Since V = IR, and R is fixed, reducing the current necessarily means reducing the voltage. If you, say, halve the current, then you also halve the voltage, which means your new power loss is (1/2 \\* original current)(1/2 \\* original voltage) = 1/4 the original power loss, just as the formula I^(2)R would suggest.
