The tl;dr is not to worry about it if you\'re not a mathematician.  Basically angular displacement is a rotation. And rotations don\'t commute. Which means they can\'t be vectors because mathematicians have said that one of the rules for vectors is that they have to commute under addition. So you can\'t use vectors, you have to use matrices.  Could we define vectors in a different way? Sure. But mathematicians have gone with that.  There are a few things like this where things that we treat as vectors or think of as vectors (outside mathematics) don\'t fit the strict definitions of vectors, but provided we don\'t tell the mathematicians it is all fine. Angular velocity and magnetic fields, for example, don\'t strictly meet the mathematical definition of a vector, but they are close enough that no one else cares - in these examples the things don\'t transform the \'right\' way under reflections or similar transformations. Rotations are even worse at pretending to be a vector than these things, so the difference is a bigger deal.  The infinitesimal angular displacement is ""allowed"" to be a vector(ish) because it does commute up to second order terms. So if it is small enough the difference isn\'t noticeable.', 'The top answer [here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/146897/if-angular-velocity-angular-acceleration-are-vectors-why-not-angular-displace) is pretty solid.

It\'s all the behind-the-scenes stuff that makes everything work. You look at the screen and see a picture of a dragon - that\'s the game. Somebody had to draw a dragon and put that in the game. What about the code that turns the drawing into 3D pixels? That\'s the engine.   So the engine is actually the majority of the code in the ""game"". It\'s not surprising it affects almost everything.   Yes, every engine has its upper limits. Something like the original Doom, for example, was designed to run on a DOS computer in 1994 or whatever, and it takes a lot of shortcuts for speed, and has a lot of limitations to make those shortcuts work. You can\'t look up or down in the original Doom. And the monsters aren\'t even 3D. Those are the limitations people accepted in exchange for getting it to work at all.  Sometimes there are fundamental design tradeoffs. For example, Factorio has a multiplayer mode. There\'s a lot of stuff happening in a Factorio game and it would be laggy if the server had to keep telling every player what was happening around them. So what it actually does is each player\'s computer runs the entire game and they stay synced up. But this means you can\'t have anything in the game that\'s random, because they\'d get out of sync. Even things that seem random aren\'t actually random. It also means every player\'s computer needs to download a copy of the entire game world, when they log in. And it means if anyone\'s computer is too slow to run the game at normal speed, everyone gets slowed down, or that person gets kicked out.  So you can either have multiplayer that isn\'t laggy, **or** people with slow computers can play multiplayer, but not both. And changing from one to the other means rewriting the whole multiplayer part of the game from scratch. If you show someone a game that\'s designed to avoid the lag and ask how slow computers can play multiplayer without slowing everything down, the answer is they can\'t. It\'s not that it\'s impossible; it\'s just impossible *in that engine design with the fast multiplayer*. If you changed it it wouldn\'t be the same multiplayer engine any more.

In particular, I believe the second answer too, which proceeds to explain that the infinitesimal angular displacement has a direction, which is the axis which it is turned. Does that mean that its direction is supposed to be the axis perpendicular to the plane where our point rotates?

A sphere is the most efficient 3 dimensional geometric shape for having the greatest volume with the least surface area.
