Disks are a LOT slower than RAM, so that\'s why an overloaded computer gets visibly slower: it can be in a state where EVERYTHING involves moving something to or from the swap file.

Let’s start with *differential equation*.  “Differential” is calculus-speak for “change”, or “rate of change”.  A *differential equation* is an equation, or a math statement, that tells you how fast something is changing, in terms of other things. A classic example is unrestrained bacterial cell division. Given sufficient space and resources, every bacteria cell can divide into 2 new cells each “cycle” (t). So if we have 2 cells, we gain +2 cells each cycle. If we have 10 cells, we gain +10 cells. In general, if we have *Y* cells, then we gain *Y* cells every cycle. In calculus speak:  > dY / dt = Y  where dY / dt means “how fast Y is changing each cycle (t). This is also called a *derivative* or a *differential*, making this a *differential equation*.  What about a *Partial* differential equation?  The “partial” means that there is more than 1 other variable that is going to affect things. In the above example, we only cared about how many bacteria would grow *per cycle*, or per unit of time. In calculus speak: we took the derivative of Y *with respect to* time (or “cycle”). What if the bacteria were growing along a wall, and bacteria at one end of the wall had more food and could grow faster than those at the other end of the wall? Now Y, the number of bacteria, depends not only on how much time has passed (t), but what position along the wall we are (x). So, we can take the *partial* derivative ∂Y/∂t, but we *also* need to take the partial derivative ∂Y/∂x to get the whole picture. ~~Note, these “d”s are usually lowercase Greek deltas when referring to partial derivatives.~~  Finally, *non-linear* refers to the exponents in the equation itself. “Linear” means variables are only raised to the first power and aren’t multiplied together. Our first example was linear, because the right side of the equation only has Y raised to the first power. If the number of bacteria along this wall changes by the *square* of the number of bacteria for each incremental step along the wall, we have  > ∂Y/∂x = Y^2  Which is a nonlinear partial differential equation.

This is also called a *derivative* or a differentials, making this a differentIAL equation.”    >What about a differential equation that is more than 1 other variable that is going to affect things.   For example, suppose we have a series of cells, each with a unique number of cells (say 10 cells).   Suppose we have an equation that tells us how fast each cell is dividing, and that equation is a differential.  Suppose that we took the derivative of Y with respect to time (or “cycle”). What if the bacteria were growing along a wall, and bacteria at one end of the wall had more food and could grow faster than those at the other end of wall?  Now Y, the number of bacteria, depends not only on how much time has passed (t), but what position along the wall we are (x). So we can take the derivative ∂Y/∂t to get the whole picture.  Now, if we take the differential equation and add in the number *of* cells, we get the differential differential equation ∂DY/Dt = *Y^2   Now that we have the differential, we can see that the difference between the two values is the *total* change in the cell number, and not the *partial* change.  So if we have 10 cells, and a wall of 1 meter, and 1 meter x, we gain 10 cells each cycle.  If we have 100 cells, then we gain 100 cells each time we go through the wall.  This is the difference in the differential between the *full* and *partial** change.', 'Is there any way to make this more intuitive?']"
