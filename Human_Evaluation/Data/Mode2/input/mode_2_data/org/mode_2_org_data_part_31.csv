Is this a fair way to put it?   I think the Fed is trying to slow the flow of cash because they are concerned that inflation will eventually lead to deflation.  If the Fed raises interest rates, it will raise the cost of borrowing and increase the cost for people to pay off their debts.  I don't see how this is a bad thing because it means that people will be able to pay down their debts faster.

This is a misconception.   The trash can is not empty, it is just filled with unused memory.  The computer is trying to find a new spot for all the unused memory, but it can\'t.  So it has to discard some of the unused RAM, and it will eventually run out of space.  This happens with most computers, but not all.

This is a common problem with Windows.  I've seen it happen with drivers too, but not usually on a large scale.    I think it's because of the way Windows is written.  For example, if I installed windows XP on my laptop and it crashed, I could restart it and everything would work fine.  But if I install windows 10 on my Mac, it crashes.  Why?   Because windows 10 is written in C++.  And it's not like windows XP where you can just run a quick install of a quick fix and everything should be fine."", ""I think that's a fair assumption.    I'm not saying that Windows is inherently better than Mac, but I do think that there's a certain level of tolerance for poor code.  For example, if you have a Windows XP computer, you can install a driver on it that will not crash your computer.  If you install a drivers for a Mac, you will need to restart your computer every few days.  And if you install the driver on a non-working computer, it will crash every few hours.  I think that is a fair enough assumption."", 'So if I restart my computer, it will crash?', '>However, it also seems to have some effects resembling those ADHD medications.

This is a misconception. The body is a very conductive tissue.    The way we measure body fat is by using electrical impulses.  The electrical impulses are generated by the cells in the body and are transmitted through the body.  They are the same way that electricity is transmitted from a telephone wire to a computer.  But the way the electrical impulses get to the computer is different.  It\'s called the ""circulation"" principle.  And the way it works is that the electrical impulse is created by the fat cells in your body and then transmitted to the computers.  Then the computer uses the information from the electrical signals to calculate the body fat.  In this way, the computer calculates the body weight using the information the computer has received.  How does the computer know the body is fat?  The answer is that it measures the electrical conductance of the body cells.  That\'s how we know the weight of a person.  By measuring the electrical current through the cells.', 'So the scale just reads the incoming and outgoing current and then calculates the fat mass?', 'I see.
