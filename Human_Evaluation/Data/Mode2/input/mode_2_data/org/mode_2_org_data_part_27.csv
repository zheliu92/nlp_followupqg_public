It is intentionally kept that way to minimize the effects of corrosion on the metal parts within the fuselage.    This is a misconception.  The air inside the plane has a high humidity.  It is actually quite the opposite.  When the cabin is completely dry, the air inside is extremely warm.  This happens because of the lack of air conditioning.  Also, the humidity inside the cabin can be very high.  If you have a humid room, you can get very dehydrated.  But if you have an air conditioner, you are fine.

You stop a red light with brakes, you're not going anywhere, your engine is still on and running so when you decide to move again it will do so.    This is a bit of a stretch, but I think it's a bit more accurate.  The operating system is constantly running, so if it stops, it doesn't have processes running.  But if it starts, it has processes running, and if it doesn’t, it stops.  So if it stopped, it wouldn’ t have processes.  And if it started, it would have processes that would run, and wouldn‘t have interrupts.  This would mean that if the computer stopped, there would be no process running, no interrupt.  That’s why I think the term idle is a little misleading.  It’d be more accurate to say that the computer is just sitting idle, waiting for something to happen.  If it starts up, it will run, but if it sits idle for a while, it won’T.  Because it’ll have processes working, and those processes are not running."", "">We could have had this conversation when soap companies started advertising during daytime TV in the 50's  This is a bad analogy.
