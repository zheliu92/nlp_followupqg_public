I'm not saying it's a bad thing, just that I always assumed it was a change in policy to prevent people from pocketing change."", 'So the extra 9/10 cents is just a cost of doing business?', ""Is it true that if you pay cash at the pump, you can't take the money out of the bag and spend it later?"", 'But why not just add a small amount on top of it?', ""Wouldn't this increase the chance of someone stealing a few dollars from you?"", 'What about cashiers?

If it's cold then pouring hot water on it will expand one side before the other and that stress inside the glass which might make it crack.  This isn't the case.  The problem is that when the water is hot it expands on the outside of the glass, not inside.  So if you pour hot water inside the window it will just expand again, and that's why it's not a problem.  Also, if you have a really cold car, you might want to check the inside of your car before you try this.  If you have windows that are really deep, you may want to take extra precautions.  I've had a few cars that were completely ice-free and I've tried to open the windows and it's still a problem (not to mention the fact that the water can get in through the cracks and get stuck).    I'm not saying that it's impossible to open a window with hot water, but that it might not be the best idea."", 'Does it really need to be so hot to do that?', 'Thanks for your answer!

Is that a bad idea?', 'Is it possible to keep them just on the verge of starvation?', ""Thanks for the answer!    I was under the impression that when we are stressed, we are more productive.   But I'm not sure that's the case.  I've been in a lot of stress situations and I've always felt like I'm working harder.  Maybe it's the way I think?   If I'm stressed, I think about things differently.  If i'm happy, I feel like I can do more.  But if I'm tired, I don't feel like doing as much.  It's like I have this internal clock that tells me I'm doing something right.  When I'm happy and feel like it, I'm just doing it.  So maybe it's like a cycle of stress - if I can keep myself happy, then I can get more done.  And if I feel stressed, then maybe I can focus more."", ""I've never heard of starvation being used for experiments.

Myelin is kind of like fiber optics for your internet connection versus dial up.  It's not that it's not there, it's just that the signal is going through different wires. Some is faster than others, and some are slower.  The faster wires are for the electrical impulses, while the slower wires are just for the chemical signals.  So if you have a phone line that goes from your phone to your computer, the signal will go up the fastest wires, and down the slower ones.  But if you take a phone signal from your computer to your phone, the same signal will travel down both of those wires.  Why is that?  Because the faster wires carry the electrical signal to your receiver, while slower wires carry it to your device.  Because that's how our brains work.  And the faster signals are the ones that get to your devices faster, while slow signals are just the ones getting to your brain."", 'Is it possible to send a message instantly if you have a lot of people holding up signs with the letters?', 'Thanks for the answer!
