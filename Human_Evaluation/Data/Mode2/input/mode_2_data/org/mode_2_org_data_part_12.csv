So if I understand correctly, the radiation is coming from the protons in the core and coming out of the spheres as a result of the fission?', ""But wouldn't that just make the core hotter?"", 'I see, but why would it be so concentrated?', 'What about the plutonium? Is that just a byproduct of the fusion reaction or is it a by-product of some other process?', 'So if I understand correctly, the vapor cone is a sign of a plane entering the transonic regime (e.g. hitting Ma 1.0)?', 'So is it possible to see through the sound barrier?', '>What you\'re seeing is called a vapor cone, and it is not inherently related to supersonic flight.    >It\'s generally a sign of a plane entering the transonic regime (e.g. Ma 0.7 to 0.9), but while it\'s an indication that a plane is certainly traveling fast, it\'s not necessarily evidence that they\'ve actually hit Ma 1.0 or higher.  >The vapor cone is a phenomenon that occurs when a large object is travelling at a very high speed relative to the Earth\'s rotation (typically about Mach 0.5).   The vapor cone formed by the large object traveling at a high speed is a byproduct of the shock wave created by the object traveling so fast relative to Earth\'s rotational velocity (the ""vapor cone"") and the expansion of the air (the condensation of the vapor).  >When the object is traveling at high speed, it is experiencing a tremendous amount of turbulence.  The turbulence is caused by the massive air pressure being generated by the enormous object traveling very fast relative (relative to the earth\'s rotation) and the large air speed differences between the object and the Earth (relative (to the speed of light) making the turbulence very intense.  This turbulence is what causes the vapor cone to form.  It\'s a phenomenon called the ""transonic regime"".   It is a type of turbulence that occurs in the air when a massive object is moving at a speed of about Mach 1.5.  When a large plane hits this speed, the shock waves and expansion fans caused by this large object are extremely intense, and the vapor cones formed by these waves are extremely small.  So when you see a vapor cloud forming, it isn\'t necessarily a sign that the plane is traveling very quickly.  Instead, it may be a sign (in the case of a very large object) that the shockwave has reached its maximum and the air is no longer able to withstand the shock.  If you see the vapor cloud, it means that the object has reached a point where it is no more able to hold the air in its cabin, and therefore is no further from the Earth.  In this case, the object breaking through the sound barrier is a large meteorite (or a meteorite, or a meteor, or whatever it is).', ""So it's not a sign of a transonic regime, it's just a sign that they're traveling fast enough that they've hit the boundary?"", 'I see, but what about a plane traveling at 0.5 mph?

From a bank to another, there are checks to be made, like everything related to money laundering, funnelling funds to avoid taxes, that sort of stuff.  The receiving bank can chose not to run the checks, but its responsibility is engaged if they do so, so they do not.    The second reason is that it's easier to conceal the money from authorities.  If you have a bank account in another country, you can just transfer the money there and have it counted as US dollars.  But if you have one in another jurisdiction, you need to have a US bank account there, and the US government has rules and regulations that apply.  So why can't you just transfer it there and not have it taxed as US currency?"", 'Is it possible to transfer money from one bank to another without having to run a security check?', 'I\'m not sure what you mean by that, but I\'m guessing it\'s something like ""it\'s not worth the time spent"" or ""it doesn\'t really matter"".

Well, because people are working at the businesses, allowing them to be open - so you are asking 'why is the business open, and closed when it is closed?'   I guess I'm asking 'Why do we have business hours, and weekends?' And the answer to that is that people want to do group activities in their non-work times - sports, religious services etc - that require everyone to be available, and if people all worked different hours, then at any random time, half of society would always be working and so be unavailable. That is why labour movements forced in laws enshrining weekends and relatively fixed working hours.    Also, why do most places like the DMV, The Bank, etc are only open during the week?  I know that most people work during the day, but I'm not sure why they're not open on the weekend.  I'm guessing it's because most people don't have flexible schedules, and they're just not used to being on call during the weekend?
