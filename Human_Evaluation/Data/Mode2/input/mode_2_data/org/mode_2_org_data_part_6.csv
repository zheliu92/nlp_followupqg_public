I was wondering if this is something that happens to animals too?', 'So if I eat a lot of bananas, I could actually lose weight?', 'Is this why some people get diabetes?', 'Why do we react faster when they are louder?', ""I think evolution has got us into this position and we are basically stuck with it.   I'm not sure why we react faster to louder sounds, but I think it's because our brains are wired to respond faster to them."", 'How did we evolve to be this way?', ""What about when it's a dog barking?"", 'Why is it that louder sounds trigger the startle reflex more than quieter sounds?', ""I think this is the key. If you have really high anxiety, a phobia, or other related problems, your threshold for your startle reflex will be lower than other people's   I've noticed that if I hear a loud noise, I react faster than other kids. I'm not sure if this is because I'm more aware of the sound, or if it's because I have a higher threshold for the startle response?"", ""So if I hear a loud noise and I jump, I'm more likely to react faster than someone else?"", 'What about people who are phobic?', 'How does that work?', '>Oversimplification alert: atoms have an outer layer of electrons. When there aren’t 8 electrons in this outer layer the electrons get lonely. To make the electrons in the outer layer happy the atom will find other atoms with unhappy electrons and share or exchange electrons so both atoms’ electrons will be happy.    Is there a way to make the unhappy electrons happy?', 'So if there are 8 electrons in the outer layer, then why are there different bonds between atoms in the inner layer?', ""But why can't carbon bond with other atoms?"", 'What about hydrogen? Does it have an inner layer of electrons too?', 'Is there a way to make the bonds stronger or weaker?', ""I see, but why can't they just share?"", 'How realistic are the photos of the Earth?', 'Are there any weather satellites that can take photos of the Earth from above?', 'So are they all just made up or are they real?', 'What about the videos we see on social media? Do they have any source?', ""I see, but how do we know that it's not a hoax?"", 'But how realistic is it?', 'How does the body know when to stop or start making RBCs?', 'So if I have too much water in my blood, it will stop making RBCs?', 'But how does the body know when to stop?', 'Thanks for the answer! So if I understand correctly, violet is a continuous wheel. After violet it goes back to red, so blue coming before violet and red coming after means that combining them will make violet or purple?', 'So if we can combine red and yellow, then we can make violet?']"
