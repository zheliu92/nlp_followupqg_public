This is the one that stuck with me the longest.    The ST was one of those rare devices that had a logic board at a 90 degree angle to the mainboard that had soldered connections between the two PCBs. Cooling and heating cycles would cause tiny hairline fractures to form in the ""cold solder joints"" until eventually the system would fail until you reflowed those cold solder joints.  This was a common problem with the ST, but it was a lot easier to patch the solder joints than to drill holes in the PCB and drill holes through the metal plate.', ""Thank you for the reply! I remember one of those cases where the computer would suddenly stop working and you'd have to restart it.    I was in the manufacturing department of Intel at the time, and we had a lot of these issues. We had a status updates to a distro list as we progressed with the troubleshooting and resolution. One of those times, I was on the list, and the status update was still not showing up. I went into panic mode, kicked the server off its perch, and just started shaking my balls off.  After a while, I calmed down and realized that I was just shaking my ass off trying to figure out why the damn thing wouldn't work.  I went back to work, and eventually got it working.  It was a weird experience, but it made me feel better to know that I could fix it."", ""Thanks for replying!
