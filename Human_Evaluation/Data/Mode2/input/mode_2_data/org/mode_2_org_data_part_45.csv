The easiest way to think about heat is if we're talking about a gas made up of a bunch of atoms. Temperature in this system is a measure of how much those atoms jiggle. If they're jiggling a lot, then they're very hot. If they're not jiggling much, then it's cold. If you touch a hot gas, the atoms in the gas hit your hand very quickly and cause the atoms in your hand to jiggle from all the impacts. If you light a match, the energy from the match causes the atoms to jiggle even more meaning it's heating up more. If you throw a ball in the gas, every atom it hits gains energy, and then hits a bunch of other atoms causing the entire gas to gain jiggling while slowing down the ball (air friction).  Now how do you remove the jiggling from the gas? There is a concept in physics called entropy. Smashing an egg on the ground is very easy to do. Putting the egg back together again takes a lot of time and effort. Similarly, getting a billion gas molecules to jiggle is easy. Getting them all to stop jiggling is very hard and takes effort.

There is a concept in physics called entropy. If you throw a ball in the gas, every atom it hits gains entropy (because of the friction) and then hits a bunch of other atoms causing the entire gas to gain jiggled while slowing down the ball (air friction).    This is called the law of conservation of entropy.   If you take a ball and put it in a vacuum, the air will pull the ball out, leaving the gas intact.  But if you put the ball in a liquid, the gas will still retain its state, even if the air is pulling away.  This means that the gas is still a solid, even though the ball is no longer holding it.  The question is, how do we remove the gas from the state?   The answer is, with enough effort, you can make it cold.', 'So if I understand correctly, when you put an egg on the ground it will break apart?', ""I'm not sure I understand this at all, but I'm trying to understand it.

How do you remove the gas?"", ""Thanks for the explanation!   I'm still a little confused about the jiggling part though. If you put an egg on the ground and rub it with your hand, it should instantly stop jiggled. But if you rub it again, it won't stop.

The US dollar is worth about $5.50 in the US today, whereas the South Korean won is worth around $2.50.  I think the reason the US Dollar is worth so much more is because of its relative stability relative to other countries’ currencies.
