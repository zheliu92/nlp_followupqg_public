You can transform vectors by multiplying matrices by them, for example a rotation of 180 degrees in 2D can be represented by the matrix  |\\-1|0| |:-|:-| |0|\\-1|  If you multiply any vector by this matrix then it will rotate it around 180 degrees.  Now most matrices aren't that simple and they will do a combination of operations, changing the length and direction of vectors in complex ways.For a given matrix an eigenvector is one which doesn't have its direction changed, i.e only its length is scaled when you multiply it by that matrix. The eigenvalue is how much that length is scaled.  For example if we have some matrix M and a vector (3,5). Then say we multiply M\\*V and get a new vector (6,10) which = 2\\*(3,5). This means V is an eigenvector of M with an eigenvalue of 2, applying M to V has just scaled it by a factor 2 without changing its direction."", ""In the language of vectors and matrices; A geometric vector is basically something with a length and direction.

Is this true for all vaccines?', 'I see, but why is it that the vaccine needs to be produced and distributed before it can be effective?', 'But why is it that after the first dose it reacts differently to the second dose?', 'Is it safe to assume that after 3 weeks the immune system will have gone back to normal operation?', '> After the first injection you get a strong response from the immune system that will be able to get rid of the vaccine. But you only get a partial response from your body, because the vaccine is inactivated before it enters your cells.   This is because the immune cells are no longer working properly. The vaccine is still inactivated, but the immune response has died down.  This happens when the vaccine enters the cells, and it\'s not until after the second injection that the immune systems can fully react to the vaccine, so it\'s a case of ""if you have the vaccine and the vaccine works, it will work"".    The reason why there is exactly 3 weeks between the stabs for the BioNTech vaccine is because that was what they used in their stage 3 trial so that is what have been certified.  The trial was done in the US, and the US is the only country that has a protocol in place for this type of clinical testing.  According to the FDA, the protocol is ""effective at 95% of the doses given.""   Based on this, the FDA has issued a ""no marketing"" order for the vaccine to be distributed in the U.S.  However, the agency is still waiting for the paperwork to be completed.  So, for now, the vaccine will be available in the stores, and you can get it at any time.  I\'m not sure if this is a good idea or not, but I\'m curious to hear what you think of it.', 'I see. So why did the trial use three stabs instead of just one?', 'So why is it that the vaccine requires multiple stabs?', 'So basically, the vaccine is just a way to get the immune system to recognize the vaccine?', ""I think I phrased my question poorly. I meant, if two observers are watching the same event, wouldn't they see it as happening simultaneously?"", '>There is no such thing as ""at the same time"" for things far away or moving very fast.   What you mean is that it\'s impossible for two objects to be *at* the same place at the same exact time.  For example, if you have two objects in the same room, one is moving away from the other, and the two objects are moving towards each other.  But if you take two objects that are moving away at the exact same speed, one object will pass by the other one, and both objects will pass through the other. So if you look at two objects at the very same time, one will pass in front of the other and both will pass behind.  So if two objects move at the speed of light, one of them will pass between the other before the other object can see them.  This is called the ""paradigm paradox"".', 'So if you see B happening before A, then B is happening before C?', ""That's a very good answer.
