Proteins and hormones can be used to stimulate certain behaviors in cells.

From there it divides over and over again, each time using nutrients to make more cells.

I think that's a fair statement.  How many people do you think are watching cable tv that revolves around sugary foods?"", "">Because all of the food now is riddled with terrible ingredients we have not evolved to eat naturally so some corporations can take in large profits.   I think that's a fair statement.  I'm not saying that corn is bad for you, I'm saying that it's bad for the environment.  We have been using corn for a long time now, and it's been around for thousands of years. The US was the first country to industrialize corn, and they did it for a very long time before that.  The US is still a corn based economy, and the US is a corn dependent economy, so why haven't we done more to reduce the amount of corn we have produced and make it less expensive to produce?  I don't think that the US has done enough to combat the over-consumption of corn, but I do think that we have made a lot of progress in reducing the amount we eat.  If we could do that, we would have less sugar and more protein.  Also, I think the US government should do more to combat addiction.  Like, if we could make it illegal to buy a pack of chips with a single sugar packet, we could stop people from eating them.  Or if we had a federal law that made it illegal for people to sell cigarettes, they could be taxed for smoking.  There are tons of other things that could be done to stop people addicted to cigarettes, like mandating that they use a specific flavors of cigarettes, and that are bad for your body.  And I think we need to do more research into the effects of these things.  For example, I've read a lot about the effects on the brain and the immune system. I think it's clear that smoking is bad, and addictive.  It's very hard to lose weight whenever you eat these foods because they cause inflammation, slow down metabolism, they wreak havoc on your insulin response, create what is known as the sugar trap (which is the idea that sugary foods make you hungrier and hungrier, as you eat more and more you never feel full, and a host of other biological issues that would not be present if we didn't have protections stopping the exploitations of these neurochemical responses to terrible foods that are addictive.<QUS>  I agree with you.

I think it's a marketing thing, I don't know if it has anything to do with nutrition. I feel like I'm being brainwashed by the media and I'm watching a lot of ads for sugar.
