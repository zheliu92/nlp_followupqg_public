I’m not talking about the actual sound effects, but the way they are added to the movie.   For example, in the scene where the girl is getting her heart broken, she’ll be wailing and the sound is added to make it seem like she‘s actually wailing.  This is done to add tension to the scene, and to make the audience feel the pain.  The sound is also added to enhance the actors’ voices.  I think this is the most common thing that happens when they do this.  It’d be like if they added a voice to a song, and then later on, they would have a different vocal style.  But when they did this, they did it for a different kind of song, so it’re not really a song at all.

If we were just a group of hunter-gatherer animals that lived for survival, we would have no interest in play.  But we evolved to be more interested in other things besides survival.
