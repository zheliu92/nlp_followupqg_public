A very long time ago, people in marketing figured out that consumers perceive a price of, say, $1.99 to be significantly less than a price of $2.00. Of course, those prices are not actually very different, but people tend to round down to the nearest significant digit rather than rounding up when they are purchasing consumer goods. The same is true for something like refrigerators: buyers will look at a fridge that costs $1199 and one that costs $1200, and they will express a preference for the slightly cheaper one regardless of any benefits the slightly more expensive one may possess. Psychologically, that $1 difference between 1199 and 1200 is very impactful. Now, let's change the prices of those refrigerators to, say, $1286 and $1288. Now people will look at the two refrigerators and perceive them both as being essentially the same price (which they are) because the significant digit  - 2 - is the same. For that very same reason, both refrigerators could increase in price to $1289, or even $1299, and nobody would even care. If the price creeps to $1300, the significant digit has changed and people start to think they're being hornswoggled.   The 9/10 thing is related to that behavior. Consumers ignore the 9/10 and focus on the pennies because that's the significant digit in a gasoline price.

Of course, those prices are not actually very different, but people tend to round down to the nearest significant digit rather than rounding up when they are purchasing consumer goods. The same is true for something like refrigerators: buyers will look at a fridge that costs $1199 and one that costs $1200, and they will express a preference for the slightly cheaper one regardless of any benefits the slightly more expensive one may possess. Psychologically, that $1 difference between 1199 and 1200 is very impactful. Now, let's change the prices of those refrigerators to, say, $1286 and $1288. Now people will look at the two refrigerators and perceive them both as being essentially the same price (which they are) because the significant digit  - 2 - is the same. For that very same reason, both refrigerators could increase in price to $1289, or even $1299, and nobody would even care. If the price creeps to $1300, the significant digit has changed and people start to think they're being hornswoggled.   The 9/10 thing is related to that behavior. Consumers ignore the 9/10 and focus on the pennies because that's the significant digit in a gasoline price. This effectively allows oil companies to charge an extra .9 cents per gallon of gas without you even realizing it.""]","['What a unique job. What career path led you into that?', 'What a unique job.

I get where you’re coming from — the intrinsic factor is to do with atomic bonding in the minerals which make up the rock, and (if sedimentary) the particular medium which cemented it during lithification.   Certain other factors of the environment that the rock finds itself in are also important though. Most obvious would be the pressure and temperature conditions: higher temperatures encourage many deformation and/or transport mechanisms on the atomic scale as they are essentially all temperature dependent (things like Coble creep, grain boundary diffusion, Nabarro–Herring creep, grain rotation etc) which are the ways that solid crystalline materials (like rock) can deform in a ductile manner without fracturing. Higher pressures help confine the rock in all directions, so it’s less likely to rupture/fracture. So as you go deeper in the crust, you get increases in both temperature and pressure until you get about 15 km down and you’re in the brittle-ductil transition zone. Much further and it will only be ductile deformation occurring, no fracturing at all.   The other important factor is water. You are right that water is not going to change the physical properties of the minerals themselves unless it’s a water soluble mineral (and thus gets eroded) or one which can take up water into its crystalline structure. Now, although water does not enter the crystalline structure of other minerals (which is the vast majority of minerals), it generally generally reduces the brittle strength as a result of adsorption: water as a pore fluid decreases the surface energy, promotes crack growth and stress corrosion *without the rock having to reach the critical stress points.*  Having said all that, the exact result of more water being present as a pore fluid will depend on all the factors combined — what is the type of stress and the rate of stress being applied? What are the temperature and pressure conditions? What type of rock is it and what is its overall porosity and permeability? Is the pore space evenly distributed or very heterogeneous? So it’s definitely not a straightforward question, but I think more often than not, the addition of water increases the amount of brittle deformation going on.', '> In regards to brittleness, water has very little to do with it   I dunno, I think water often plays a significant role in how brittle rocks are or not.
