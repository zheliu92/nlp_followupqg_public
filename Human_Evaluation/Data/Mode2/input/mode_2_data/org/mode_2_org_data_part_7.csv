Now draw a 45° angled line: looks like a staircase) This jagged effect is called aliasing.  In games, it\'s usually done in the context of a scene where the edges of the image are jagged, and the game uses the aliasing to smooth out the edges so that the image appears less jagged and more natural.   In the case of a game where the scene is rendered in a higher resolution, it might look jagged because the edges are not perfectly aligned, but because the game is using a higher amount of pixels, it can appear more natural and realistic.  This is because the pixels are being processed in a way that preserves the original colors, but makes them appear more ""realistic"" in a manner that makes them look more ""lit"" and ""real"".    This isn\'t necessarily true for every game though. For example, if I\'m playing GTA San Andreas in a PS4, the game will probably still look fine in 1080p, but if I put it in a Vive, it will probably look worse because the resolution is lower.  Because the pixels in the game are being ""sampled"" in some way, the edges will appear jagged.  With a higher pixel density, it could mean that the edges on the game itself are not smooth, and that the game may appear less realistic in some ways.  But if I have a higher-resolution PS4 Pro, it may look worse in some places because the image is being processed differently than it would be in a lower-resolution PC.  So if I want to play GTA San Antonio in a 1080p PC, I need to upscale the resolution of my graphics card so that it looks more realistic.', 'So if I have a 1080p TV and a VR headset, how do I get the same amount of pixels to appear the same?', 'Thank you for the answer!

If the dentist isn't trained, he can have a CRNA that is to administer it.    This is a misconception.  Doctors are not required to be trained in any medical procedure.  They are required to have a license to practice dentistry, and they are required by law to practice in their respective state.  Also, doctors are not the only people that are able to write prescriptions, and dentists and optometrists are included in that, though what they are allowed to prescribe is determined at a state or local level.  The reason I ask is because I've had a few patients who were referred to me by their eye doctor, and I was told that they can't do the procedure without a license.
