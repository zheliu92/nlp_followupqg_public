So if we know that the universe is expanding, then how do we know it's expanding faster than light?"", "">Have you ever heard a train horn or siren get higher-pitched as it approached then lower-pitching as it went by? Well, that's the Doppler effect.   It's a bit of a paradox, but it's actually quite simple. When you hear a train whistle, it's usually the same sound as when you're watching it on TV, but the sound is compressed as it travels towards you, so it's making it sound higher-sounding as it goes along. When the train goes away, it'll be the same as if it were traveling at normal speed, but because it's moving away, its sound will be different.  This is called redshift.  It happens when we look out into space and see a galaxy, and it's called the Doppelfrequenz.  The reason it happens is because the light is moving away from us, and the light molecules are moving away with it. So the light in the universe is stretching, and that's why it's redshifting.  If you hear the sound of a train, it will be the exact same as when it's coming towards you. But if you hear it going away, you'll notice that it's not quite as loud.  That's because the sound waves are moving apart, and so the sound isn't traveling at the same speed as it was before.  So the sound you're hearing is actually coming from a different part of the universe, and as it moves away, the sound gets different."", 'Do you know what happens when light is stretched?', ""I've heard of redshift, but I've never seen anything like it.

This would mean that the US would have to borrow money at a higher interest rate (countries generally borrow money by issuing bonds and asking people, countries, organisations to buy them with the promise of routine payments and then at a set date paying the bond off).    I'm not sure how this would affect the US's credit rating, but I'm guessing it would hurt the economy.  I know that the government has a lot of debt, but it's not like the US is sitting on a pile of gold and can just take it out of the bank and spend it.  If the US were to default on its debt, it would have a lot more trouble getting loans from other countries.  So I'm wondering if this would have an impact on the US economy?"", 'So if the US defaults on its debt, what happens to its credit rating?', 'Is it possible for a country to pay off its debt without having to pay interest on it?', '>Dry shampoo is a spray on powder that will absorb the extra oil in your hair.

How does the circuit know how much energy the devices plugged into it need?   Is it a physical thing?  I know that the voltage is measured by the flow through the circuit but how does it know how many times it has to be applied before it stops?  Is there a way to tell how much voltage is needed before it starts flowing?  Or is it just a mathematical equation?', 'So the voltage is the same as the current?', 'But how does it know what voltage is being applied and how much current is being drawn?', 'So how does the circuit know how much current it needs?', '> If you run a direct wire between the live and ground prongs of your outlet, there is little to impede their flow and you get a flood of electrons - breakers in your house shut off power when this happens.   This is a misconception.  Current is a direct voltage.  The problem is that when you put a direct current (say 5V) through a resistor, the resistance decreases. This hinders the flow.  So how does the circuit know how much current it needs?    The answer is that it measures the resistance of the wire and then calculates the current flow through the device.  This can be done by measuring the resistance and the current current through the resistor, or by measuring how fast the current is flowing through the circuit.  If the resistor is too low, then the device will not be able to handle the current.  But if the resistor has a resistance of 100V, then how does it know how fast it is flowing?  The answers to these questions are in the equations that describe the electrical field and how it works.  They are not necessarily the same as the equations describing the electrical conductance.', 'What about capacitors? Do they have a resistance too, or are they just not as effective?', 'How does it know what voltage is being fed into it?']"
