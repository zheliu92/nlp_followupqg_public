Inductors are the opposite. Low impedance at low frequencies, and high impedance at high frequencies. And impedance basically means frequency dependent resistance. So, one thing you can do is use a capacitor to drive high frequencies into the ground, and inductor to do the same for low frequencies. Boom, that's a band-pass filter. That's pretty useful for radio applications, since you probably don't want to be listening all the frequencies at the same time.  Now for radios, a tuning capacitor is certainly used to control the internal mixing frequency, but that works just the same for incoming and outgoing signals. I'm not se sure if a variable inductor for transmitting was ever a thing."", ""Capacitors have high impedance at low frequencies, and low impedance at high frequencies. Inductors are the opposite.

However, when cooled, it can become a gas that can get into the bloodstream and cause further problems.  This happens when we use acetone to make glue, or when we rub our mouths with it.
