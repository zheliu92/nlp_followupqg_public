So to show the statement is true you need to discover a lot of maths and in 1995 ane 129 pages long proof was published by Andrew Wiles. So it took 358 years until a mathematical proof fo that statement was possible"", ""Pure math problems can be simple to state but very hard to show that they are true. The problem tends to be general in nature so you can't just test all alternatives  A famous example is Fermat's Last Theorem stated in 1637  It states that a\\^n +b\\^n = c\\^n do not have an integer solution for n >2  Finding a solution of n=1 is trivial because a number to the power of 1 is itself so 1^1+1^1=2^1 => 1+1=2  It is alos easy to find a solution for n=2    3^2+4^2=5^2 => 9+16=15  The problem is now how do you show that there is not a solution for n>2?  If you just test different options you can only show that there is not a solution for the one you have tested. You can test a lot of numbers on a computer but the number you have tested will always be limited.  If you like to test it for a b and n less than 1 billion you start to reach calculation time for a computer longer than the age of the universe. Even if you could do that calculation how do you know there is not a solution when some number are in the trillions?   There is an infinite number of integers so it is impossible to test all alternatives.

I'm guessing that you know this based on sight.  I'm not sure how you know that, but I'm glad you asked.  The answer is that the brain uses predictions to make predictions. When given the sight of a metal bar as sensory input, the brain made a prediction: this is a hard metal object that will cause pain if it hits the body. Visual parts of the brain then sent a signal to predictive parts of your brain, which sent a message to parts of parts of brain that feel pain. The feeling of pain was a prediction, and what you noticed was a pattern of pain that was not a prediction error.    This is a very interesting example of how the brain can use predictions to come up with a pattern for how to interpret the world, even when it's not a part of the body, and it's a bit baffling.  How exactly predictions are made about pain remains an area of active research, and there are many different ways to look at it.  Edit: also, another example of predicted pain is the [rubber hand illusion](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sxwn1w7MJvk). If you use sensory input to trick the brain into perceiving a rubber hand as part of your body, suddenly hitting the rubber hand with a hammer will cause a feeling of shock as a prediction.  This was discovered by a Japanese researcher, who used a video game to test the hypothesis that a rubber hands are part of our body and that when the hand is struck, the hand will respond to the shock by moving away from the force of the impact.  >The brain is a prediction machine   I don't know why this question got downvoted, since it's such a really great question that gets into some deep neuroscience.  It's a good explanation of how our brain uses prediction to make decisions.  In this case, the prediction is based on the fact that the rubber hands were a part our body, not our mind.  What we see is the brain’s ‘best guess’ of what’ll happen next.  We can use this to make a lot of predictions about the world around us, and even make predictions about what we want to do.  But we can also use it to make bad decisions."", 'Thank you for the reply! I\'m not sure what you mean by prediction.    For example, when I was a kid, my parents gave me a hammer.

When the glands create a tear, it is a liquid that is absorbed by your eyelids and then released through the cuticle (the lining of the eye) into your bloodstream.  This gas is called a gas.  A gas is also called a lubricant.  Liquid lubricant is a chemical that is produced by your eyes and is a lubricity that lubricates your eyes.  In humans, it can be found in the blood vessels around the eyes, and in certain animals (like dogs, cats, and horses).', 'What about the eyelashes?', 'So the water just flows through the eyelashes and out of them?', 'How does it work?', 'But why does it go through the eye?', 'I thought that was the question?', "">Now, we want to encode a message into our wave. The way we do this is by varying one or more of the amplitude or phase of the wave.  How do we do that?  Amplitude modulation is used in a lot of different kinds of modulation systems.  For example, most modern communications is built off of variations of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation, where you use fixed variations of frequency/amplitude/phase to encode digital values (4 in the case of 'Quadrature', although more complex systems exist).    How does this work?  Is it possible to change the fundamental wave of a signal without altering the fundamental signal itself?"", 'So how do we know what the fundamental wave is?', 'What about light? How does it differ from the other types of light?', 'I see. So how do we convert these signals into digital forms?']"
