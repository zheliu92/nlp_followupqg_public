Also am a ACE certified national personal trainer.   First off, I think it’s important to note that there are different types of deadlifting, but between conventional and sumo, deadlifts use %85 of muscles in your body when done correctly.   As already noted above, hips and knees drive the movement, and the load is shared throughout %85 the body (at different times throughout the movement). ~%45 of this should be your core, as it should be engaged the entire lift (many people don’t realize this)!  The part of deadlifts being a compound leg exercise is predominantly the moment between picking up the bar from the ground, and performing the hip hinge. This exercises the hamstrings and quads immensely.   Isometric contractions moreso consist of squeezing your muscle area to “activate”/warm up your muscle in an area. Ex. Weak glutes when squatting —> isometrics for glutes before squatting.    Happy lifting!', 'Hello!

This came falling back down all around the planet, and as it entered the atmosphere it started to heat up from re-entry, heating the air around it as well.  All over the planet, for hours, the sky above was red hot, glowing like an oven....and cooking anything on the surface of the earth...this would have caused massive wildfires as well.  Then, after this deadly pulse of heat, massive amounts of dust in the upper atmosphere would have blotted out the sun, cooling the earth and making it hard for plants to grow.  Only years later did the planet regain some sort of equilibrium, but by this time a mass extinction had wiped out many species and ecosystems were really out of whack.  So what does this have to do with crocodiles?  Well, if we look at patterns of extinction on land, what we see is that basically all the species that survived on land were smaller than about a kilogram...small enough to hide under something and avoid being baked to death during the first stage.    Crocs are much bigger than that, of course...but they live in streams.  _Stream_ life actually had an easier time than purely terrestrial animals.  Not just crocodiles, but turtles and amphibians too.  Why?  For one thing, when the sky turns boiling hot it helps to be able to dive under water.  And while food chains on land mostly depend on green and growing plants to survive,  food chains in streams often depend on detritus falling into streams...leaves fall into streams, bugs break down the leaves, fish eat the bugs, crocs eat the fish.  This means that during the aftermath of the impact, when nearly everything on land was dead or dying, freshwater ecosystems were better able to sort of limp along until things recovered, living on fallen plant matter, etc.  A lot of species still died...but they didn't _all_ die like all the (non avian) dinosaurs did."", ""Here's the current understanding of it:  When the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs hit, it smacked into the earth and ejected a bunch of rock, knocking a lot even up into space around earth.

This came falling back down all around the planet   This was the second time it happened, but the first time was when it hit the moon, and the second was when the asteroid hit the sun.  The second time was because of the heat generated by the impact, and because of all the dust coming down, it was much more intense than the first.  And because of this, it took millions of years for the planet to cool down enough for plants and animals to recover.  Only years later did the planet regain some sort of equilibrium, but by this time a mass extinction had wiped out many species and ecosystems were really out of whack.

The reason is that to cut something you need pressure, which is proportional to both force and applied area. So the sharper the knife the smaller the cutting edge area is, and the less force is needed to cut.    The same principle applies to any sharp object, except knives.  If you have a very sharp object that you're cutting with a very thin blade, you're going to need more force to cut it than if you had a very long blade.  So the more you cut, the more force you'll need to exert to cut the object.  With a very short blade, the amount of force you need to apply is much less.  This is why knives are so much easier to handle than other sharp instruments.  Because you're not using any sort of pressure.  You're just using a very small amount of material that's already there, and it's already absorbing some of the force that's being applied.  And that's why knives can be so much more effective at cutting things than other knives."", 'So the more you cut, the more pressure you apply?', 'Thanks for your answer!
