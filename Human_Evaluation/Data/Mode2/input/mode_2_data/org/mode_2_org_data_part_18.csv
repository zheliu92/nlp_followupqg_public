There is a definition of a cult.   A cult is a religious organization based on control, who uses that control to remove negative influence about the cult towards the members to exert control over the belief system and remove rational thought about it.  Normal beliefs have a cycle to their creation:  1.  Idea - what is the thesis?  2.  Positive reinforcement - what are all the thoughts that support the idea?  3. Negative reinforcement - what are all the things that go against the thesis and make it not true?  4.  Reflection - weighing the positive against the negative in reflective thought  5.  Belief - what is your conclusion after considering the thesis from other angles and hearing from multiple perspectives on the issue.   Cults remove #3 and because of that you have no negative reinforcement. No negative and there is only positive going into reflection. So you get a fast track to belief.  A cult is anything where your beliefs must match the rest or you are berated, abused, or expelled from the group and the relationships with any members are based completely on your acceptance of said beliefs.', 'My father was a cult deprogrammer in the 1970’s and early 80’s.

Also the US norm of having insurance tied to your job creates problems.  A solution would be to decouple insurance from employment.  If your employer provides benefits, there’s a “total compensation” number somewhere on the books.  Like if your salary is 50k plus benefits, it’s likely costing the company 75k to employ you.  Instead of the company providing insurance, if the compensation became just pay you 75k, but no benefits, with a more open market option for health insurance, like there is for home or auto insurance, more options could emerge.  You’re someone young and healthy with no kids? Sure, here’s a plan that is dirt cheap, but doesn’t cover much beyond catastrophic accidents/illness.  You’re married and have 3 kids? Here’s a plan that costs a bit more and covers more.  You’re a hypochondriac that’s constantly convinced you’re dying?  Here’s a plan that covers everything imaginable, but you’re going to have to pay a lot for it.  Another option is tort reform for lawsuits.  High risk medical fields like OB, surgeons, etc have to carry enormous levels of malpractice insurance and liability.  If they’re in private practice, premiums can run into the 6 figures.  This decreases the amount of people willing to assume that level of risk, meaning shortages.  Any time there’s a shortage, price goes up.  So reducing the ability to sue a doctor for millions of dollars for something that isn’t blatantly their incompetence (like an injury to mom or baby when giving birth, even if all protocols and good practices were followed) could help too, because then there’d be lower risk to such fields and more people would want to go into them, meaning wait times and price could go down.', 'The medical industry, and specifically the medical insurance industry is very heavily regulated.

They treat the patient, send them an outrageous bill and because it’s outrageous and affects credit they don‘t have anyway, they let it lapse.  I’m not sure what you mean by that.   I was in the ER once for a minor procedure and they charged me $3200. I was like, what? I‘m not paying for that. I”m paying for the pain medication.  They gave him steroid shots which put him in more pain and tried doing X-rays on him. They tried sending us another $800 bill for  reasons They said as doctor *looked* at his paperwork…We didn’T pay it.  So, what’ll happen if I get a new x-ray?  I don”t know. I guess I“ll have to pay it back.”    My insurance company is going to let me default on the bill.  But I„m not going to pay the bill because I‚m not a patient.  And I‸m not gonna pay it because I don´t want to pay for other people’�s health care because we literally already are and we get nothing back for it.', ""Thank you for the reply!  I was wondering, what happens if the doctor doesn't actually treat the patient?"", 'How do you pay for this stuff? I’m not a doctor but my husband is. I can pay for the ER visit but not the steroid shots.', ""I think this question is highly dependent on the tree species. For instance, a Water Oak in perfect conditions will still likely begin rotting from the inside due to too much moisture build up in the trunk and it will collapse within 30-50 years. A Live Oak, however, will continue to grow until it can't support its own weight which takes 250-500 years. Even then, Live Oaks will sometimes just fall over and begin sprouting new trees from the fallen trunk.    I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing, but I'm curious to know if this happens to other trees as well."", 'Is there any way to know how long a Live Oak will live?', ""But what if there's no external influence?"", 'But what if it has everything it needs to survive for as long as possible?', 'What causes it to die?', 'How does one know when a tree is getting old?', 'Is there any way to reverse this?', "">Over a long enough time, trees go through senescence:  >the condition or process of deterioration with age.  >loss of a cell's power of division and growth  > >the process of aging with age  > the loss of a cellular's power to division and Growth  >  >The process or process deterioration with old age."", ""So if I sit down and move my eyes to the right, I'll feel queasiness?"", "">As has been mentioned, much of this is due to the way our eyes move (Saccade), and the way the brain processes eye movement (Sacciadic Suppression). If you want to simulate the smoothness of a non-saccadic movement, SIT DOWN FIRST (this can make people very dizzy), turn your head all the way to the right as you can with your eyes, then while holding your eyes as far right as they can go, move your head to the left. If you do it correctly, your eyes will stay as far to the RIGHT as they are and you won't track points with saccades so the movement should be very smooth.    If you sit down and move your eyes to the side, you'll notice that your eyes are moving a little bit to the sides, but you're not tracking points with your saccade. This is because your brain is still working out how to process the movement with your left eye, so it's using your right eye as a reference point. If your eyes were to move left, you'd notice a slight jiggling of your left leg, but if you move your left arm, you won't feel it. This happens because your body is still trying to figure out how it works with your right hand, so the body is trying to work out how the movements are supposed to work."", ""What about people who don't have saccadic suppression?"", 'Is it possible to ""fake"" a saccadic movement?', ""I think this is the best explanation I've read so far.    I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, but I'm still a little confused.  I know that the brain processes eye movement differently, but it still feels weird when I look at something that's moving away from me.  Like if I'm looking at a book and my eyes are moving away, it feels weird. Like I'm not quite sure what's happening.  But I'm trying to understand it."", ""Thanks for the answer!    I'm still a bit confused though, why does the image on my phone look so smooth when it's not?"", ""How do you feel when you're doing that?""]"
