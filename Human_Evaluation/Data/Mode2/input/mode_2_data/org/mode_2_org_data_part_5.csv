I\'m not sure if you\'re aware of this, but it\'s a Turing test that\'s used by Google to check whether you can solve a captcha.   It\'s a bit like a video game where you have to solve a video-game-like game to see if you can beat the computer.  There are a few ways to get around these, there are programs out there who are able to solve these tests successfully and seem human, but there have also been instances where humans have been paid to solve Captchas all day long.  I don\'t know if you\'ve seen the videos of the people solving the tests, but they\'re pretty impressive and it\'s not something you\'d expect a computer to be able to do.  Also, there have been cases where robots have been used to solve the tests as well, but those were pretty rare.  The Turing test is a bit of a stretch, but I think it\'s still a good test.  For example, there\'s a video of a bot solving a captcha using a series of images of stop signs.  It uses a combination of a human and a computer, and a series that uses a series (similar to how you\'d use a video clip to check if you are a human or a robot.  You can watch the video here:   The bot uses a computer and a human to solve it, and then shows you the results.  And there\'s also a video where a bot shows off the results and then asks you to watch it again.  This is a little bit like the Turing test, except instead of a video, you have a series where a computer shows you a series or a series and then a series in which you have the choice of whether to watch the videos again.', 'What about self driving cars?', 'Is there a way to fool the coder?', 'Can you explain the reasoning behind it?']"
