This is a bit of a stretch, but it’ll get you through the next few decades.  The fuel saved per passenger is a direct result of the increased efficiency of the engines.  So, if you can imagine a plane flying at 100% efficiency, you can probably get there in about 60 years.  But if you take a plane that uses 100% fuel efficiency, and you take it out on a cruise, you still need about the same fuel to get there.

How did this happen?    The answer is that technology has improved so much that the burning of fuel has decreased so much, that the amount of fuel burned has dropped so much the burning efficiency of fuel no longer matters.  The burning of fuels has dropped by so much because of the efficiency of the fuel used, that it no longer makes sense to burn more fuel.

I remember my dad (who worked for a major airline) commenting about how flights to Southern California took 45 minutes longer than when he started even though the planes were faster, all due to traffic and airport issues.
