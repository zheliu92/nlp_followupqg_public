We call them red, green, and blue because of where the strongest response is, but if someone has only green cones for some reason their eyes still respond perfectly well to pure red light - it'll just look like slightly less vivid light of whatever their perception is of the only color they can see.  When we see a particular color, our brain is doing a relatively complex computation - it looks at how much each cone is activated, and compares this to situational things like what color the illuminating light appears to be in a scene. To do this it necessarily has to already have assumptions about what colors make sense, to use as a reference.
