The most obvious is that in high concentrations it will pull water out of cells in the same way salt does. This isn’t the most significant however. Because the oxygen has two lone pairs on it these lone pairs can attack organic molecules in the organism/virus disrupting metabolic processes or outright destroying cell components. Further depending on the alcohol it can just dissolve cell parts. Recognize not all alcohols are equal.

These are basically fat molecules that are ordered in a specific way. When these come into contact with alcohol, the alcohol is able to, basically, dissolve the membrane because of how the alcohol and lipids interact. This causes the contents of the cell to leak into the environment, killing the cell. On top of that, the alcohol can also cause proteins to warp in ways that either render them useless or even harmful to the cell.
