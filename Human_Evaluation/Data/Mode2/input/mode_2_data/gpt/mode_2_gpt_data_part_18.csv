A cult is a religious organization based on control, who uses that control to remove negative influence about the cult towards the members to exert control over the belief system and remove rational thought about it.  Normal beliefs have a cycle to their creation:  1.  Idea - what is the thesis?  2.  Positive reinforcement - what are all the thoughts that support the idea?  3. Negative reinforcement - what are all the things that go against the thesis and make it not true?  4.  Reflection - weighing the positive against the negative in reflective thought  5.  Belief - what is your conclusion after considering the thesis from other angles and hearing from multiple perspectives on the issue.   Cults remove #3 and because of that you have no negative reinforcement. No negative and there is only positive going into reflection. So you get a fast track to belief.  A cult is anything where your beliefs must match the rest or you are berated, abused, or expelled from the group and the relationships with any members are based completely on your acceptance of said beliefs.', 'My father was a cult deprogrammer in the 1970’s and early 80’s.

Also the US norm of having insurance tied to your job creates problems.  A solution would be to decouple insurance from employment.

You’re someone young and healthy with no kids? Sure, here’s a plan that is dirt cheap, but doesn’t cover much beyond catastrophic accidents/illness.  You’re married and have 3 kids? Here’s a plan that costs a bit more and covers more.  You’re a hypochondriac that’s constantly convinced you’re dying?  Here’s a plan that covers everything imaginable, but you’re going to have to pay a lot for it.  Another option is tort reform for lawsuits.

This decreases the amount of people willing to assume that level of risk, meaning shortages.  Any time there’s a shortage, price goes up.  So reducing the ability to sue a doctor for millions of dollars for something that isn’t blatantly their incompetence (like an injury to mom or baby when giving birth, even if all protocols and good practices were followed) could help too, because then there’d be lower risk to such fields and more people would want to go into them, meaning wait times and price could go down.', 'The medical industry, and specifically the medical insurance industry is very heavily regulated.
