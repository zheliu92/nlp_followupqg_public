No. The opposite. The higher the pressure, the more likely the fluid will become liquid or even solid.  For the water example, you're trying to get the vapor pressure of the water to match the ambient pressure. If you're increasing the pressure, you're not increasing the vapor pressure, but the ambient pressure. You can only increase the vapor pressure of the water by heat. So if you increase the pressure in the container, like a pressure cooker, water must heat up further before it can boil; the vapor pressure has to go even higher than usual in order for it to meet the ambient (within the pressure cooker) pressure.  The same thing happens in the other direction for carbon dioxide. When the ambient pressure increases, the vapor pressure of the carbon dioxide is staying the same. Once the ambient pressure is higher than the vapor pressure, the carbon dioxide begins to condense into liquid; it is now below its boiling point."", "">Does that mean that as the pressure increases, a substance becomes more gaseous?

British National (Overseas) was a scheme originally implemented in the 80s/90s. As the handover from the UK to the PRC of Hong Kong was being discussed, there was a concern that HKers born in a British colony/territory would be forcibly stripped of protections they had as nominal British subjects. To counteract that, the UK proposed that everyone born in HK prior to a certain date would be eligible to be a BN(O), or British National (Overseas). This would give them some consular protections as a British subject, but not full citizenship rights. The idea was to allow those who did not want to live under the PRC to emigrate as if they were British citizens. Many did, finding homes in other ex-British territories like Australia and Canada. However, the handover agreement promised 50 years of autonomy to the HK government from the PRC, which eased many people's minds about remaining in HK or returning to HK after the handover.  This is being revived now in light of the anti-government/pro-democracy protests that started in 2019. The crackdown by the pro-PRC HK government, culminating in the 2020 National Security Law (NSL) forced by the PRC onto HK, was not favorably received by the UK and other western nations, being seen as a violation of the handover agreement that the UK had signed with the PRC in 1984. The revival of BN(O) is supposed to be a recourse from the UK to HKers; since the PRC isn't allowing HKers the 50 years of autonomy that they owed them, the UK will again extend the offer to emigrate from HK with much loosened restrictions. I am not certain on the details, but the eligibility has been greatly expanded compared to the original BN(O) offer.  The PRC has counteracted by not recognizing these BN(O) documents as travel documents. This is a bit of a hollow move, as most (if not all) HK residents have HK/PRC travel documents. They would simply use HK documents to pass through emigration controls in HK when departing, then use their BN(O) documents to enter the other country.  There are a few cases where someone who has been arrested for participating in the protests or violating the NSL and has had to surrender their HK/PRC travel documents as part of their bail/arrest conditions. These people would be most impacted by the lack of BN(O) recognition, as they would have no valid travel documents. However, since they are on bail, they would most likely be denied boarding/emigration anyway.  It matters now because many of the protests have currently been silenced, both by the NSL and by the pandemic, both in terms of legal restrictions (lockdowns, curfews, public gathering limits/bans) and public health concerns. Since many of those who have protested are unable to do so safely, the next available option for them is to simply emigrate if they no longer want to live under that government."", ""I will preface this wall of text by saying that I am very much in favor of the 2019-2020 protests, so please read this text with that in mind.
