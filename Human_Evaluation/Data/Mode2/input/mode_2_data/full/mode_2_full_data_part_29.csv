Rather, it allows the air on the other end to push by removing the air from the end inside of your mouth.  This means that, since there is only 1 atm of air, you're limited to that much pushing.  As water climbs the tube, gravity pulls it down, generating a pressure to counteract the pushing. This pressure depends solely on the density of water and the height at the top of the water.  So, solving for the density of water, we see that water can only get 10.4 meters above its surface from the action of atmospheric pressure. If the straw goes deeper than the water's surface, then the straw itself can be longer, but the water can only be raised above its surface by that amount.  The formula for hydrostatic pressure is quite straightforward. p = ρ g h  This is the pressure generated by gravity acting on the water, and it is the pressure that counteracts the pressure of air pushing up.
