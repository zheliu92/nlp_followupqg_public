If the conditions are just right the spores germinate and form mycelium which is the \'nervous and digestive system\' of of fungus. After the mycelium mat is firmly established, gets enough nutrients, is mature and the conditions are right the fruiting starts and mycelium produces fruit bodies known to us as mushrooms. The mushrooms produce spores in the gills (for the gilled ones of course) which fall from them in the hundreds of thousands per mushroom (it starts as soon as the mushroom cap opens), then are taken away by the wind and the whole cycle continues.
