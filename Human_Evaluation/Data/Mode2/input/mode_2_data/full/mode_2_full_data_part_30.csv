I think the point of your question lies in fart-transmission being different from fecal transmission. We know well that we can get sick from bacteria/viruses going from poop to another persons mouth and infecting them that way. You\'re suggesting an airborne transmission of an intestinal illness (I think).  1. The average amount of gas a human produces in a day is roughly 1L (per Google) 2. The average amount of air exhaled in a day is roughly 11,000L.  So from this we know that if a microorganism had to choose spreading via farting which is to say by airborne transmission, that\'s 11,000 times *less efficient* than just going straight through the lungs. We also know that microorganisms generally infect/attack the place they are released from, so an intestinal infection prefers to attack the intestine which means it needs to be eaten, not inhaled. *It is possible* to get intestinal infections in your lungs and lung infections in your intestines in certain cases but this isn\'t common, it\'s not the preferred method of transmission.  We can also assume that most farts are filtered through underwear and pants, which is similar to wearing a face mask, it\'ll filter out many of the particulates that microorganisms ride on. So let\'s assume transmission from fart, through clothes, into the lungs is yet further unlikely.  In the end, this doesn\'t pass the sniff test (...ha), it\'s just too circuitous to be an intentional transmission route. Much easier for the illness to spread via direct fecal contamination, in fact that\'s really, really easy.  However, a quick google search gives an affirmative ""Not Completely Impossible"" as there are demonstrated cases of Cholera (an intestinal illness) infecting the lungs of people with immune disorders. In this case, it\'s most likely a case of dirty-surface fecal contamination being introduced to the lungs via touching the nose/mouth and *inhaling the feces* but still, it\'s credible.
