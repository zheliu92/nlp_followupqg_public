Imagine many slices of cheese, each with some holes in random positions. Each slice of cheese represents one entity in the engineering project, and holes represent safety holes in that one entity. A risk factor (hole) in one entity can be blocked by another entity. However, sometimes you're unlucky and all the holes align. Everything is at the wrong place at the same time, and disaster happens.   Truth is, humans *will* make mistakes. It is unavoidable. Any attempts to reduce risk *will* cause risks of its own. The best we can do is to have many layers of cheese (safety mechanism) so that the chance of holes aligning (all safety mechanisms failing) is as small as possible. The desire to blame a single entity for disasters is not only wrong, but also makes the entire system prone to future disasters. If we only blame one slice of cheese for the entire disaster, problems in every other slice of cheese is not fixed, or even worse, those holes get larger due to complacency."", ""In engineering risk assessment there is a theory called the cheese model.

The object simply exists and has this effect.  Transfer of energy would mean that the energy is being transferred from the object to the observer.  The observer is just a thing that exists, just like the air is just air. Transfer of a significant amount of energy requires a process called energy transfer.   If the object is just an object that exists and moves in space, then transfer of the energy would be no problem.  If it were a moving object that moved in a direction that required energy, then the transfer would be from the observer to the moving object.  But since it's just a small object that moves in a certain direction, there's no reason it should require energy.  In fact, it's the opposite: the movement of the object towards the observer causes the energy to be transferred from that point to the object."", 'Can you explain the concept of a gravitational field and its role in the conservation of mass?', 'What is the role of the brainstem in initiating the transition from wakefulness to sleep?', 'Can you explain what is meant by ""rapid brain activity"" during sleep transition?', 'How does the brain normally regulate internal body temperature during sleep?', 'Why might a sudden awakening occur during a hypnic jerk?']"
