Down syndrome, for instance, is caused by a *trisomy* (three chromosome copies) of the 21st chromosome (we all have 23 chromosome pairs that scientists have labeled with numbers 1-23).  Down syndrome is always caused by trisomy of the 21st chromosome, but there are other trisomies that are compatible with life and lead to different symptoms, such as trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome).

If gravity is a product of that relationship, does that even imply that gravity isn’t a force?  I understand how gravity works as objects traveling along straight paths through curved space to intersect but it is far more complicated than that. The more I look into it, the less I feel that I get it.', '> Changing the shape of spacetime, which is what gravity does  This is where I get fucked up in regards to gravity. Is it that gravity warps spacetime or is gravity the result of spacetime being warped by mass? They say that gravity is a force but one of those options seems to me to suggest that gravity is more a product of the relationship between mass and spacetime.
