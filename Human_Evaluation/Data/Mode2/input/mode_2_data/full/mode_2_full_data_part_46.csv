The selective membrane approach for separating a gas from the atmosphere definitely works.  That\'s how oxygen concentrators work to help people with breathing issues without tanks of oxygen.  The Orca plant will be able to remove 3000-4000 tons per year.  That\'s 250 Americans worth of CO2.  It\'s not nothing, but it\'s not much.  It\'s only environmental because it has a renewable power source, power it by most electric sources and its a net polluter.  It\'s expensive, and that\'s also a problem.  However, the biggest problem is that it leaves you with CO2 gas.  What are you going to do with that?  They have this notion of storing it underground and hoping it never, ever leaks out.
