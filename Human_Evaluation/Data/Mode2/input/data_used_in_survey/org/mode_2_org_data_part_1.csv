Does this mean that the sound is not being played correctly?', 'What about the Green Needle?', 'So the question is, why does the sound have a hanging frequency?', 'But why does the background frequency hang?', 'How does it work?', 'Thanks for your answer!    But what about the Ben 10 song?  Does it have any relation to the real world?', ""So if I see a white light in the air, it's not reflecting from another source?"", 'How do we know that it’s not reflecting from another source?', ""So if the object is so hot that it's absorbing the light, then how is it still reflecting?"", 'Is it possible to heat a torch up to a certain temperature and still see the light?', 'I see, but what about the black body radiation?', "">For serious injury this can basically kill you because you eventually don't have enough blood to keep the heart or brain Alive.    This is why you put pressure on a wound or you tourniquet the area so that blood just can't flow to that extremity.  This also means platelets are going to clot and block where you are bleeding to eventually stabilize.<QUS>"", 'How does the heart know how much blood to pump?', 'Thanks for your answer!    Does this mean that if I were to lose a lot of blood, my heart would beat faster to pump it to my brain?', 'What about head injuries?', "">If you track 7 points, that's a 7-dimensional vector! Way more complicated than tiny little 4D quaternion.   What is a quaternions?"", 'So if I have a vector of 3d lines and rotate it once, it will turn into a 3d quaternion?', ""So if I have 7 points and rotate them left to right, how do I know that I'm in the correct quadrant?"", 'I think that\'s the key.    I\'m not sure what you mean by ""3 components"".   The rotation is defined by the third component.  The fourth component is used to determine the degree of rotation.  So, if you have a 3d vector, you can rotate it in any direction.  But if you want to rotate it out to a 4d vector you need to use a fourth component.', ""I see. So it's just a rotation problem?""]"
