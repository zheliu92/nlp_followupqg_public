                        explanations for real-life questions.

                    <p>We gathered (question, answer) pairs from this forum, along with replies to those answers. Often,
                        these replies include follow-up questions. For this task, we selected follow-up questions and
                        formatted each data entry as a triple of (initial question, answer, follow-up question). </p>

                    <p>For each HIT, you will be shown one triple (question, answer, follow-up question). Carefully

                    <p>Why do seahorses still existed?</p>

                    <p>That’s not how evolution works. Evolution is survival of the fittest, not survival of the most useful. Seahorses will keep existing as long as they have food and reproduce faster than they are hunted.</p>

                    <p>Reason: “Seahorses will keep existing, really?" is in question format but is invalid, because it is not asking information but just expressing suspicious feeling.</p>

                    <h4><b>Initial Question:</b></h4>
                    <p>Why do tapes have screen tearing and splitting, but modern media doesn’t?</p>
                    <h4><b>Initial Answer:</b></h4>
                    <p>Information on a VHS was an analog signal. To fit all of it on a tape in a linear form would end up with miles of tape. So they record the information in diagonal stripes across the tape, which is much wider than it would need to be if it just held a single track. This is then played back through a spinning head that is placed at the same angle relative to the tape as the information on it. The tape moves by the head as the head spins, reading each stripe in a fluid motion, creating the smooth video you see on playback. Pausing it stops the tape moving, but not the spinning head. So the image you see is whatever that spinning head is reading, repeated over and over. Hence the "between frames" effect.</p>
                    <h4><b>Follow-up Question:</b></h4>
                    <p>That’s right, I remember watching a Technology Connections video about how the head itself had to be skewed because of that. I remember as a kid looking inside the VCR and wondering “what is that thing, is it broken?” Now I know.</p>

                    <h4><b>Reason For Being Invalid</b></h4>
                    <p>Reason: “what is that thing, is it broken?" is just the questioner’s memory, not a question asking information in the original question or the answer.</p>

                    <p>ELI5: Why is the sea calm in the mornings?</p>
                    <h4><b>Initial Answer:</b></h4>
                    <p>There are two types of waves which can turn a flat sea into a rougher one - swell waves and wind waves. Swell waves can arrive at any time of day, but because wind waves are generated by the wind, they only develop when the wind begins to blow steadily. Since wind speeds are often low at night, and increase during the daytime, wind waves often die out during the night, leading to a relatively flat sea (perhaps with swell waves) in the early morning. During the day, the wind waves increase in size as the wind speed increases, leading to a rougher, more choppy, sea surface during the afternoon and evening.</p>
                    <h4><b>Follow-up Question:</b></h4>
                    <p>Now it’s time for my question. Why are winds always weak in the morning and very strong during the day?</p>

                    <h4><b>Reason For Being Valid</b></h4>
                    <p>Reason: The follow-up question is a “Why” question, asking specific reasons about the change of the winds during the day. Therefore, it is a valid question.</p>

                    <p>ELI5: Do Asexual people not feel orgasms or pleasure?</p>

                    <h4><b>Initial Answer:</b></h4>
                    <p>Asexual people don’t feel sexual attraction. That is, the thing that makes a sexual person look at someone else and think "I want to have sex with that person". Asexual people can still feel sexual desire or sexual arousal, but it usually won’t be targeted towards someone in particular. I had an asexual roommate, and she did feel sexual arousal, but didn’t feel sexual attraction. So, in the rare time that she masturbated, she would be able to become aroused by porn or sexual material, but her arousal wasn’t centered in imagining herself performing the actions or having those actions performed on her.</p>

                    <p>Is it like, how? Do their brains work in a way that disallows them of sexual thinking? I don’t mean anything bad, believe me, but I can’t understand how something as primal and ingrained in our genes as reproducing is nullified by a factor of personality.</p>

                    <h4><b>Initial Answer:</b></h4>
                    <p>Various possible methods. If someone inadvertently shared their 2fa setup key (or a situation like having their phone stolen and the authentication app backed up), that could be used alongside the original password to gain access. SIM swapping is another possible tactic assuming the first password and the victim's cell phone number are already known: if the attacker calls the carrier and requests a replacement SIM/ESIM delivered to the attacker, the attacker could then take advantage of any voice/text message 2fa prompts.</p>

                    <h4><b>Follow-up Question:</b></h4>

                    <p>Reason: The follow-up question is asking for elaboration on the solutions about how to prevent a SIM swap, and “SIM swap” appears in the answer. In addition, there is no other new information in the follow-up, and thus it can be considered as strongly related.</p>

                    <p>They’re kind of like digital trading cards. You buy a thing that represents a digital thing (an image or tweet or whatever else), and then you can turn around and sell that token for hopefully more money than you paid for it. Some important things to note:

                        <li>Owning the token provides you with no practical rights to the thing (for example, you can’t prevent others from using or displaying it).</li>
                        <li>The token is safe from counterfeiting because it’s backed by the block-chain (no one else can steal your token or produce a fake one).</li>

                    <p>Turning something off brings it back to a known good state, and powering it up puts it through a known good set of steps.

                    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Not Related Follow-up Questions Example</h3>

                    <h4><b>Initial Question:</b></h4>
                    <p>ELI5: Why does light get absorbed in black holes if photons are massless?</p>

                    <h4><b>Initial Answer:</b></h4>
                    <p>Photons are “massless”, but not really. They’re still physical and can be impacted by gravity. This is why light can ‘curve’ around a dense object like a planet. Black Holes have crazy amounts of gravity, and literally trap light inside.</p>

                    <h4><b>Follow-up Question:</b></h4>
                    <p>Theory on Newton’s law?</p>

                    <h4><b>Reason For Being Not Related:</b></h4>
                    <p>Reason: Newton’s law is unrelated to the original question and its answer. The follow-up question introduces a new topic (Newton's law), which has no connection to the concepts discussed in the initial question about light and black holes. Therefore, it can be considered as "NOT RELATED" to the given answer.</p>
