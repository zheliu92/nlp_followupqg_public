    "question": "ELI5: How does an internal clock within a DSLR/computer camera work?",
    "answer": "For some weird reason, if you apply electricity to certain crystals, they vibrate with fairly consistent frequencies.   We can make devices that count the number of times the crystal has vibrated. So if the crystal is one that vibrates roughly 16,000 times per second, we can connect that counter to a device that counts up to 16,000 then sends a signal. Every signal represents 1 second passing. Now that we have a device that can count seconds (or fractions of a second), we can make a clock! (This is how digital watches work!)  So basically DSLRs and computers have tiny digital watches inside without a screen.   This isn't always super accurate. Cheaper crystals and mechanisms aren't exactly perfect. If I leave my Nintendo Switch disconnected from the internet, it's usually 2-3 minutes off of the \"correct\" time within 24 hours. That's why most computers and devices today have an option to either use internet time services or GPS to keep their time updated. GPS and internet time services use SUPER accurate clocks to keep time, so periodically syncing with them keeps the device \"on time enough\".",

    "answer": "This is why you can turn the sail. You orient the sail so that it catches the wind, and then you have a centerboard which is a big flat piece of material sticking down into the water from the bottom of the boat.  The centerboard helps transfer directional force on the sail into forward motion for the ship because it only wants to move through the water the skinny way.",

    "answer": "When Tesla said \u201cthink of\u201d he meant rigorously. Tesla thought in ways that created functioning machines - ie rigorous and realistic ways.    I would recommend taking courses on the resonant frequency of structures, on signal theory, on physics where energy calculations are used, things like potential energy and energy flux.    If you\u2019re in college, find these courses in the syllabus. Or if you\u2019re not in STEM and don\u2019t know where to start, go to a STEM student or prof and help them find you classes where you\u2019ll learn about those things: resonant frequency, signals, energy-based physics (such as calculating the height a roller coaster will go based on potential energy instead of based on velocity and acceleration), thermodynamics, waves.    And if you\u2019re \u201cbad at math\u201d, change your self-conception and push yourself to get better. Math is about practice more than it is about talent. And math is necessary to really, truly appreciate the beauty of these ways of thinking. So make friends with math.    If you\u2019re not at a university, use Khan academy or any university\u2019s free online courses to study this stuff.     The key point is to study it rigorously - this means homework and math, not just reading a popular science book about the mysteries of the universe.    Just like a musician needs to play his scales, someone who wants to experience the beauty that Tesla is referring to needs to do his math homework.",

When you say they are all the same pitch you are saying they have the same fundamental frequency, but they will have different levels of harmonics that all add up to make the voice's waveform.So the difference between men and a women singing the same exact note and sounding markedly different is due to the amplitude (strength) and phase (delay) of the harmonics that the voices also creates, that have frequencies of 2x, 3x, 4x, etc the fundamental frequency.  EDIT : I just realized OP asked for biological answer, then there's already some explanation on another comment. My answer is more like physics and mathematics.

Water is a bit of a glue and sticks to materials, unlike other liquids such as liquid [mercury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiWlthrtneU) for example.  Your hands get wet because water sticks to them (like a glue); your hands will NOT get wet if you stick  them in mercury.  But water won't stick to flour, it's too porous, and will thus \"roll off\" the flour area / prep area, if it's flat.

When leaving, you just launch when the orbital capsule is at peak target distance. Then you hook up and fire the rockets from very little gravity and begin the trip home. Once you reach earth you do have a target range but your flight is calculated to take you right to the ocean where ships are waiting.

The second is that it's left over material from the formation of Saturn that never fell into Saturn but was too close to form into a moon in the first place (because of the Roche limit)  They first means the rings weren't always there, and their age would be unknown and thus it's possible they may decay at some point.  The second means the rings were always there, and are stable enough to last 4.5 billions years, implying they are going nowhere.

    "answer": "There are two answers. Neither of them very clear. One personally, and two society-wise. Both depend on risk. The first to your self , the second as a group.   Your risk is based on how likely you are to actually cross paths with someone infectious and how likely that is to cause you serious harm. So are you in an at risk group and where are you are considerations.   The second - how likely you are to be part of a chain of infection, how at risk are the people around you and how well society - such as the health service is coping.   Masks not perfect and life always holds a risk. In the West we have never masked up for flu which kills thousands of people a year - around 20,000 in the U.K. annually I think - though we vaccinate the at risk. Possibly COVId may have some nasty long term consequences even if you dint get seriously ill. But if the consequences of COVID dropped to equivalent to flu , then it would hardly be unreasonable to behave in a similar way. I say that nit to suggest we wait till then ( if it ever happened) but as a comparative starting point. No one can really say at what precise point in infections and consequences between that \u2018flu\u2019 point and the worst of COVID is the point at which we are \u2018safe\u2019.   I expect government ps will come up with a balance of infection rates, hospitalisations and economics with a dose of politics.   Bear in mind that in the East people regularly wear masks on public transport so as either not to do catch viruses or not to spread them , I guess it\u2019s just considered normal hygiene even for colds.   That\u2019s a long winded way of saying that presuming you are not mandated by the governments and pretty much everyone has had access to a vaccine you will have to decide whether you feel either at risk yourself, or feel that you need to still protect other people.

Some people have obvious triggers like certain foods or stresses, others are more of a mystery.  If I get a migraine, that is me often shut down for a day or more - the auras starting give me only a few minutes to stop doing things like driving before it becomes dangerous, and then I can be left dealing with the headache and vomiting for a significant period and unable to do anything else other than hiding in bed and trying to sleep through as much as possible.

This is a mathematical technique which lets us look at a wave, let's say the sound of a lion's roar, and instead of looking at how it changes over time (like having a loud beginning, slowly getting quieter, and a few grumbles at the end), asking what other waves it is made of.  That feels like a big jump, but it's simpler than you think. Sticking with sound, you may know that the pitch of a sound is determined by something called it's frequency. This is mostly true, but it's not the full picture. Sounds are made up of lots and lots of frequencies all added together. This is what makes a violin sound different to a flute if they're playing the same note. What this means is that if you take a very simple wave which genuinely only has a single frequency, called a sine wave, and start adding very special amounts of other waves of very specific frequencies, you can actually build sounds from scratch - this is called \"additive synthesis\", by the way.  What the Fast Fourier Transform does is tell you exactly what amount of *all* frequencies have gone into making whatever wave it's looking at. This is sometimes called a \"decomposition\", because it is looking at what the wave is composed of.  Why is it associated with ghost hunters?

    "question": "[ELI5] Is flying a plane hard? In terms of difficulty, is it comparable to driving a car?",
    "answer": "It really depends on what type of plane your are talking about and the level of auto pilot that your plane has. But regardless yes it is more difficult than a car:  Controls: Steering is far more like a boat than like car only you have elevation as well. I'm sure other redditors will go into greater detail but your controls are far more complex and if you are relying on the auto pilot you need to understand how to read and program that specific autopilot exactly. You can't learn to fly a Boeing 737-400 and then go fly a Boeing 737-800 - you'd have to go specifically retrain (Boeing 737NG course).  Navigation: In a car you are driving on a road with road markings and road signs and nowadays with extremely an useful GPS lady to guide you along. A huge part of flying is navigating as there's no signs up in the air to guide you along. And with weather conditions you have to learn to navigate by instrumentation alone.  Radio: This is the reason I could never be a pilot - I do not understand what is being said over the radio and you cannot fly safely without having proper communication and radio discipline. You have to be listening closely at **all** times because there's no way to fly safely without listening out for air traffic control constantly.  Safety: If your aircraft experiences any problem in air you can't simple pull over and open the hood. Therefore every single of aspect of flying involves safety checks and doublechecks. And these are not things that you can skip like when you pull your car out in the morning and you don't checked for punctures. You must follow specific checklists each flight in particular order.",

    "answer": "Earth travels in a circle around the Sun. Each lap around the sun takes 1 year, or 365 days. Every day, the Earth spins 1 time. We see the sun during the day when the part of Earth we are on is facing the sun, and we cannot see the sun at night because we are facing away from it.  The moon travels in circles around the Earth just like Earth travels around the sun. However, the moon o ly takes 1 month, or about 30 days, to make 1 lap around Earth.  We can see the moon at night some days and during the day other days because the sun and moon move across our sky at different speeds, so the times we see each one don't exactly match up.  Think of two racecars going around a circle track. If one car goes a little faster than the other, we will see it pass in front of us more times than the other car.

    "question": "ELI5: Can there be a machine that\u2019s an \u201canti-lightbulb\u201d?",
    "answer": "There are two answers to this question: No, because light doesn't work that way; *or* Yes, but it's Complicated.  On the \"no\" side, you have the fact that light, as a form of energy, can neither be created nor destroyed. It just moves around from place to place. (This is called the \"conservation of energy.\" For complicated math reasons, the fact that physics works the same if you \"run\" time forwards or backwards *requires* that energy cannot be destroyed.) So, as others have said, you could use something like a black hole to suck up light, but that's just shunting the light into that space, which isn't really the anti-lightbulb with a darkness aura around it like you are asking for.  On the \"yes\" side, there is a very complex, very difficult way that could *theoretically* work, but it would require much more advanced technology than we possess. This is because light is made of tiny wave-packets, which we call photons. Each photon, theoretically, has a perfect equal and opposite: one with the same amplitude, but exactly reversed peaks and troughs (high and low ponts) in the wave. If these waves meet perfectly, so each high part of one wave is exactly where the corresponding low part of the other wave is, then the effect is cancelled out, and it will be as if there is no photon present at all. Then they will pass by each other and be detectable again. If--and this is a very BIG if--you could make a device that could *exactly* match the incoming photons with its own outgoing photons, you could make an anti-lightbulb that would create a halo of unlit space around itself. This would be very, very difficult however, and we probably do not have computers good enough to calculate which light needs to go where *fast enough* to make one work, even in an extremely rigidly controlled environment.  However, while doing this with *light* is very hard, doing it with *sound* is actually (sort of) possible! As an example, think of being at a concert, where the same sound waves are being sent out of two different speaker units. If those speaker units are positioned correctly, there will be points where the sound waves from one speaker will exactly cancel out the sound waves of the other speaker, meaning a microphone at that point would hear (effectively) silence. The effect is not perfect silence normally, because in the real world, objects have volume, whereas the place where the waves cancel out is (in theory) a single point. But you can absolutely experience these points of silence in the real world! You can also get the exact opposite phenomena, where sound gets reinforced to become louder than it would be otherwise, because the two waves *stack* their high parts right on top of each other (same for the low parts).  The formal physics term for waves that cancel out is \"destructive interference\" (the two waves combine to make a \"weaker\" wave), and for waves that amplify it's called \"constructive interference\" (the two waves combine to make a \"stronger\" wave).",

It's not that there's less water overall, it's just that changing weather patterns changes where the water is going, which is places were it's either not needed or inaccessible.   For example, less winter snow in the Rocky Mountains means less spring and summer water in the Colorado River watershed which provides water for much of The Southwestern U.S., eventually emptying in the Pacific. At the same time, Typhoons in the pacific are getting bigger and more frequent, so there's more water being dumped back into the ocean. In other words, water that used to fall as snow in the Rockies is now falling as rain in the Pacific Ocean where it's unusable. That's a simplistic explanation but you get the drift.",

It seems to me that this is less secure than an old chipless card that at least requires a PIN.",
    "answer": "The chip and/or the PIN are a means of verifying the transaction is legit.  On a card without the chip, the only data is its number, the expiration date, and maybe the verification code on the back. The magnetic stripe is usually just the card number. These kinds of terminals require the PIN because (hopefully) only the authorized cardholder knows that PIN. These cards are easy to duplicate so we NEED extra security measures.  Cards with a chip, on the other hand, are a lot harder to replicate. The chip is actually a tiny computer that does some math on some inputs and generates numbers in a way that isn't easy to guess even if you see it done for a few thousand inputs. The bank who issues the card knows the secret information that makes it possible to predict the numbers. So, oversimplified, when you use a chip reader, the terminal gives the chip some inputs, gets the chip's result, then sends the inputs and the results to the bank. The bank verifies that the inputs should produce that output on your chip. So in a way, the chip IS the PIN, but it's more secure than that because you can't accidentally give someone knowledge that makes them able to replicate your chip.  It's probably possible to copy a card with a chip, but it would take a high degree of sophistication and someone would have to physically steal your card to do it. You can't reproduce the chip from observing a single read, and in theory even seeing hundreds of thousands of input/output wouldn't be useful. Because it's incredibly close to impossible to duplicate these chips, when a terminal uses the chip as an ID you don't have to use a PIN. The assumption is it means someone would've had to have stolen your actual card and you'd probably notice that much more quickly than it takes to figure out someone's skimmed a traditional card.",

You do have the legal right to take the property, however you have limited power to use any force. So if the person sees you about to repo their car, and decides to jump into the car, you can not physically remove them. You also can not tow the car with them inside it. If you can block the car from leaving it\u2019s current location then you have every right to call the police, and they will gladly force the person to get out, and assist you with the repo. This sounds great but the downside is that you have to stay with the car until the police arrive. This could take an hour or more.

    "question": "eli5: Why do commonly used items, such as CRT's or old consoles skyrocket in value after they stop production? Assuming that these items stopped production today, why do sealed boxes or hell even good condition second-hand items almost double in price mere weeks after the end of production?",
    "answer": "CRTs have some advantages over LCDs and other flat-panel display technologies that matter for certain niche applications. To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That's more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don't care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it's turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.  Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you're dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0). So e.g. if you really want to buy a NES today, your options are very limited as you're dependent on the ever-decreasing number of NES's in the world that still work, *and* that people are willing to sell. So even though very few people are looking to buy NES's, the supply is even smaller.  I'm not sure it's accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I'm happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up. Also, often consoles that go out of production are superseded by newer models and the bulk of the demand will switch to them, while the collectors' market will take years to get off the ground. The only exception I can think of would be if the manufacturer (for some atypical reason) stopped producing the console before they had exhausted the (profitable) demand for it (and didn't release a new console yet).",

    "answer": "Because the more data that can be collected about you, the more \"they\" know about you; who you are, your age, what you like, where you go, when you get paid and most importantly, what keeps you looking at a screen.  Why do they want you to look at a screen? You may ask.  Advertising.  Companies want to make money, and in order to do this they need to let people know about their products. But advertising your products costs a lot of money when you are trying to reach a wider audience.  So they target specific demographics.  Where before, they would've advertised on a certain website, or in a certain area, advertisers can now target specific people. People they know like the kind of things they are selling. People of a particular age and gender who like to purchase products similar to yours.  By targeting more specifically, they have more chance of making a sale per dollar spent on advertising. So companies who harvest data from us sell it to 3rd party advertisers. And with the amount of people putting their entire lives online, and the amount of money that can be made from selling stuff to them, means it's a big money business.  Then there's the illegal side of the industry.  Your private data, such as passwords and credit card details, the kind of stuff that is kept hidden (or encrypted) online, is very valuable to cyber criminals who can buy such data on the dark web. They may want phone numbers or email addresses to try and scam through phishing emails etc. Or buy credit card details to commit fraud.

    "answer": "So, this works on roughly the same principle as the GPS receiver built into your phone.  If I give you a map and tell you that I'm fifteen miles away from this particular point, then you can map out a thirty-mile-wide circle where I can be anywhere along the circumference.  If I give you another point and say that I'm a certain distance away from *that* point as well, you can narrow down where I could be based on the intersection of the two circles.  A third point/distance pair is sufficient to get a single approximate location, and further pairs refine the location further, as well as providing redundancy in case of signal loss.  This is, broadly speaking, the purpose of the pulsar map on the Pioneer plaque (and the Voyager record, as well): fourteen mapped pulsars, with distances and frequencies attached, would give a sufficiently-advanced alien species all the information they would need to locate our solar system in space.",

    "answer": "Freedom of speech does have certain limitations in particular inciting violence or threat. Its illegal to threaten to kill someone but remember that its that call to arms that's illegal. The words \"I'm going to kill you\" is not illegal because you can say it sarcastically, as a quote, or as an example as I just did. However, if you say \"I'm going to kill you\" then include a date, time, how you plan on doing it, etc then it becomes illegal.  Similarly, the argument for freedom of speech cannot be used to defend illegal market manipulation, fraud, insider trading, etc. It is the action that is illegal not the words. Market manipulation is illegal because only a few can benefit from it. In your example Warren Buffet says \"you should buy company X's stock\" so a bunch of people buy it and increase the stock value and then Warren could pull all of his money out and make a ton of money but plummeting the stock price. That would effectively be stealing from the company and the people he told to buy the stock.  Pump and dump like that is very different than typical stock increases because it is not based on an intrinsic value. It is only increasing in value due to a perceived demand based on stock sales but has no relevance to the performance of the company. And while the process of buy low sell high in a short term is not illegal it brings a lot more risk to the table and not really considered \"investing\" but more betting/gambling on the stock market.",
