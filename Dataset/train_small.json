    "question": "eli5: how do allergies exist?",
    "answer": "So your antibodies go through this randomization event in hopes of being able to \u201clatch\u201d onto a foreign substance, such as a certain type of bacteria. But they can\u2019t latch onto all different types of bacteria, just that specific type it ended up being made for. Let\u2019s pretend the \u201ccode\u201d the antibody to recognize bacteria A is 123. 123 is created for ridding the body of bacteria A.   Now let\u2019s say an antibody with the code 567 is made. This one might end up recognizing the proteins in peanuts that causes the allergy. So your body thinks this substance is a foreign entity it must get rid of and your humoral immune system (B cells) will work with your cellular immune system (T cells) to get rid of this substance.  In terms of severity of allergy (uncomfortable vs life threatening), I can\u2019t remember for sure but I want to say they\u2019re still investigating that. The immune system is super complex and genetics and environment can definitely influence its development. One can also ask why does a common cold virus affect person A more severely than person B. There\u2019s a lot going on with your immune cells scientists are still trying to figure out.",

To my understanding With the advanced premium credit, you\u2019ll get X amount of credit taken off your taxes at the end of the year. I don\u2019t know what it is in exact numbers, and it might vary on case to case. But let\u2019s say it\u2019s 600 dollars.  Because it\u2019s an \u201cadvance premium\u201d, you can choose to take that credit \u201cin advance\u201d instead of waiting until it\u2019s time to pay taxes. Now the government doesn\u2019t give you the cash directly, but instead uses that money to decrease your monthly healthcare payments.

    "question": "ELI5: What is the actual purpose of AC power?",
    "answer": "Electric generators and motors can use dc or ac, not both.  DC generators and motors need brushes to catch the power from the spinning part, and this brushes require big big maintenance. When AC was discovered, it allowed to make generators and motors at 2/3 of the price of a DC one, and they are completely maintenance free, because they don\u2019t need a brush system. So they won, and were adopted in mass.  Not having brushes allows to produce higher voltages without issues. Higher voltage allows to  transfer the same power using thinner wires, this makes transport and the generator parts to be done with thin cheaper wires, saving even more money.  Then the power transport in cables has losses along the line, electrons flow heats the cables, with high voltage, you can transport power by moving fewer electrons but with higher force in each of them. So again, another win for high voltage systems, and again high voltage production is easier if done in AC. There are DC high voltage lines, for example, submarine cables and nation to nation lines may be high voltage DC; not so common but it\u2019s done sometime, for example, a country with 115v 50hz AC may transform it to DC to sell it to another country that then transforms it into its own 220V 60hz AC. This is done because the 2 different AC systems are completely incompatible, because both need to transform it, they may have a DC line between them.  Add in that illumination can be done with DC or AC without difference.   Basically the only drawback for AC is computers. Computers need low voltage DC. So we use an AC line for everything, and transform it to low voltage DC only in the devices that need it. Another thing that can\u2019t work in AC are batteries, so any system that has a battery needs to be DC. This doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t do a AC system with a DC conversion between system and battery, sometime it\u2019s done, it\u2019s overly expensive but may be done.",

    "answer": "Some people are better at memorising than others. Also, some people are better at reading sheet music than others. Personally, I find it much easier to read sheet music quickly than to memorise pieces.  Some classical musicians absolutely can memorise long and complicated pieces of music. However, it can be useful to have the sheet music in front of you just in case, even if you don't need to read it. For many classical musicians, the sheet music acts more like a quick memory jogger to remember what the next section is, so that you can then pour your effort into playing that as expressively as necessary.  There are definitely some instruments that are more difficult than others, but this can be for a variety of reasons. As a flautist, I can only play one note at a time, so it's arguably a much simpler instrument than piano or any stringed instrument. At the same time, I don't have as much option for relying on muscle memory. On the piano, you can get used to the way your hands move to play a phrase, and the same for guitar - but on the flute, there's not the same \"easy\" muscle memory for being able to play the next phrase without thinking about. (I'm sure a better flautist than I am might disagree with me about this, but I struggled with the muscle memory for playing phrases on the flute much more than I ever did with the keyboard, guitar, or drums.) As a result, the sheet music can be quite helpful as an aid when the muscle memory isn't as well developed for playing a piece.  Finally, it might just be down to convention and habit. Classical musicians almost always have their sheet music handy, so they almost always put it in front of them. Guitarists often practise without sheet music, so they don't feel as much need to put it in front of them.",

    "question": "ELI5: what is the European Super League and why does everyone hate it?",
    "answer": "Let me try and explain the European club football pyramid:  First, the most important point: All professional football teams in Europe play under the same umbrella, that is called UEFA. UEFA runs the highest club competition in Europe, called the UEFA Champions League, whose winner is the European champion. The teams that will play in any given year's Champions League are the previous year's winners of the national leagues of European nations.  Oh, yes, the national leagues: Parallel to the Champions League, every nation also has its own leagues. England has its own, called the Premier League, my country Turkey has the S\u00fcper Lig, etc. The qualification process varies by country depending on that country's teams' previous performance, but by winning the national league, any team in any given European country could go and get to play in the Champions League, and win it and become the European champions if they are good enough.  Each nation has lower divisions of their leagues too, but those divisions are all interconnected with the top division. At the end of each season, the top teams in lower divisions switch places with the bottom teams in the higher division, a process known as 'promotion and relegation'. This ensures that, if I and a bunch of my friends decided to form a team in our Turkish town tomorrow, after enough victories in the following years, we could theoretically get promoted to the Turkish S\u00fcper Lig, win that, go to the Champions League, win that, and become the European champions. Improbable, sure, but theoretically not impossible. By winning enough games for a long enough time, any team could win the Champions League.  Every other continent also has a similar system to determine their continental champion. Every year, the winners from all 6 continents play in the  FIFA Club World Cup. The winner is crowned the world champion.  Now these 12 rich teams owned by bastards have decided to bypass this whole system by creating their own league in place of the Champions League. They seem to like the American system of 'closed league', where the owners of teams decide who gets to play, where even after years of horrendous performance you just continue to be part of the competition, where new teams (which are referred to as 'franchises', ugh) have to ask for permission from the league to be part of it.  This would make the entirety of European leagues pointless. Sure, the national leagues would continue to exist, but with no way of joining this 'Super League' besides invitation, and no way for the 'founding clubs' to ever not qualify for it, pretty much all the excitement of European football is being stolen.",

    "answer": "Solder is a eutectic mixture which means it has a property better than any of its components.  Leaded solder (commonly 63% lead, 37% tin) will melt at 183C while Lead melts at 327C and Tin melts at 232C so that's a big drop.  You can tweak the melting point and some strength parameters by adjusting the mix but there are a few happy points.  A common lead free solder is SAC 305 which is 97% tin, 3% silver, and 0.5% copper, the mix of metals helps give it the right properties  The ideal mixture comes down to how everything interacts to form little metallic crystals  When you solder something its not like glue where there's material A, layer of glue, material B, there's actually an interface layer.  If you're soldering a copper wire to a gold pad there will be gold, layer of gold/tin/other solder bits that transition from pure gold to pure solder, then layer of solder, then tin/copper/solder mix as it bonds to the wire, then just the copper wire.  Its this \"intermetallic\" layer where the solder and the material being connected have created a new alloy that makes the joints strong.  For lead free solder, mixing a tiny bit of silver in results in a better crystal structure than just tin with a bit of copper would",

Taken alone, it seems arbitrary and boring, but the ratio of each number pair gets closer and closer to a very special number in nature called phi (pronounced fee), which is also known as the golden or divine ratio.  Just as the greek letter pi represents the (approximate) value of 3.14 and is a special number relating to the circumference of circles, phi, which represents a value around 1.6,  has an odd way of showing up in all sorts of natural phenomena. We see this ratio in spirals, such as the spiral of a hurricane, the spiral of the milky way galaxy, or even snail shells. We see it in the proportions of our own anatomy: the ratio of the successive digits of your fingers, or of your hand to your forearm is approximately 1.6 etc. There are many more examples if you do a Google image search for the golden ratio.  Then universality of this relationship lead philosophers to regard it as almost like gods calling card, an artifact of the divine source code that created the natural world (hence the divine ratio). A more secular argument would say something similar but drop god from the equation and say it has something to do with fundamental forces that govern the physical world.   Regardless of the explanation, it seems generally accepted that this ratio is related not just to physical phenomenon but also to our perception of physical beauty. As such it is often utilized in art, especially after the the renaissance, with lots old old famous paintings incorporating the golden ratio. even contemporary marketing firms attempt to utilize it in brand logos, believing it a sort of shortcut to creating an aesthetically pleasing image (the new pepsi logo is an example of this approach in marketing)  Hope that helps!",

Your risk is based on how likely you are to actually cross paths with someone infectious and how likely that is to cause you serious harm. So are you in an at risk group and where are you are considerations.   The second - how likely you are to be part of a chain of infection, how at risk are the people around you and how well society - such as the health service is coping.   Masks not perfect and life always holds a risk. In the West we have never masked up for flu which kills thousands of people a year - around 20,000 in the U.K. annually I think - though we vaccinate the at risk. Possibly COVId may have some nasty long term consequences even if you dint get seriously ill. But if the consequences of COVID dropped to equivalent to flu , then it would hardly be unreasonable to behave in a similar way. I say that nit to suggest we wait till then ( if it ever happened) but as a comparative starting point.

Why do they want you to look at a screen? You may ask.  Advertising.  Companies want to make money, and in order to do this they need to let people know about their products. But advertising your products costs a lot of money when you are trying to reach a wider audience.  So they target specific demographics.  Where before, they would've advertised on a certain website, or in a certain area, advertisers can now target specific people. People they know like the kind of things they are selling. People of a particular age and gender who like to purchase products similar to yours.  By targeting more specifically, they have more chance of making a sale per dollar spent on advertising. So companies who harvest data from us sell it to 3rd party advertisers.

This happens twice in meiosis. Either after the first or second round, an egg with 1 set of chromosomes will fuse with another to generate a diploid (2 set) viable egg cell.

The short answer to why they claim they can test hundreds of different reactions is they use IgG tests (*not* IgE tests, which are commonly used by allergists), which looks at the relative amounts of IgG antibodies for the foods they test. The theory is if you have a high number of antibodies, you may be sensitive to that food.   They test for the antibodies by exposing the blood to samples of the food, then check and see how many antibodies attached to each food tested.   If I understand correctly, unlike some other blood tests this means you are only using up blood that reacts to the food samples (presumably with some waste), since they will not attach to food they do not react to, and as such you don't have to \"use up\" as much blood",

You will only get those where there is another molecule they can react with that produces a lower energy situation with a positive ion balanced with a negative one (or more).  So fill a container with ammonia gas and that's wheat it will remain. Introduce an equal number of water molecules and the water loses a proton to the ammonia forming hydroxide and an ammonium ions of equal and opposite charge. An equilibrium will be set up between molecular and ionic forms. NH3 + H2O <=> NH4^+ + OH^-  Similarly SO3 + H2O => 2H+ + SO4^2- although the affinity of sulfur trioxide for water is such that the reverse reaction won't happen because it takes too much energy. You will get the same sort of reactions with other molecules capable of giving up a proton to ammonia (e.g. HCl) or forming salts with acids.  Sulfur dioxide is just one of many oxides of sulfur, but is the lowest energy one when for instance you burn sulfur. You can make the trioxide on the way to manufacturing sulfuric acid but it takes heat energy and a catalyst to oxidize the dioxide. Other oxides known to exist are S2O, SO, and various others because you can replace an oxygen with a sulfur in ion structures like sulfate. So an S surrounded by three oxygens and a sulfur instead of four oxygen atoms gives the thiosulfate ion used in photography as a fixer.

So in your case, your app will ask their servers for the public key of your friend.  Then use that public key to encrypt your text message.  Your friend's app will use it's private key to decrypt the message.  The private keys shouldn't be stored on the server for maximum security.",

    "question": "ELI5: what do Galois groups actually prove about solvability?",
    "answer": "It is a bit complicated but let me try. First, there's two notions called \"solvability,\" one for polynomials and one for groups (I'll explain what groups are later). They'll turn out to be very intimately related, although it may not look like it from the get go. First let me explain the polynomial side of things, it might be a bit easier to grasp.  Ok, so start with a field (we usually take Q, so if you're not sure what the general definition of a field is, just picture rational numbers). You can ask yourself \"what's the smallest set containing Q and some real number that isn't in Q which has a coherent addition and multiplication such that all the \"nice\" properties hold (distributivity, commutativity, associativity, additive and multiplicative inverses)? For example, what's the smallest \"nice\" set (field) containing Q and sqrt(2)? Well, it turns out the best you can do is take all of Q and add all rational multiples of sqrt(2), so you end up with a set consisting of all rational numbers, all rational multiples of sqrt(2), and all possible sums of those. So, \u00bd is an element. So is 3/4xsqrt(2), and so is 4/435435+ 32/9sqrt(2). More generally, any element can be written as a+bsqrt(2), for a and b rational numbers. That set is written Q\\[sqrt(2)\\] (Q adjoin root 2).   Now, I may want to solve a polynomial like x\\^2 -2. The roots as you know are sqrt 2 and - sqrt 2, so they aren't rational. The smallest extension of the rational numbers in which I can find every single root is (in this case) Q\\[sqrt(2)\\]. That means that if I wanted to write that polynomial in factored form, the smallest place I could do it is in Q\\[sqrt(2)\\]. We say that this polynomial is \"solvable\" because I can write it in factored form in some extension of Q which I get to by adding roots. (There's nothing special about only adjoining root 2. I could adjoin any nth root of any rational number, and I could do that as many times as I want. So, something like Q\\[sqrt(2), cube root(1252), sqrt(34564)\\] is also a radical extension, and a polynomial which splits into linear factors in that extension would also be solvable).   Now let's turn to group theory. A group is just a set of symmetries of something -- it's all the ways you can reorder a thing and preserve it in some way. For example, the set of reorderings of the numbers (1,2) is a group containing the elements \"do nothing\" and \"switch 1 and 2.\" Certain groups have a property called \"solvability\" which is technical and seemingly unmotivated. Let's treat it as a black box.   Now, Galois theory relates extensions like Q\\[sqrt 2\\] to groups in a very precise way. For each extension, you can find a unique polynomial which factors linearly over that extension \\*and\\* when you combine all the factors, you get a polynomial with coefficients in Q \\*and\\* is as small (low degree) as possible. In the Q\\[sqrt 2\\] example, that polynomial is x\\^2-2 and it's called the minimal polynomial. The Galois group of the extension is the group which swaps all the roots of the minimal polynomial between each other (in a coherent way). For Q\\[sqrt 2\\], the Galois group is the group which can do 2 things: nothing, or swap sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2), and leave everything else the same. What that means is that the group \"acts\" on the extension. Say I take the group element g which swaps the roots. Then I can apply that element to a random element a + b sqrt(2) of Q\\[sqrt 2\\]. Then g(a+bsqrt(2)) = a-b sqrt(2), because I switch the roots and leave everything else the same.   If that group has the \"solvable\" property, then that polynomial is \"solvable\". Ie, I can write all of its roots in some extension of Q that I get to only by adding some nth roots. The same thing works in reverse: If I can solve a polynomial only by adding nth roots, then the galois group of that extension is solvable. If one of those conditions fails, then the other one must fail as well.   What Galois showed is that every possible group associated to a field where the degree of the minimal polynomial is less than 5 is solvable, but that some groups bigger than that are not solvable. So that implies that every polynomial of degree < 5 is such that every solution is a radical expression, but not every polynomial of degree >= 5 satisfies that.",

    "question": "ELI5: If the body raises its temperature to kill bacteria, why is it bad to take a hot shower when you have a fever?",
    "answer": "It\u2019s not bad to take a hot shower during a fever, it\u2019s just uncomfortable. At the same time, taking a cold shower is not recommended because as your skin (periphery) cools down due to cold water, the body tries to compensate by increasing your core (inside) temperature which we don\u2019t want in a patient already suffering from fever. Hence lukewarm water is the best for this situation.  Now there are chemical compounds called pyrogens (molecules that cause fever). Usually the process goes like this : bacteria/virus/microorganisms enter our body, body/immune system detects certain proteins and chemical structures on them (like the cell wall,etc), sends a signal to the brain, brain is like oops need to kill that, need more ammo, so they release some other substances/chemical compounds which further activates the immune system.  Now both the microorganisms and the brain/immune system\u2019s compounds are what we call pyrogens.  So exogenous ( from outside) pyrogens like bacteria give rise to endogenous (from inside the body) pyrogens like the immune system cells which increases the body temperature level just the way you adjust the thermostat to a higher setting.  Hope this helps. Feel free to ask any questions :)  Edit : Thanks for all the upvotes and awards, science is great, I love it  Edit : adding this signalling pathway for people who are interested  so bacteria inside the body \u2014 bacterial cell wall has certain proteins on it \u2014\u2014 immune cells (mainly macrophages, first line of defence) detect those proteins \u2014\u2014 immune cells go to the protein (hence the bacteria) binds to it \u2014\u2014 this binding results in a release of bunch of other chemicals (interleukins) \u2014- release of these chemicals activates an enzyme (enzymes are proteins that make chemical reactions happen/happen faster) \u2014- this enzyme releases something called PGE2 ( a prostaglandin) \u2014\u2014- this PGE2 acts like a hormone \u2014- go to the nerve cells in hypothalamus part of the brain\u2014\u2014 hypothalamus detects this PGE2 and understands that temp of the body must be raised \u2014- so it tells the muscles to produce more heat, diverts blood from periphery to the core and breaks down some fat cells as they produce heat  Edit : omg this blew up, I love being able to share all this with you guys, sorry for late replies, I was at work",

    "answer": "The GPU is the Graphics Processor (or Processing) Unit. It's a fancy (pricy) way to name what we used to call the Display Adapter, where you plug in your monitor. Presumably it has a processor in it and lots of memory, so arguably it's a whole computer, totally devoted to making the images you see on the screen.  It's very possible that the processor in the GPU is faster and has more memory than the CPU (Central Processor Unit) of the computer itself, as well as having more memory available to it. This is for high end graphics, including high resolution, 3D motion, game graphics. etc..  Back in the day, the Display Adapter simply sent out to the screen whatever was in the display memory area of the computer. It was put there by the CPU. In fact one inexpensive computer (Timex) used the back-scan part of the image generation to run actual computation. So you could speed up your program by selectively turning off the display. That's sort of the exact opposite of having a GPU. lol  Also, some folks use this power of the GPU to do other computation when it's not in use. For example, Bitcoin mining or BOINC computation. In some cases, criminal sites will take over your GPU for their own purposes, without your consent.",

    "answer": "First of all, \u201cmedically induced coma\u201d isn\u2019t a medical term. What it actually refers to is a combination of pain medicine and sedation medicine that are used to keep people calm and comfortable while they have a breathing tube in.   Second, this \u201ccoma\u201d or state of sedation isn\u2019t done to treat the overdose itself. It is done again to allow for uncomfortable medical interventions such as a breathing tube and possibly cooling (targeted temperature management).  When he overdosed, his breathing became so slow and shallow and he did not get enough oxygen and he could not blow out carbon dioxide. When the heart doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen it will stop beating. When the brain doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen for long enough, it causes brain damage (anoxic brain injury).   CPR is used to circulate blood as we try to restart the heart with medication and/or shocks.  A breathing tube is placed to breath for the patient until they can breath on their own.  When a patient has cardiac/respiratory arrest, they almost always have some amount of brain damage, unless high quality CPR was started immediately. We keep them on ventilators (breathing machine connected to the breathing tube that goes down his throat) because the brain damage means he likely wont be able to breath on his own for a while. In many cases after cardiac arrest we also \u201ccool\u201d the patient. This means bringing down their body temperature low enough that it slows metabolism by brain cells and can possibly reduce long term brain damage.  In the next couple days, they will try turning down the sedation to see if he wakes up and evaluate how his brain is functioning (called a sedation vacation). If he does wake up, they will also try a spontaneous breathing trial- turning the ventilator off briefly to see if he is able to breath on his own. If he passes both of those they may be able to take the breathing tube out, and if not they will keep it and try again the next day.",

These polar molecules then all have intermolecular attractive forces between them, which allows whatever your dissolving to get pulled into and spread out through the water.  MnO2 doesn\u2019t have these properties, and acts the same something like Rust, Fe02 would, it doesn\u2019t do much.

The only role cost plays is that if your suspected price is lower than your cost, you don't enter the market at all (because you think you'll lose money).

    "answer": "> And then you can modulate the wave so it carries data. For digital modulation, that means you vary the amplitude or power level of the transmission.  And/or you can vary the frequency or phase. In FM transmission, you would change your 2400MHz signal up or down by up to 10MHz, and your 'bandwidth' would be just that - your band width, the difference between the lowest and highest frequency you're sending.  Other modulation schemes which use phase and amplitude together are in use too. One example is [QAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation).  If you're transmitting a digital AM signal by pulsing a single carrier frequency on and off, then your bandwidth is the result of a tradeoff based on how fast you're pulsing on and off relative to the frequency of the carrier wave. If you're pulsing a carrier wave on and off very fast, approaching the frequency of the carrier itself, then the spectrum of what you're sending gets quite wide. If you transmit a pure 2400MHz signal at constant level forever, never stopping or starting, then that would be a 0 bandwidth signal, a pure frequency. But when the signal is stopping and starting, the band gets wider than 0. This is just a mathematical consequence of how frequencies work.

    "question": "ELI5: what do Galois groups actually prove about solvability?",
    "answer": "It is a bit complicated but let me try. First, there's two notions called \"solvability,\" one for polynomials and one for groups (I'll explain what groups are later). They'll turn out to be very intimately related, although it may not look like it from the get go. First let me explain the polynomial side of things, it might be a bit easier to grasp.  Ok, so start with a field (we usually take Q, so if you're not sure what the general definition of a field is, just picture rational numbers). You can ask yourself \"what's the smallest set containing Q and some real number that isn't in Q which has a coherent addition and multiplication such that all the \"nice\" properties hold (distributivity, commutativity, associativity, additive and multiplicative inverses)? For example, what's the smallest \"nice\" set (field) containing Q and sqrt(2)? Well, it turns out the best you can do is take all of Q and add all rational multiples of sqrt(2), so you end up with a set consisting of all rational numbers, all rational multiples of sqrt(2), and all possible sums of those. So, \u00bd is an element. So is 3/4xsqrt(2), and so is 4/435435+ 32/9sqrt(2). More generally, any element can be written as a+bsqrt(2), for a and b rational numbers. That set is written Q\\[sqrt(2)\\] (Q adjoin root 2).   Now, I may want to solve a polynomial like x\\^2 -2. The roots as you know are sqrt 2 and - sqrt 2, so they aren't rational. The smallest extension of the rational numbers in which I can find every single root is (in this case) Q\\[sqrt(2)\\]. That means that if I wanted to write that polynomial in factored form, the smallest place I could do it is in Q\\[sqrt(2)\\]. We say that this polynomial is \"solvable\" because I can write it in factored form in some extension of Q which I get to by adding roots. (There's nothing special about only adjoining root 2. I could adjoin any nth root of any rational number, and I could do that as many times as I want. So, something like Q\\[sqrt(2), cube root(1252), sqrt(34564)\\] is also a radical extension, and a polynomial which splits into linear factors in that extension would also be solvable).   Now let's turn to group theory. A group is just a set of symmetries of something -- it's all the ways you can reorder a thing and preserve it in some way. For example, the set of reorderings of the numbers (1,2) is a group containing the elements \"do nothing\" and \"switch 1 and 2.\" Certain groups have a property called \"solvability\" which is technical and seemingly unmotivated. Let's treat it as a black box.   Now, Galois theory relates extensions like Q\\[sqrt 2\\] to groups in a very precise way. For each extension, you can find a unique polynomial which factors linearly over that extension \\*and\\* when you combine all the factors, you get a polynomial with coefficients in Q \\*and\\* is as small (low degree) as possible. In the Q\\[sqrt 2\\] example, that polynomial is x\\^2-2 and it's called the minimal polynomial. The Galois group of the extension is the group which swaps all the roots of the minimal polynomial between each other (in a coherent way). For Q\\[sqrt 2\\], the Galois group is the group which can do 2 things: nothing, or swap sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2), and leave everything else the same. What that means is that the group \"acts\" on the extension. Say I take the group element g which swaps the roots. Then I can apply that element to a random element a + b sqrt(2) of Q\\[sqrt 2\\]. Then g(a+bsqrt(2)) = a-b sqrt(2), because I switch the roots and leave everything else the same.   If that group has the \"solvable\" property, then that polynomial is \"solvable\". Ie, I can write all of its roots in some extension of Q that I get to only by adding some nth roots. The same thing works in reverse: If I can solve a polynomial only by adding nth roots, then the galois group of that extension is solvable. If one of those conditions fails, then the other one must fail as well.   What Galois showed is that every possible group associated to a field where the degree of the minimal polynomial is less than 5 is solvable, but that some groups bigger than that are not solvable. So that implies that every polynomial of degree < 5 is such that every solution is a radical expression, but not every polynomial of degree >= 5 satisfies that.",

    "answer": "A naked short is an illegal practice in which an institution borrows a share of a stock and shorts it, except the share has not been determined to exist.   For example, say there are 1 million shares of a company. A normal short would be borrowing 100 shares and paying a premium to open a contract giving you the right to sell those shares at a price (the strike price) regardless of what the price is. This means if the stock goes down you can sell it for more than its worth. A naked short, is borrowing shares that aren\u2019t determined to exist. This means if there are 1 million shares, and someone\u2019s buys short contracts worth more shares than what exist in the market, it\u2019s artificial.   This is illegal because it creates an artificial market with non existent shares and mostly undermines the whole system. However this is a common practice by many financial institutions such as hedge funds (citadel for example).   As for what happened on CNBC, an anchor woman actually called what the current hedge funds and market participants naked shorting, in reference to AMC and GameStop stock. This is significant because naked shorting is illegal. So a trusted financial news source like CNBC on air saying it\u2019s naked shorting is validating the reason why many people are buying and holding shares of company\u2019s like AMC and GameStop.

When I'm reading, my eyes are scanning the words, I know the words make their way into my brain but since I'm usually day dreaming at the same time, the words from the book don't get processed.

    "question": "ELI5: Why are v8 engines over 5 liters in size common but i4 engines over 2.5 liters are very uncommon?",
    "answer": "I4 engines have excellent Primary Balance characteristics, meaning vibration due to the up-down motion of the pistons cancels each other out. It's easy to see why this works in animations of such engines.  However i4 engines have unusually poor *Second-Order Balance.*   Second-Order balance, also called secondary balance is related to the inevitable side-to-side rocking motion of the connecting rods. This motion causes the center of mass of the connecting rod to not move perfectly in sync with the CM of the piston. Rather, the connecting rod CM moves closer to the top surface of piston by a few mm, at the middle of the stroke then back again at bottom and top dead center. The term \"Second Order\" refers to the fact that this vibration occurs two times per revolution of the crankshaft.   What's worse, in an i4 these vibrations are perfectly in phase with each other with all 4 cylinders.  The fewest number of cylinders you can have and still have good secondary balance is 6.  I6 engines are inherently very well balanced. This is why many large heavily turbocharged diesel engines use this configuration.   At higher engine speed second-order forces grow in relation to the *square* of the crankshaft RPM, rather than in a linear fashion. This means that if you double the RPM the secondary vibration grows by 4x, and if you triple the RPM the vibration grows by 9x. So it's easy to see that this could lead to catastrophic engine failure to the tune of throwing a connecting rod in an i4.  To counteract this ~~almost all~~ (EDIT: *the majority of*) i4 engines have balancing shafts with counterweights that rotate at twice the engine RPM to prevent the engine from shaking itself off the engine mounts above, say, 2500RPM. Indeed most engines with less than 6 cylinders have balancing shafts of some type. This is far from a perfect solution with i4's since this still produces additional forces on the engine block between the crankshaft and balancer bearings that are less than desirable. The balancer shafts consume power themselves and result in higher vibration at idle speed. Their inertia reduces engine revving.   This brings us to the other prescription for the secondary balance problem, which is to reduce the engine redline. It's hard to get around this second part.   So, above 2.8L or so, you end up with a  Law-of -Diminishing-Returns relationship where larger and larger cylinders necessitate heavier connecting rods that cause greater and greater secondary vibration. This means you need to reduce the engine operating speed while using an increasingly heavy balancing shaft that consumes more power, causes more idle vibration, and induces more forces into the engine block between it's own bearings and the crankshaft main bearing. Thus, necessitating a thicker, heavier crankshaft and engine block. Beyond a certain point the fact that you're invariably forced to reduce the redline and increase engine weight in a way that's disproportionate to the displacement, wipes out any additional power you'd gain by increasing the cylinder size. Say, above about 3.5L  A V-8 deals with the secondary balance problem by operating each bank 90\u00b0 out of phase to each other, so that second-order forces in each bank tend to cancel each other instead of adding together constructively. However V-8s often use balancer shafts to counteract high RPM vibrations. The same can be much smaller on V-8 with respect to displacement, a V-8 with 6L does not need a balance shaft twice as large as an i4 with 3L. In fact a smaller one can be used in the former V8.  In V-6 engines there is good second order balance, but you have a moderate issue with primary balance.  A three cylinder engine does not have the outstanding primary balance of an i4, but it is better than a single cylinder. Specifically, in an i3 the uo and down monitions of the pistons to not always perfectly counteract each other. In a V6, unbalanced primary forces can be made to counteract each other best using a 60\u00b0 angle, but this does not entirely eliminate them. So V-6s have primary balance that is not quite a good as V-8's and they vibrate more. Again the usual solution is to reduce the redline RPM. Balancer shafts are also common on v6's  Another solution to the secondary balance problem is the one used by Karl Frederich Benz. He and his company produced the first flat-four opposed piston engine in 1900, using a boxer configuration that should ne familiar to fans of subaru, Porche, or VW cars.   These engines were used in Benz's racing cars, they had 5.4 liters and produced 20 HP, which was excellent at the time. The engines did not need balancer shafts at all and operated much more smoothly than the engines of Benz's competitors.  So why aren't flat-four boxer engines used on most cars? Well because they're significantly more difficult to produce and precision-assemble, and create a number of other less than obvious technical problems.",

    "answer": "Well, your brain just goes all the time. It feels like \"you\" are sort of a pilot in a semi-automated biological suit, and \"you\" live in your head and think thoughts all day. But there is no actual \"thinker of thoughts\" in your brain. \"You\" are just the experience of being conscious and part of that is feeling like you're coming up with thoughts. It's important to be aware that you don't author your thoughts. Ever. They just pop into your awareness. In fact, there is no \"you\" in the way that people usually think about it. We've evolved to fool ourselves in this way; maybe for some survival reason, or maybe just as a side effect of intelligence or something. Nobody knows for sure.  But, with lots and lots of practice, some people can pay attention to just the experience of being conscious, and eventually could be said to 'not think anything' when they want to. This takes a lot of practice and can be difficult. I'm skeptical that 100% of people are capable of it (though I can't be sure, it may just be easier for some than others).  So it's not exactly impossible, but like many skills, takes many many thousands of hours of practice and doesn't come naturally to most to \"not think anything\".",

Non-profits raise funds through donations (monetary donations, sponsorships of events, buying tickets to attend a gala, donation of goods, etc), fees (museum admission, university tuition, hospital bills), merchandise sales (gift shop sales, t-shirt sales at charity event) and such.  Those revenues pay for administrative costs to run the events and do other fundraising activities, as well as fund the cause.

Most often, that damage means the cell won't be able to survive and perform its function and the cell dies (or is killed by the immune system) without causing any harm.  Sometimes, the DNA damage causes the cell to survive, grow, and reproduce uncontrollably, potentially spreading to other areas of the body.  At this point, the cells are considered cancerous and can grow and multiply to form tumors, ignore signals to stop growing, redirect bloodflow from the body to keep themselves growing, 'hide' from the immune system by appearing to be healthy, and potentially move into new areas of the body.  The damage to the DNA can come from any number of sources, from a simple mistake in making a copy to direct damage from UV radiation to carcinogenic chemicals that enter the cell and cause damage.",

Outside very specialized and explicit contracts, called \"cost plus\" and almost exclusively used in government/military contracts, the price has nothing to do with the cost.  Products get their final price by the seller guessing what they can charge that will maximize profit (like /u/ViolettPapillon describes). This is entirely based on the buyers' willingness to pay, NOT what the product cost to produce.   The only role cost plays is that if your suspected price is lower than your cost, you don't enter the market at all (because you think you'll lose money). As long as you reasonably believe you can charge more than it costs, you will price it as high as you think the buyer will pay.

    "answer": "One important consideration is the constant body position. Sitting around the house when you're relaxing, you'll be shifting positions periodically, leaning forward, leaning back, bearing more weight on your hipbones or your thighs, lifting or crossing or uncrossing your legs, etc.  A long car or plane ride doesn't give you nearly as much freedom to do that. The sitting position is pretty rigid, and you might be able to lean the seat further back or more upright, but that's typically about all the freedom you get. Add to this the fact that you're actively balancing even as you sit, if there is any wobbling, bumpiness or G-forces on the ride. You can't fully relax in a car because muscles in your back and abdomen are constantly responding to the little lateral forces produced by handling the car. Depending on the size of the plane and the air conditions, the same might be true on a flight.  Finally, the sensory input can be mentally exhausting. Highway driving is noisy, and can expose you to pretty fast-moving visual scenery which, even if you're not really paying attention to it, your brain might be noticing and spending some energy on. Planes in flight are also very loud places to be. That can wear you down and push you toward mental fatigue.",

Aka, your heart will be better at circulating blood if it's in good shape, thus allowing more blood to get to \"injured\" places in the body, thus healing them faster.  Also, increased exercise causes decreased fat in the body. Fat clogs arteries making blood flow slower. Your body also has to work harder in general to support the extra weight. So, decrease your fat and you'll increase your performance in all areas.  Here's an example. Let's say your liver is damaged. It needs 100 blood cells per hour to heal. Your heart is only able to deliver 75 per hour because it's weak. On top of that you have fat, restricting blood flow, so that 75 cells goes down to 50.

Subscriptions are a way to make people think they are spending less than they are, and for them to never even know how much they are spending. It exploits ego and ignorance and often emotions.  The super simple answer is because they know they can get more money for the same thing because people look at a monthly price as the total cost even if they understand it isn't.

It measures the effectiveness of content in terms of watch time - how much time the userbase as a whole spends watching a show.

    "answer": "You are kind of right, saying it is cold in space is not saying much about the experience of being in space since there is nothing to carry or hold onto any temperature. However you do not need anything to transfer thermal energy. Although not as efficient hot things will emit thermal radiation which will heat up objects around it. This is how the heat from the sun is transferred through empty space to Earth and how the heat from a fire can warm you even though the air goes up into the air. And we can measure how much energy comes from each direction and therefore get a temperature of everything. And it turns out the universe is pretty cold. But it will take a long time for someone to cool down to this temperature. Especially if they happen to be around Earth and get hit by the heat emitted from the Earth as well as the hot rays from the Sun.",

    "question": "ELI5 how does the IRS \"wash rule\" work?",
    "answer": "Put simply, the wash sale rule prohibits an investor from claiming a capital loss for tax purposes if they repurchase the stock or security within 30 days.1  Specifically, the IRS deems a transaction a wash sale if the investor does the following 30 days before or after a sale:  1. Purchases the same investment 2. Purchases a substantially similar investment 3. Enters into a contract to buy a similar investment 4. Acquires a similar stock for an IRA or Roth IRA  An Example  Imagine an investor unfortunate enough to purchase Lucent Technology stock when it was trading upwards of $70 per share. Over subsequent years before the firm disappeared through mergers and acquisitions, that investor watched accounting scandals, financial trouble, and sales meltdowns wipe the share price down to $1.3  Ever the enterprising baron, our investor realizes that if they sell their shares, they can report a capital loss and lower their tax burden. The problem? They believe that Lucent, or the firm that ultimately owns it, will rise from the ashes and return some of the market value which it has lost.  Suddenly, our investor gets a brilliant idea. During the last week of December, they call their broker with instructions to sell their shares in the telecom equipment supplier, locking in the capital loss. Three weeks later, during the first half of January, they ask their broker to repurchase those shares of Lucent. All is well in the world; they locked in the capital loss while holding onto the shares. Seems ingenious, right?  The wash sale rule, as you remember, does not allow an investor to claim a capital loss if they repurchase the investment within 30 days. In other words, unless the investor waits until the 30-day period has elapsed, they will not be able to write the off the loss.  There are ways around this, but let us assume the guy in the article didn't do that.  He sells his shares down at $1 in December, buys them back in the next year at nearly the same price, and the stock goes back up.  His 2019 taxes say he lost $5,000,000 and he got an $800,000 tax break, but in 2020, they went up to a total of $5,045,000 ($45,000 profit), but he gets penalized for the wash sale, and has to pay back the $800,000",

The most precise measurements are based on the [Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background).  There is a convenient reference frame called the [comoving frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoving_coordinates#Comoving_coordinates), in which the CMB light coming from all directions is equally redshifted.  This is also the reference frame in which the universe is the oldest, and is the reference frame we use when doing most cosmology.  Our solar system is moving at about 371 km/s relative to the comoving frame, which gives a time dilation factor of only 1.0000008, which is why it doesn't matter much what (reasonable) reference frame we pick.

    "answer": "A musical scale is a series of notes that repeat after an octave. Scales in western music usually have 7 notes, with the eighth being an octave of the first note. An octave is just two notes that sound the same, but one sounds \"higher\" than the other.  In western music, there are 12 notes that repeat: A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, then it starts repeating with A again. [Here's a picture to show how the notes are arranged on part of a piano keyboard](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3c/83/a7/3c83a794158355fe0e58232d9ce56e34.jpg). The # and \u266d note names (the names of the black keys) are interchangeable.  When you play a scale, you aren't playing all the notes. To simplify a lot, some notes just *sound better* when you group them together. If you were to just play all the notes, it might sound like chaos.  For instance, the most common scale in western music is the major scale. You can pick any note and play a major scale starting with that note. If you pick the major scale starting on C, the notes will be C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. If you pick the G major scale, the notes will be G, A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. To figure it out yourself, use this pattern: you can pick a note (call it the *root note* of the scale), then move up the keyboard (to the right) by this set of steps: skip a note, skip a note, don't skip a note, skip a note, skip a note, skip a note, don't skip a note. And that's a major scale.  If you were to \"play in a scale\", you can play any of the notes in that scale in whatever order you want, and they'll \"sound good\" with anyone else playing in that scale.  There are a lot of different kind of scales, and using them in different ways, in combination with each other, helps us to make interesting songs, based on the basic concept of tension and release.",

The reason why others don't do it is energy, and money. \"What you are missing here\" is the sheer amount of water needed and how much that would cost. Let's break it down.  **California consumes 38 billion (**[**38,000,000,000) gallons of water per day**](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2014/08/21/usgs-estimates-vast-amounts-water-used-california/14400333/)**.**  Producing desalinated water has a big cost range depending on the type of plant and how big it is, but it's something like [$2 per 325 gallons.](https://www.wired.com/story/desalination-is-booming-as-cities-run-out-of-water/) Therefore, making enough fresh water for California is going to cost **$233 million** ***per day***\\*.\\*  Oh and you have to build the desalination plants first! A desalination plant that can produce [100 million gallons per day costs $658 million](https://www.twdb.texas.gov/innovativewater/desal/faq.asp). So for California's 38 billion gallons per day, you need to build 380 such mega-plants, which would cost **$250 billion total**. Plus the $233M per day to operate the plants.  Oh and then you have to transport all the fresh water from those 380 plants along the coast to where it's needed. Water is very heavy, so shipping is tough. You either need to move 38 billion gallons a day in train tankers + trucks, or construct thousands of miles of huge-diameter pipelines across the whole state.

    "question": "ELI5: What does it mean to be \u201cmassless\u201d?",
    "answer": "Oh boy, all aboard the brain hurt train, next stop - Quantum mechanics!  Mass is a property that particles can have, its a way for energy to be stored but not the only way and not all particles have mass.  Most things you deal with are large and are made up of massive quantities of particles which all have mass so most stuff you think of has mass, but the light from the sun doesn't have mass but it can still push things because a photon's energy is in its momentum (not mass*velocity but a more intrinsic momentum).  You'll often see E=mc^2 (energy = mass * speed of light^2) but the full equation is E^2 = p^(2)c^(2)+m^(2)c^(4) where p is momentum.  Photons have momentum but not rest mass which forces them to travel at the speed of light, nothing with mass can reach the speed of light without infinite energy and nothing without mass can travel at any other speed.  Basically the universe has a set of fields that things interact with.  The electromagnetic field interacts with charge and magnetism, its force is carried by photons.  The Higgs field is what gives things mass, its force is carried by the Higgs boson.  Photons happen to not interact with the Higgs field and therefore don't have mass, while quarks and electrons and neutrinos all do interact with the Higgs field and therefore have mass.  Why don't photons interact with the Higgs field?  Just the way the rules happened to be set up.",

    "answer": "I want to point out that there are cases when stock price does not go to zero. But if it is actual Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, the shares cease to exist after everything is said and done, as there is no more company afterwards.  One good example of this was Hertz. It was believed last year that Hertz was going to go into Chapter 7 bankruptcy. However, Hertz had more assets than it did debt, if everything went perfect for Hertz then they would have had 2 dollars per share left after all was said and done, and this would have been distributed to shareholders.  When people realized this, Hertz's stock spiked from the 50 cents it was worth, because after all it was believed that if you bought a share for say 1 dollar and after liquidation you would have gotten 2 dollars from the remaining assets, it would have been profitable even if the share ceased to exist afterwards.  In the vast majority of cases, Ch 7 bankruptcy happens when a company has more debt than assets though. In that case, creditors get first dibs on any asset proceeds and shareholders get last dibs, which means they get nothing usually, and stock goes to 0 since no one is willing to buy worthless shares.",

    "question": "ELI5: How does light have momentum if photons have no mass? Momentum is mass times the acceleration (p=mv), so something with no mass should have zero momentum.",
    "answer": "Good question! Let's think of momentum as the idea a moving object has energy it can transfer to another moving object through a collision. For things with mass, one object speeds up and the other slows down after a collision (or their velocities change, to be more accurate).  With light, we see that light can hit an object with mass, change its velocity, and the deflected light will be red-shifted (indicating it lost energy). If we look at the system as a whole, the change in the momentum of the deflected object will match the energy lost by the photon. By our momentum definition, that means the photon had momentum and then transferred it to the object!  More generally, we can describe momentum due to an objects mass (p = mv) and momentum (energy) due to its wave-character (p = h/lambda or hf/c [since lambda = c/f]). All matter has wave character (as described by its de Broglie wavelength), but for massive objects, the wavelength tends to be so large it's unobservable and the contribution to momentum basically rounds to zero (especially next to the large momentum of an object with mass).   Usually we worry about this \"dual character\" with electrons, which have both mass and wave-like characteristics and we need this relativistic explanation of momentum to better understand their behavior.  This idea that light has momentum is how solar sails work. Even if individual photons have very, very small momentum compared to a massive object, the sun makes a lot of them and overtime it can push around small objects like probes!",

    "answer": "There are different types, but one uses sodium acetate dissolved in water. It's a super-saturated solution, meaning that really there is more stuff dissolved in the water than the water would \"like\". So the sodium acetates \"wants\" to start come out of solution and form solid crystals. To start growing a crystal, though, you need a *nucleation site*, some little bit of something that the first sodium acetate molecules can latch onto and then gather into a crystal from there. Without a nucleation site, the sodium acetate stays in its super-saturated solution.  The hand warmer packet contains this solution along with a little strip of metal. If you bend this strip, little bits of metal come off and these provide nucleation sites for the crystals to start growing. This crystallization process is an *exothermic*, i.e. heat-releasing, reaction.  How did the heat get there? Well, to create a super-saturated solution, you need to dissolve the sodium acetate in hot water (which can hold more stuff in solution) and then let it cool. Some of the heat you put in gets stored in the solution - the heat that was necessary to get it super-saturated (in other words, the solution reaction was *endothermic*). When the excess sodium acetate crystallizes, the heat energy stored in the solution is released.  As to why it is safe, you can calculate how much heat energy will be released and thus how  hot the hand warmer will get. So you can ensure that the temperature will be in a safe range. There's no danger of a \"runaway\" reaction since you know exactly how much sodium acetate you dissolved and how much solution you put in the packet.",

Launching a big expensive space station just to simulate Earth conditions would be counter productive in this setting.  There have however been a few suggestions for how to create artificial gravity by spinning up parts or the entire space station and create centrifugal forces that simulate gravity. There are however issues such as possible oscillations, how to dock with such a space station, how to interface rotating and stationary components, etc.  In fact there was a big centrifuge module constructed for the ISS. The purpose was to be able to simulate Lunar or Mars gravity for research programs, test out designs for centrifugal space stations, conduct control experiments in space, and so on. But due to issues with balancing such a huge rotating mass inside a fragile space station it was limited in size and was not big enough for humans, only rodents and plants. Sadly due to issues with funding and delays in the construction of ISS this module was parked in a parking lot in Japan and have not moved in over twenty years.  There is currently some suggestions for one of research missions with the new cheaper spacecraft that have come on the market the last decade. The plans usually involves tying a long tether between the spacecraft and the upper stage booster that put it in orbit. This configuration could then be spun up using the thrusters and therefore generating a nice stable simulated gravity at very low cost.

    "question": "ELI5:What are \"wrapped coins\" (wEth, wBTC, ...) ?",
    "answer": "Back in the 2017 crypto bull run, bitcoin was really expensive to send around because of the network congestion but sending eth around was super cheap. Since eth allows you to do smart contracts, you can make an eth token called \u201cbitcoin\u201d (or \u201cwrapped bitcoin\u201d so it doesn\u2019t confuse people), and essentially lock up an actual bitcoin in a ethereum smart contract and send around that eth token (called eth wrapped bitcoin) instead.   The real bitcoin is still there, gaining or losing value, but you can send around your eth token and pay minimal eth fees instead of sending around that actual bitcoin.  Fast forward to this bull run and people made jokes how it should be bitocin wrapped eth now (since eth fees got pretty ridiculous). This can\u2019t happen quite yet because bitcoin can\u2019t do smart contracts.  It\u2019s basically a bridge between chains. So you can use any coin on any network.  Edit:  I\u2019m going to add to this because I\u2019m obsessed with crypto and want everyone else to be as well.   You may see tokens like cETH, aUSDC, or CAKE-LP (as opposed to the actual assets: ETH, USDC, or CAKE). These are called proof of ownership tokens. You can look at them like receipts.   For example, let\u2019s say I have some USDC (US dollar coin), and I want to get interest on my USDC. To do this, I deposit them into a lending pool (let\u2019s say I use the Aave protocol). Once they leave my wallet, I get aUSDC (Aave USDC) in return. This is an absolutely amazing and overlooked feature of crypto. This aUSDC I have is just as valuable as the asset itself + any interest it\u2019s generating. If I sent you my aUSDC tokens, you can withdraw all my usdc (and any accrued interest) out of Aave. This allows the usdc holder to not only gain interest in the Aave lending pool but now take that \u201creceipt\u201d and use that value somewhere else to generate even more passive income.   Uhhhg I could go on but then I\u2019ll for sure be treading on waters that are too difficult for 5 year olds if I haven\u2019t already >.<  Dm me if you have any questions!

    "answer": "There are 3 ways that heat is transferred.  Two of these, convection and conduction, require a medium to distribute the heat.  The third, radiation, does not. That's how heat can travel from the Sun to the Earth without a medium between the two.   Losing heat through radiation alone is slower than by the other methods, so objects in space cool more slowly, but they do cool eventually.

    "question": "ELI5: If electrical providers share the same power lines, how do they know who is consuming whose power?",
    "answer": "In ERCOT (Texas) everything was \"unbundled\" when the industry was de-regulated (or re-regulated depending on your viewpoint). So generation is independent of transmission and distribution. Energy Service Providers (ESP's) sell energy to the end consumer buy buying energy from the generators through a QSE (Qualified Scheduling Entity) and delivering to the end user on transmission and distribution lines, which may or may not be one company. The distribution company (the \"Wires\" company) is the one that delivers your power to point of use. This is the one you have no choice over, since each has it's own territory.  Energy at every point (generation, transmission, distribution) is metered by extremely accurate meters that have to meet exacting standards. These are the \"settlement\" meters. There are also the meters on your home.  The \"settlement\" meters are  all time stamped at a minimum of every 15 minutes, although I believe generation is actually at 5 minute intervals. All this metering data is routed through ERCOT where generation output is matched against all the various transmission/distribution metering points, and ultimately balanced out against the end metering at your house. This is the only way it can be done, since the grid is entirely interconnected (internally), so generation is about like pumping a water well into a river, then monitoring who pulls water out.  Once all the data has been processed, fund allocations are made based on who bought what from whom at what price and what time. Even though the metering has 15 minutes intervals, the billing is usually done on an hourly basis.  Anyone can play. Grid generation is determined by who can offer \"base\" load at the cheapest price. This is the load that is pretty much there all the time. The \"intermediate\" load (i.e., the day gets warmer and load goes up from base) is the generation that is slightly more expensive. The highest cost generation comes on at peak (late afternoon in a Texas summer). The ESP's (remember them) try to study their load patterns, weather predictions, etc. and arrange through the QSE's to acquire given amounts of power at given times. Since \"anyone can play\" this means that the end user (you) can use a solar or wind turbine to generate back into the grid through your house meter and receive compensation.  ESP's are responsible for their costs. If they don't schedule enough energy, they end up paying a premium price at peak loads (aka, the recent ice storm). On the flip side, if they schedule too much and don't need it, they can either try to sell it on the market, or pay for it even though they didn't need it.  The \"wires\" companies get their money by fixed rates based on their \"cost of service\" and often tie in an extra charge based on kwh usage. They do not market \"energy\" unless they are an Electric Cooperative (which I think is unique to ERCOT). So the \"wires\" companys roll is to provide the actual service and metering.  There are more \"fun and games\" money making schemes like Congestion Revenue Rights if you want to look up an example of capitalism at it's finest (or worst).",

    "answer": "First of all, \u201cmedically induced coma\u201d isn\u2019t a medical term. What it actually refers to is a combination of pain medicine and sedation medicine that are used to keep people calm and comfortable while they have a breathing tube in.   Second, this \u201ccoma\u201d or state of sedation isn\u2019t done to treat the overdose itself. It is done again to allow for uncomfortable medical interventions such as a breathing tube and possibly cooling (targeted temperature management).  When he overdosed, his breathing became so slow and shallow and he did not get enough oxygen and he could not blow out carbon dioxide. When the heart doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen it will stop beating. When the brain doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen for long enough, it causes brain damage (anoxic brain injury).   CPR is used to circulate blood as we try to restart the heart with medication and/or shocks.  A breathing tube is placed to breath for the patient until they can breath on their own.  When a patient has cardiac/respiratory arrest, they almost always have some amount of brain damage, unless high quality CPR was started immediately. We keep them on ventilators (breathing machine connected to the breathing tube that goes down his throat) because the brain damage means he likely wont be able to breath on his own for a while. In many cases after cardiac arrest we also \u201ccool\u201d the patient. This means bringing down their body temperature low enough that it slows metabolism by brain cells and can possibly reduce long term brain damage.  In the next couple days, they will try turning down the sedation to see if he wakes up and evaluate how his brain is functioning (called a sedation vacation). If he does wake up, they will also try a spontaneous breathing trial- turning the ventilator off briefly to see if he is able to breath on his own. If he passes both of those they may be able to take the breathing tube out, and if not they will keep it and try again the next day.",

    "answer": "In fractional reserve banking, a bank is allowed to accept deposits and issue loans. It promises to let depositors withdraw their money when they please, but holds only part of its deposits in reserve in case they actually do. So effectively, by promising people access to more money than it actually holds in cash, a bank can introduce new money into the economy. This increase in liquidity encourages investment and economic growth. The system works so long as not too many people demand their money back at once (a \"run on the bank\").  This is like a Ponzi scheme in that there is a risk your deposit is not covered by cash actually held by the fund, but there's no element of fraud; the bank doesn't lie to you about where the interest it pays comes from or pretend to invest in assets in your name that don't actually exist. And the money it does make comes from real loans.  Governments control the risks of inflation from too much money from bank lending by making laws about how much the bank is required to hold in reserve, and by taking action with a central bank that then influences the lending behavior of other banks. They also create programs to insure deposits up to a certain amount, which eliminates the risk for depositors and thus the need to withdraw their savings if they are unsure about the bank, which also reduces risk for the bank.",

    "question": "ELI5 Is the cut-down hashrate on the new GPUs going to affect performance in usual tasks?",
    "answer": "GPUs now are a bit like \"programmable CPUs\", or ASICs.   Basically, you can program them to do functions in hardware. Some very specific functions are used for mining cryptos, usually one specific algorithm per crypto family ( i say family because nearly every bitcoin derived cryptos use the same algorithm). Mostly, GPUs are used to mine ethereum, because that is the crypto that earns the most. It will also stop being that much profitable in july, with some modifications to the transaction system, and it is supposed to go \"proof of stake\", meaning it cannot be mined anymore, by the end of the year.  &#x200B;  That being said, nvidia's new GPU lock means it will recognise the algorithm used to mine ethereum, and perform lower when found. The algorithm is very unlikely to ever be used for gaming or video editing.  Note: unlike the previous \"soft lock\" , that was a kind of an added identifier chip on the board that the driver would read, then cut performance or not, the new one is supposedly a \"hardware lock\", meaning the locking part is IN the GPU and cannot be bypassed.  &#x200B;  Now, the reason nvidia does that is simply to shift the blame from them to a convenient scapegoat.  Nvidia cannot face the demand for its 30x0 chips, due to originally not making enough, then being struck by the global chip shortage, and that is not going to be better soon.  Just like every product in huge demand and low supply, it gets scalped to oblivion. AMD's card suffer from the same, although their architecture prevents them from being used for mining.  But popular opinion claims this is caused - and keeps going on- because miners buy them all.   Now, miners usually do it for the money, which means they are predictable. upon a very simple return on investment computation, and a risk vs reward analysis. And, most of all, they use the cards, they do not sell them. Meaning if you can get cards, even at scalping price, it means miners do not get them.  The question is then \"are cards available at scalper prices ?\" and since the answer is \"yes\", it means miners are not a concern. They may have been by the end of last year/start of this one, but it became very risky financially wise to start eth mining past february/march. It did hit an all time high not that long ago... and lost more than 70% of its value in a couple of days, last week.  In the end what most people do now when they buy a 3070 or 3080 is to use them to play / work, and mine when they do not, because it went from highly technical to as simple as making some double clicks. Just ... dont expect making much doing that.  anyway.  Since popular opinion says miners are the cause, and not nvidia for not making sufficient chips, nvidia claims they are doing something to address that issue.  This gives them a few months of tranquility. And then they will probably say miners bypassed their protection as a reason for the scalping to continue.",

    "answer": "The US government partly funds itself by issuing bonds (basically a specialized type of loan). Like any loan, they pay interest. For US government bonds issued by the US Treasury, we call this the \"treasury yield\". It's effectively the interest rate you get from loaning money to the US government. These are considered about the safest possible investment so any more risky loan (which is basically all of them) is going to have a higher interest than the treasury yield. If the treasury yield goes up (the government is paying higher interest), that pushes up the interest rate of \\*all\\* loans. It's a signal that investors are concerned that some combination of 1) the stock market might be dropping, so they're putting their money somewhere safer (bonds) and/or 2) investors are worried about inflation and want a higher yield to make up the value they're going to lose to inflation.  Right now it's some of both, hence the investors freaking out. If inflation gets high, investments have to perform better just to stay ahead of inflation, so their value goes down. And if interest rates get high, it gets more expensive to borrow money, which tends to slow the economy down and make everything more expensive.",

A similar technique worked for usb, but eventually more security was added to the computer firmware to prevent these types of attacks, at least with the default settings.             Protocol attacks rely on the host controller not properly error checking data from the device, so the device can fool the host machine into overrunning buffers, resetting important variables, or even jumping to code.             As an aside, there are also malicious USB sticks that use capacitors to build up an electrical charge and simply destroy the USB port and possibly the entire motherboard.

    "answer": "There would be no way to route traffic efficiently without IP addressing.  The only way it's done efficiently is by knowing based on network address where to route your traffic.  Think of it more like sending something in the mail, vs a phone book.  You need multiple pieces of information to get it to the right place right?  You need Zip Code (US), State, City, Street Address, and Person.  You mail that piece of mail from one side of the US to another, the first thing they do is look at that information to determine how it's going to get to it's destination.  You can't just put a name on there, as there is no way for the mail service to know that name out of the 300 million people living in the US.  So they start with ZIP code (which is really smaller than state), then narrow it down by street address, then eventually when it gets into your mailbox your wife hands you the mail because it ends up with your name on it.  Same way IPs work.  The numbers are not just randomly assigned.  Network address space is reserved by classes.  And routing tables know where those addresses are assigned to.  We know that everything 8.x.x.x is going somewhere, and everything that 9.x.x.x is going somewhere.  Then, as it gets closer to the destination, we use the additional digits to pinpoint where it's going until we get to the last digit and then we have the server.  Also, its VERY important to know, that name does not equal 1 server or IP address.  For example, when you go to [google.com](https://google.com) you go to 10000s of servers, not just a single server with a single IP address.  Also, for smaller setups, 1 server can house multiple IP addresses.  I have 5 domain names hosted on a single IP address.  That's why you can't just go to a name.  Really the name gets resolved to an address (or one in a pool of addresses), and then when you hit that server your browser says \"Hey, I'm trying to get to [myfavoritedomain.com](https://myfavoritedomain.com)\" and the web server serves it up.",

    "answer": "If I'm not mistaken, you're asking why in an enclosed are like a room, walls aren't always continuous but have columns sticking out. Is that it?  The answer is that, except in special cases, walls do not support anything (but their own weight), but columns do. This is why when you see a building being constructed, you see the frame (beams and columns) being built first, and then walls built later. This is why you sometimes see beams sticking out from the sides of the roof. In this case, we say that walls (called curtain walls) are not an active structural element: they do not contribute to the supporting frame. They're there like curtains: because nobody likes to live in a room with no walls (but they're also helpful in avoiding certain complex loads).  Slabs that make the floor are typically supported by the horizontal beams on the side (and sometimes columns when they're huge). Beams are supported by columns around the corners, and they're sometimes hidden. Columns are supported by the frame from the lower level, and so on..all the way to the foundations.  There are cases when architectural considerations make it difficult to use columns and beams only, so \"supporting walls\" are sometimes added.",

    "answer": "Can't answer the question though others have, but I do have a story on this -  Here in the UK we have a website called Right Move, which is basically a property listing website. Most estate agents will list on there from a small terrace house to a multi million \u00a3 mansion. A hobby for a surprising number of people (most will admit to doing the same if you mention you do it too) is to look around at really expensive properties, normally when you've bought a lottery ticket and start imagining what might happen if you win.  You can search huge areas, so I'd always look for somewhere with loads of land. Not that bothered about the house, but I always wanted to put on my own festival. I now do run festivals for a living (and I'm still poor) so realised a lottery win wasn't needed, but I digress.  I once found a place in somewhere like Oxfordshire, enormous amount of land, and oddly cheap. Looking at the photos is became weirder - several houses almost laid out like a street, in the middle of this old farmland. Anyone who's familiar with the UK would instantly recognise them as military style housing, just something about the style that gives them away. The usual smattering of farm buildings too, but they were fenced off. Not like quaint English farm fencing, full on Jurassic Park Category A Supermax prison style electric fencing.  Interest piqued, I read more into it - you were forbidden, by law with ongoing inspections by the Department of Health after purchase and continuing indefinitely, to farm and livestock or crops on the land. Ever.  More reading gave the answer - in the 1990s the UK had an outbreak of BSE or \"Mad Cow Disease\" itself a prion disease. There was footage in the news in the late 90s of cattle infected, filmed on a camcorder, footage from several years earlier that had since been declassified - cows struggling to stand, odd gait, basically \"mad\" and in the full throes of BSE. The footage was filmed at this farm - it was a UK government research centre set up to study the crisis, and was no longer needed. The infected animals were killed, incinerated, and the ashes dumped on the land. But it still isn't safe to use for any food production.  Like I say, the crisis was over by then, hence it being decommissioned, but reading further was 10 times worse than the worst horror film ever.  At one point the UK government thought BSE would turn into CJD in humans. Indeed, for a few hundred to date it has, but it has something like a 20 year incubation period, is totally incurable, and one of the worst diseases known to man. But the original fear was that anyone who'd eaten beef in the previous few decades, as in, fucking _everyone_ (vegetarianism being relatively rare in those days and beef being a stable) would develop CJD at some point in the next decade or two. Nevermind Covid, we're talking 28 Days Later type stuff.  Fortunately, for reasons I don't fully understand, but the comments have explained, it didn't happen.",

When you hold a piece of paper horizontally, it feels the same pressure on both sides, so it balances out and all that you feel is the weight of the paper itself.   Your body is mostly water, so it does not compress but when you free dive in water, as the pressure increases, the air pressure in your lungs does not increase so the water actually compresses your lungs.

This blue is then reflected back to my eyes, causing me to perceive the object as blue.  If I get that fabric wet with water, it's much harder for the object to reflect light back towards me. This is because water ALSO reflects light; you can see this when the sun blinds you reflecting off the ocean or a lake. If the fabric is soaked, some of the blue light that should be reflected towards my eyes is instead reflected back into the fabric.

    "question": "ELI5 If time is a dimension, why can you only go in one direction?",
    "answer": "Ok, so this is far from a fully accepted theory, but it *is* a theory, and based off some very well-accepted theories.   In General Relativity, you don\u2019t really \u201cmove\u201d through time. Instead, you *are* at all points in time.   As an example with lower dimensions so we can understand it intuitively, imagine a pen moving left and right. Then, as time progresses, you move the page downward under the pen, leaving a line on that page.   The left/right position of that line on the paper represents the spacial position of the pen, while the up/down position represents the temporal position of the pen.   If you look at a single horizontal slice of that line, and you move the horizontal slice upwards at a steady rate, you will see what *looks* like a point moving left and right, imitating the path that your pen took.   But you know that the horizontal slice giving the motion of the pen is actually only a slice of the full picture. In fact, the ink of the pen makes a full line. It just *exists* in both time and space. It\u2019s not moving, it\u2019s not going forward or backward, it\u2019s just a line sitting there.   The only way to see motion from this line is by only looking at a single moving slice - a single moment in time - at any given instant.   This is what happens in real life. You are a 4-dimensional, static line through spacetime. The reason you seem to move, think, and be dynamic in any way is because you\u2019re experiencing a single slice of time, a single instant in your \u201cworldline\u201d (that\u2019s the real name for it), and that slice of time you experience is moving forward through time at 1 second per second.   Ok, but here\u2019s where it gets really weird.   How do you know that you\u2019re progressing through time? You\u2019re only ever living in the exact present, it\u2019s not like you have a sense that tells you time is passing, so how do you know it is?  Generally, the response is that you remember all the past instants in time, right? That layer of recent memories tells you you\u2019re moving through time, forming new memories.   But (assuming we accept that memories are due to some arrangement of matter in your brain, and not caused by magic or spirits or whatever), there\u2019s absolutely no way for you to differentiate between actually progressing through time and developing new memories, or just being a static entity that can\u2019t move, or do anything, that\u2019s stuck in a single instant in time, but with memories from all the previous instants.   Essentially, the idea is you aren\u2019t moving through time, you\u2019re stuck in this exact moment, but with the *memories* in your brain telling you that you are moving through time.   So now, the question isn\u2019t \u201cwhy are we only moving in one direction through time\u201d because in fact, you aren\u2019t moving through time at all. You\u2019re just a single static slice of your 4-dimensional worldline with the memories making you *think* you\u2019re moving through time. Rather, the question is \u201cwhy do we only remember the past, and not the future\u201d.   And the general idea for that is because of entropy. Let\u2019s pretend that your brain is a watermelon, and you\u2019re trying to remember a hammer that\u2019s coming to smash that watermelon.   Now, theoretically, it\u2019s within the laws of physics for a smashed watermelon to spontaneously bounce off the ground, join together, and throw a hammer into the air. It\u2019s *possible*, but insanely unlikely, because every one of billions of trillions of particles would have to vibrate in exactly the right way at the right time to accomplish that.   On the other hand, it\u2019s *very* likely for a watermelon hit by a hammer to spontaneously smash. That\u2019s something that increases entropy, and you have common sense to realize that would happen.   So, if we see a smashed watermelon, we can pretty easily conclude, \u201chey, a hammer probably hit this\u201d. If we see an *unsmashed* watermelon though, you can\u2019t conclude \u201cthis watermelon probably solidified from many small chunks of watermelon on the ground and threw a hammer into the air\u201d.   In a way, you can say a smashed watermelon \u201cremembers\u201d into the past that it was hit by a hammer.   On the other hand, a solid watermelon can\u2019t \u201cremember\u201d into the future that it *will be* smashed, because the probability that a solid, unsmashed watermelon corresponds to being hit by a hammer in the future is so vanishingly small.   Your brain is basically that watermelon. It can\u2019t remember into the future because it\u2019s so insanely unlikely that a brain affected by the future would somehow reverse every process required to, for example, erase a memory, send the signal back down the optic nerve, causing your cones to yeet out photons into space.   **TL;DR:** *You don\u2019t move through time at all, you\u2019re stuck in time with memory of the past. You only remember the past and not the future because entropy*",
    "follow-up": "I always liked this idea. I'll expand on it and include a bit of quantum mechanics.   We all heard of Schrodinger's cat: the state of a quantum system is undefined until \"measured\",  that is it's all things it can possibly be at the same time (i.e. superposition). This measurement thing really puts a lot of weight and importance on the observer. But why should an observer be so special? We discovered a lot of new physics assuming we're not special at all. And what does it mean to be in multiple states at once?  The answer to this are correlations. Just like the watermelon remembered the hammer because of the exchange of information between those systems, quantum systems become entangled with other systems interacting with it, living a sort of \"trace\" that now makes the combined worldline of observer+system coherent, singular, as to be consistent with each other.  Systems in superpositions are systems that are not strongly correlated with the rest of the universe and so can experience a myriad of possible worldlines.   In the words of the previous analogy, quantum systems are multiple streaks on a single paper; when a pen traces a line, it is \"forced\" to choose one of the lines already there, because all the possible lines are already traced.  In this interpretation, called \"many worlds\" (because you can think of multiple pens streaking all the lines), the observer is nothing special. Something or someone that has not interacted with the new (observer+quantum) system yet will still hold the system is in a superposition.  A question that remains is how systems \"decide\" which streak or worldline to follow once entangled, and what mechanism is behind entanglement in the first place. This is called the \"measurement problem\""

    "question": "ELI5: If electrical providers share the same power lines, how do they know who is consuming whose power?",
    "answer": "In ERCOT (Texas) everything was \"unbundled\" when the industry was de-regulated (or re-regulated depending on your viewpoint). So generation is independent of transmission and distribution. Energy Service Providers (ESP's) sell energy to the end consumer buy buying energy from the generators through a QSE (Qualified Scheduling Entity) and delivering to the end user on transmission and distribution lines, which may or may not be one company. The distribution company (the \"Wires\" company) is the one that delivers your power to point of use. This is the one you have no choice over, since each has it's own territory.  Energy at every point (generation, transmission, distribution) is metered by extremely accurate meters that have to meet exacting standards. These are the \"settlement\" meters. There are also the meters on your home.  The \"settlement\" meters are  all time stamped at a minimum of every 15 minutes, although I believe generation is actually at 5 minute intervals. All this metering data is routed through ERCOT where generation output is matched against all the various transmission/distribution metering points, and ultimately balanced out against the end metering at your house. This is the only way it can be done, since the grid is entirely interconnected (internally), so generation is about like pumping a water well into a river, then monitoring who pulls water out.  Once all the data has been processed, fund allocations are made based on who bought what from whom at what price and what time. Even though the metering has 15 minutes intervals, the billing is usually done on an hourly basis.  Anyone can play. Grid generation is determined by who can offer \"base\" load at the cheapest price. This is the load that is pretty much there all the time. The \"intermediate\" load (i.e., the day gets warmer and load goes up from base) is the generation that is slightly more expensive. The highest cost generation comes on at peak (late afternoon in a Texas summer). The ESP's (remember them) try to study their load patterns, weather predictions, etc. and arrange through the QSE's to acquire given amounts of power at given times. Since \"anyone can play\" this means that the end user (you) can use a solar or wind turbine to generate back into the grid through your house meter and receive compensation.  ESP's are responsible for their costs. If they don't schedule enough energy, they end up paying a premium price at peak loads (aka, the recent ice storm). On the flip side, if they schedule too much and don't need it, they can either try to sell it on the market, or pay for it even though they didn't need it.  The \"wires\" companies get their money by fixed rates based on their \"cost of service\" and often tie in an extra charge based on kwh usage. They do not market \"energy\" unless they are an Electric Cooperative (which I think is unique to ERCOT). So the \"wires\" companys roll is to provide the actual service and metering.  There are more \"fun and games\" money making schemes like Congestion Revenue Rights if you want to look up an example of capitalism at it's finest (or worst).",

    "answer": "A recurrence relation is fundamentally a mathematical concept, so you're not going to fully understand it until you put some time in to think about the math. But here's an example of applying one.   Suppose you're cutting a piece of paper. Each time you cut the paper, you take all the pieces and stack them on top of each other, then cut right down the middle.   Now we want a function for the number of pieces of paper produced by c cuts. Intuitively, we know we'll go from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16... pieces of paper. We can therefore jump right to an analytic function: f(c) =2\\^(c-1). However, we can also write the recurrence relation. Each time we cut we double the number of pieces of paper we had before: r(c) = 2\\*r(c-1) for c>0. We also need to specify that we started with 1 piece of paper: r(0)=1.   Both ways of expressing the number of pieces of paper are valid and useful. For my money, the recurrence relation better expresses our intuition. Each cut produces twice as many pieces as the number we had before that cut. A computer is also very good at calculating the recurrence relation because it just means writing a simple function and calling it a bunch of times. This is not to say that a computer should have any trouble with 2\\^(c-1), but there are plenty of recursive expressions that don't have an analytical equivalent (like the Fibonacci sequence), yet they're still easy for computers. This is one reason why recurrence relations are such a big part of algorithms.",

    "question": "ELi5 Why are stars typically bigger than planets?",
    "answer": "Because this is how we define stars, planets and moons.  For planets and moons this is easy. If planets weren't bigger than their moons they wouldn't be planets. Moons are things that orbit planets. Orbiting is based on relative mass (smaller things orbit bigger things), so if a planet had a moon bigger than it, the planet would be the moon and the moon the planet. If they were similar sizes they'd orbit around each other, and wouldn't count as proper planets - instead being maybe dwarf planets or something similar.  For stars and planets we need to be careful what we mean by \"bigger.\" What makes stars stars and not planets is that they are *massive* enough (so have enough mass) that the are undergoing nuclear fusion. If you get enough mass together in one region, gravity pulls it in hard enough that the stuff starts squishing in awkward ways and explodes. Stars are a balance between gravity imploding the stuff they're made of, and fusion exploding it again.  So generally stars need to be larger in size than planets because - roughly speaking - stars and planets are made up of the same stuff, and if planets were bigger they'd probably have enough mass to start exploding and turn into stars.  That said, you do get some very small stars. Based on [this list of small stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_smallest_stars), around 20 of them are smaller than Jupiter - mostly White Dwarf stars and Neutron Stars. These are incredibly dense - they may have similar amounts of mass to the Sun (so enough mass to undergo fusion and so be stars), but that mass is squished down to an object maybe on a few kilometres across for the smallest.  To quote [Wikipedia's definition of a planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet):  > A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is **not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion,** and ... **has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals**.

Motor tics can be things like blinking, head shaking nodding and grimacing.  They can also be more complex like hitting, jumping and clapping.

    "question": "ELI5 : You know that *clic* when your tank is full at the gas station, how does that work ?",
    "answer": "My job is actually training people on how gas station equipment works!   Basically, when you dispense fuel, vapors are created by the fuel splashing down into your tank. The vapor can cause explosions and health problems. You would be surprised at how much vapor pours out if the vapor recovery is malfunctioning. It's hard to see, but quite dangerous. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM\\_fFApTciI)   The entire time you are fueling, the small holes towards the tip of the nozzle are sucking the vapors back into the dispenser. The moment the nozzle clicks off, the fuel has blocked those vapor recovery holes and triggered the dispenser to stop. Your tank is pretty much full and the vapor recovery will no longer properly work. So that last pump of fuel you're putting in is causing an explosion risk and putting you at higher risk for cancers and such, and polluting the air more than you realize. Not really worth it for an extra 50 cents of gas.  EDIT: as somebody correctly  points out, vapor recovery is not always required for auto shut off nozzles, because diesel has auto shut off as well. There is a separate hole next to the vapor recovery holes that trips the shut off. This prevents fuel from being sucked up the vapor holes. So it is using air flow, and installed directly next to vapor recovery, but not necessarily truly connected.",

    "answer": "So I\u2019m no expert and I\u2019m not sure exactly how age impacts the equation, but I would think that it probably increases recovery time and diminishes gains both intrinsically and as a result of the lost training from increased recovery periods.. that being said, gradually over time a person who practices regular cardio exercise will have more blood in their body, resulting in more visible veins. They will have a lower resting heart rate, and improved energy levels over someone who is more sedentary. They are at greater risk for joint injury, but proper supplements and weight exercise can mitigate these effects. As far as pulmonary health in concerned, if they\u2019re not actively smoking or contributing to worsening their lung health, it should improve health in this regard, even going so far as to reverse some of the harmful effects of past smoking.  At first, the training will be difficult and it\u2019s best to approach it in intervals of run/walk. Over the first month or 2 of consistent practice, this should get to the point where you\u2019re able to run consistently without the need to stop, and all the aforementioned benefits start to kick in. If you\u2019re looking for advice on training to be faster, plyometric workouts and integrating more interval-based training into your schedule are where you would want to look. Otherwise, it can just be something where you go out for a few miles a day and enjoy the leisure of moving freely.  Lastly, the key to any cardio exercise is core strength.

    "answer": "Incorrect!   The prefix post- doesn't mean \"rejection of\" in labelling these kinds of philosophical and artistic movements, but rather more \"acceptance of and progression from.\" So post-modernism is an acceptance of and progression from some of the things you attribute to it here.  To understand modernity and modernism as a broad ideology, it helps to consider the early 20thC context, where colonial atrocities and the horrors of WWI were starting to be hard to ignore for intellectuals. Modernists were intrinsically disillusioned by the old grand truths (or metanarratives) of the Western world: War is honourable. Religion is Civilization. Science is Progress. Modernists skewed nihilist. They sought to represent reality with granular truth, not grand truth, in formally innovative ways, and if the outcome was against moralistic messages of the past, so be it.  Post-modernism came about not as a rejection of this, but more as an acceptance that our structures and metanarratives, however illusionary,  are how we create meaning. They just tend to approach these grand institutions ironically (think a screenprinted soup can on an art gallery's wall: it's not denying cultural values, it's just trying to re-evaluate them in interesting ways. Or a Tarantino film that uses a generic Western franchise in homage, but also to discuss race by revising history). So where modernism was dismissive of grand narratives (like the American Dream), post-modernism is generally more playful. A lot of what we call post-modern is actually just modern, mind you.",

Printing stock option make the value of each option a little bit less. It dilutes them. Most investors don't like that at all.  But at the same time, it motivate the employee to make the company succeed as it increase the value of the shares and therefore the employee's income. So investors agree to have a little bit of that, typically, the higher up the hierarchy, the higher amount of your salary is in share form.  Every year the company will have a shareholder meeting where this kind of \"budget\" are voted. If you hold shares you can vote.  But the truth with shares (and that's why it's so hard to tax) is that they don't really have a monetary value until you try to sell them. And if a lot of share holder sell them at the same time, their value sink really quickly.

The second means the rings were always there, and are stable enough to last 4.5 billions years, implying they are going nowhere.

To make it more efficient, you would add extra 'lists' to be filled and keep track of, like word length x letter used - narrowing down the selection to choose from.

As someone else has explained, without blood vessels to deliver the necessary components and take away the debris, no repairs can happen. Adding some blood components may help somewhat, but it is the equivalent of airdropping a few truckloads of materials onto a construction site instead of having a road for trucks to constantly come in and out of. It will kind of allow some repair to happen, but it is not efficient.   The other problem is a lot harder to solve. Cartilage is mostly made of extracellular components, not live cells. When you were developing, cartilage making cells produced all those materials and left them there, but as the cells deposit the material that makes cartilage they end up trapping themselves inside of it. To go back to the construction site analogy, cells are the workers that take the materials and actually build something useful. It is useless to have all the needed materials but no workers to build with them, so even with adding all necessary components, if there's not enough cells left, nothing will get repaired.

    "answer": "There are actually many genes involved in balding, some connected to the x chromosome and some the y. The main baldness  gene is found to be on the maternal x chromosome. So if you are male, you inherited your x chromosome from your mom. So the likelihood of you becoming bald is fairly high if your mom's dad was bald. But remember your mom has two x chromosomes so she may not have passed on the gene to her male child.  The male child may have gotten the mom's x chromosome that doesn't carry the gene. So just because your mom's dad is bald doesn't mean you will be but your chances are higher. Now if your y chromosome,  which you get from your dad, carries one of those other baldness genes NOT related to the x chromosome,  you still have a chance of being bald even if you did not inherit your mother's chromosome that has the main baldness gene. So, If your maternal grandfather is bald you have a high likelihood of going bald. If your dad is bald too, you have an even higher chance of being bald because he may be bald due to a gene on his Y chromosome that causes baldness.",

    "answer": "Much of the problem here is that you\u2019ve loaded the question, haven\u2019t used proper, consistent quantifications, and have flawed logic.   It\u2019s not strictly true that hamsters won\u2019t willingly climb into hamster balls. It\u2019s not clear whether they can ever learn that an open hamster ball with a treat inside will lead to confinement in the ball.  It seems unlikely they recognize the risks. It\u2019s not difficult to find YouTube videos of a hamster going into a hamster ball willingly.   Hamster balls and exercise wheels aren\u2019t the same. A conclusion about a hamster ball doesn\u2019t necessarily also apply to exercise wheels.   You went from \u201cmost exercise wheels\u201d (quantified) to \u201cman-made exercise wheels\u201d (unquantified). Which is it?  Most? All? Many? Some? A few?  Finally, you\u2019ve ignored the obvious data. Hamsters, and other rodents, freely use exercise wheels in preference to running around their enclosures (though they do wander through their enclosures), though IIRC, they\u2019re much less likely to use a wheel if their enclosure is very large. They can\u2019t naturally get the distance from a typical enclosure that they get from their wheels.   The reality is that most people aren\u2019t going to have enclosures with enough space so that hamsters won\u2019t feel the need to use the wheel. So as long as the exercise wheel doesn\u2019t have dangerous problems, why shouldn\u2019t it be encouraged?

    "answer": "There is a misconception about WW1 that it was all trench warfare and mud. It actually wasnt and trench warfare of that scale was rather rare and there was large variety, you could have trench lines and a few kilometers away, you would have soldiers fighting in open and rather pleasant looking fields.  What made WW1 so nasty was that it was a war using old tactics with new weapons. This created a horrible meat grinder. You would have entire armies who had no doctorine to adapt to these new weapons so you could entire companies charging into machine guns because the idea of flanking or a pincher manuever wasnt perfected  WW1 also saw the invention of many nasty weapons. Chemicals were used everywhere and WW1 also saw the invention of the flamethrower and the tank. This was extremely jarring to the common soldier back then who was used to horse carriges and archaic bolt action rifles.  WW2 on the other hand was much more reminiscent of the wars we have today.

    "question": "ELI5: Is it just a coincidence that the color spectrum \"loops\" around?",
    "answer": "The sensation of colour is generated in our brains, as a way to interpret the signals from the cone cells in our eyes. The cone cells come in three different types, sensitive to different wavelength ranges of light. When light of a certain wavelength hits the retina, it stimulates the three different types of cone cells by different amounts. Those different amounts of stimulation are sent to your brain, where you brain assigns a \"colour\" to the combined signal.  As it happens, light of the shortest wavelengths we can detect, around 400 nanometres, our brain interprets as \"violet\", while light of the longest detectable wavelengths (around 750 nm), our brain interprets as \"red\". The fact that red and violet seem to be similar colours that can blend into one another comes from the fact that our brain also needs a way to interpret a *mixture* of wavelengths, some around 400nm plus some around 750nm, with no intermediate wavelengths.  If you have a mixture of 400nm plus 750nm light, your brain gets signals from the short wavelength and long wavelength sensitive cone cells, but *none* from the middle wavelength cone cells. Your brain interprets this as magenta - a colour \"in between\" violet and red. Magenta cannot be generated by a single wavelength of light - it's not in the rainbow.  Your brain needs to be able to move continuously from violet to red via this magenta sensation, to account for different ratios of short+long wavelength light. So your brain considers this to be a continuum of colours fading smoothly into one another.  **In summary:** No, it's not a coincidence. But it's also not an inherent \"fact of nature\" that 400nm light looks \"similar\" to 650nm light. It's a result of the architecture of our eyes and brain.  For example, birds have extra cone cells sensitive to ultraviolet light. To them, 400nm and 750nm light most likely look very different, and the wrapping around in \"colour\" only occurs for the wavelengths around 250nm (in the UV where we can't see) and 750nm.",

To get the texture and taste of chocolate just right, you really have to dial in the proportions of these ingredients.   So if you want to remove the sugar, you're going to have to replace it with something else. The usual way is to increase the content of cocoa solids to replace sugar, which will result in a harder and darker chocolate.

Just like how it is harder to accelerate a container ship than a bicycle.  Those two things cancel each other out.  We're not entirely sure why.

It's not that there's less water overall, it's just that changing weather patterns changes where the water is going, which is places were it's either not needed or inaccessible.   For example, less winter snow in the Rocky Mountains means less spring and summer water in the Colorado River watershed which provides water for much of The Southwestern U.S., eventually emptying in the Pacific. At the same time, Typhoons in the pacific are getting bigger and more frequent, so there's more water being dumped back into the ocean.

Everyday pain (particularly in elderly) : acetaminophen/paracetamol (Tylenol). Can be hard on the liver.  Arthritis pain: when the OTC pain killers don't cut it, other NSAIDs such as meloxicam (Mobic) or celecoxib (Celebrex) can be used. Easier on the stomach, harder on the heart.  More intense pain: injectable NSAIDs like ketorolac (Toradol) (really hard on kidneys) or opioids.   Nerve pain: not many great options, but gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), and a class of antidepressants called SNRIs (duloxetine and venlafaxine are the parent molecules) can be used. Methadone has also been useful in certain cases.   Centralized pain: this is a weird kind of pain where there isn't necessarily anything wrong, but you've been in pain so long that the pain center of your brain misfires and tells you you're in pain. Very hard to treat, but treatment is similar to nerve pain.   Migraines: NSAIDs can be used OTC. Generally people need something stronger and will be prescribed a triptan (sumatriptan, rizatriptan, etc.). There are a bunch of new and interesting drugs that just came out that treat and prevent migraines.   Tension headaches: A mix of an NSAID or acetaminophen, caffeine, and phenobarbital.   Cancer pain: generally opioids. Can step down if the pain isn't too bad.   Bone pain (usually associated with bone cancer, chemo, or bone marrow transplant): can use zoledronic acid and/or an antihistamine like Claritin or Zyrtec.

You can however still feel hungry in this case depending on what you eat.  The other feeling is feeling satiated (not hungry). In order to feel this you need to eat enough food to fill your stomach to a certain degree but also eat enough nutrients. In particular you need to eat enough protein and certain fats.  These nutrients are needed by your body and there are special nerve receptors that won't stop sending the \"I am hungry\" signal until enough nutrients have been consumed.  Depending on what you eat you will also stay satiated for a longer time as certain combinations of food will inhibit the bodys ability to digest and make use of the nutrients.  For example if you eat 4 eggs for breakfast you will feel satiated longer than if you eat 4 eggs and a piece of white bread.

Also, apparently keeping a cool head allows your body to expel heat more effectively (understandably). Since keeping your body warm takes energy and sort of defeats the purpose of sleep (that being to rest), we can imagine why we want to expel this heat. The body temperature we keep while awake is such because our chemical reactions and electrical signals in our body happen most efficiently at these temperatures. We don\u2019t really need to be think and act while asleep, so this conservation of energy while resting makes sense.   So body saves energy and rests easier by being a bit colder. Keeping a cool head is important to expel heat.

Now, if you shuffle the deck, so that the cards are completely randomized, you've raised the entropy of the deck. You can rearrange the individual cards very freely without damaging your ability to say \"Yes, that's a shuffled pack of cards.\"  Another way to think of entropy is the ability to pull useful work out of a system. For example, you need a temperature difference to do any work with a heat engine; if there's no gradient, nothing's going to want to move from point A to point B.

    "answer": "Mixing random numbers with non-random numbers won't make the random numbers any *less* random. You can simply XOR together a stream of random numbers with a stream of deterministic data and the result will be just as random as before. (Caveat: assuming the other stream doesn't depend on the stream of random numbers.) It *is* important to make sure you can't *independently* predict the output of the random number stream, because if you knew the random numbers in advance you could construct a source of entropy that perfectly cancels it out. But in that case, you can already predict the output of the PRNG anyways so you don't really have entropy to begin with. The only way for entropy to spontaneously decrease is if you have prior information about the system. (This is as true in thermodynamics as it is in computing)  The main challenge you face when designing entropy pools is figuring out how to measure the amount of entropy you have access to. The risk of bad entropy sources somehow \"drowning out\" good entropy sources doesn't exist - in practice, your only concern is that bad entropy sources might provide an incorrectly high *estimate* of entropy, so that something like a cryptographic key exchange protocol might go ahead with using random numbers despite lack of sufficient entropy to guarantee randomness of those numbers.",

    "answer": "There is a central bank in America called the Federal Reserve (the Fed); the Fed has one lever it can pull to slow down or speed up the economy and its raising or lowering interest rates.  When the economy is doing well and jobs are abundant, it raises interest rates to encourage people to save money, when it's slow it lowers interest rates to encourage people to borrow money.  The Fed lends money to banks when in turn lends money to consumers.  When a person walks into a bank and borrows $1,000,000 to build a new factory $1,000,000 is added to the economy.  Part of that $1M might go to pay the wages of a construction worker that now has a steady job to take out a $270k loan for a new house, so now $270,000 just got added to the original $1M.  The Fed tries to target the rate of inflation at around 2%.  You want to encourage people to spend money; if money were getting more and more valuable every day and prices were steadily dropping, the economy would drastically slow down.  The money you  borrow today would be paid off tomorrow in more expensive dollars; why would you buy a house today for $300,000 when you can buy it next year for $275?  Inflation happens because the ratio of money circulating in the economy increases faster than the amount of goods and services being produced.  In the case of the inflation we're seeing now, COVID-19 caused the amount of goods and services being produced to drastically decrease, but people still demanded those goods and services because most world governments sent their citizens money to prevent the economy from collapsing.",

The theory is if you have a high number of antibodies, you may be sensitive to that food.   They test for the antibodies by exposing the blood to samples of the food, then check and see how many antibodies attached to each food tested.   If I understand correctly, unlike some other blood tests this means you are only using up blood that reacts to the food samples (presumably with some waste), since they will not attach to food they do not react to, and as such you don't have to \"use up\" as much blood",

    "question": "ELI5: Why are v8 engines over 5 liters in size common but i4 engines over 2.5 liters are very uncommon?",
    "answer": "I4 engines have excellent Primary Balance characteristics, meaning vibration due to the up-down motion of the pistons cancels each other out. It's easy to see why this works in animations of such engines.  However i4 engines have unusually poor *Second-Order Balance.*   Second-Order balance, also called secondary balance is related to the inevitable side-to-side rocking motion of the connecting rods. This motion causes the center of mass of the connecting rod to not move perfectly in sync with the CM of the piston. Rather, the connecting rod CM moves closer to the top surface of piston by a few mm, at the middle of the stroke then back again at bottom and top dead center. The term \"Second Order\" refers to the fact that this vibration occurs two times per revolution of the crankshaft.   What's worse, in an i4 these vibrations are perfectly in phase with each other with all 4 cylinders.  The fewest number of cylinders you can have and still have good secondary balance is 6.  I6 engines are inherently very well balanced. This is why many large heavily turbocharged diesel engines use this configuration.   At higher engine speed second-order forces grow in relation to the *square* of the crankshaft RPM, rather than in a linear fashion. This means that if you double the RPM the secondary vibration grows by 4x, and if you triple the RPM the vibration grows by 9x. So it's easy to see that this could lead to catastrophic engine failure to the tune of throwing a connecting rod in an i4.  To counteract this ~~almost all~~ (EDIT: *the majority of*) i4 engines have balancing shafts with counterweights that rotate at twice the engine RPM to prevent the engine from shaking itself off the engine mounts above, say, 2500RPM. Indeed most engines with less than 6 cylinders have balancing shafts of some type. This is far from a perfect solution with i4's since this still produces additional forces on the engine block between the crankshaft and balancer bearings that are less than desirable. The balancer shafts consume power themselves and result in higher vibration at idle speed. Their inertia reduces engine revving.   This brings us to the other prescription for the secondary balance problem, which is to reduce the engine redline. It's hard to get around this second part.   So, above 2.8L or so, you end up with a  Law-of -Diminishing-Returns relationship where larger and larger cylinders necessitate heavier connecting rods that cause greater and greater secondary vibration. This means you need to reduce the engine operating speed while using an increasingly heavy balancing shaft that consumes more power, causes more idle vibration, and induces more forces into the engine block between it's own bearings and the crankshaft main bearing. Thus, necessitating a thicker, heavier crankshaft and engine block. Beyond a certain point the fact that you're invariably forced to reduce the redline and increase engine weight in a way that's disproportionate to the displacement, wipes out any additional power you'd gain by increasing the cylinder size. Say, above about 3.5L  A V-8 deals with the secondary balance problem by operating each bank 90\u00b0 out of phase to each other, so that second-order forces in each bank tend to cancel each other instead of adding together constructively. However V-8s often use balancer shafts to counteract high RPM vibrations. The same can be much smaller on V-8 with respect to displacement, a V-8 with 6L does not need a balance shaft twice as large as an i4 with 3L. In fact a smaller one can be used in the former V8.  In V-6 engines there is good second order balance, but you have a moderate issue with primary balance.  A three cylinder engine does not have the outstanding primary balance of an i4, but it is better than a single cylinder. Specifically, in an i3 the uo and down monitions of the pistons to not always perfectly counteract each other. In a V6, unbalanced primary forces can be made to counteract each other best using a 60\u00b0 angle, but this does not entirely eliminate them. So V-6s have primary balance that is not quite a good as V-8's and they vibrate more. Again the usual solution is to reduce the redline RPM. Balancer shafts are also common on v6's  Another solution to the secondary balance problem is the one used by Karl Frederich Benz. He and his company produced the first flat-four opposed piston engine in 1900, using a boxer configuration that should ne familiar to fans of subaru, Porche, or VW cars.   These engines were used in Benz's racing cars, they had 5.4 liters and produced 20 HP, which was excellent at the time. The engines did not need balancer shafts at all and operated much more smoothly than the engines of Benz's competitors.  So why aren't flat-four boxer engines used on most cars? Well because they're significantly more difficult to produce and precision-assemble, and create a number of other less than obvious technical problems.",

It can be water that wicks out as a liquid from your skin and then evaporate and become a gas, it can also be water the evaporate on your skin. Regardless of how it happens if your water can't escape you will be weat.  So if you have clothes that do not let water through and sweat will stay inside them and are what.    Cloth is not warming you unless they have an active heat source, which is quite uncommon but to exist. What clothes do is reduce the rate hat is transported from your body to the environment. The way is done is primary to have material that traps a lot of air and stops it from moving. Air is a bad conductor of heat so this will keep you warm. Water is a good conductor of heat and will so water-soaked closed will transport heat away from your body and you get cold.  If you keep water from escaping you also keep air from escaping and that will reduce the rate heat is transported from your body.  So they will make you warmer but can make you warm and then you sweat.  So if you sweat profusely the clothes are keeping you warm or more exactly to warm. They might not keep you warm when they are wet but then you have stopped sweating.  One major way to stay warm is to remove clothes when you are active so you do not sweat. If you will do some physical activity that makes you warm remove clothes so you start to feel a bit too cold when stationary. When you then start to move you will get warmer and hopefully, you do not get so hot so you sweat.  It is a mistake to dress for being stationary and then start moving. Regardless of what material your clothes are made of you will sweat and if it can't escape you get colder when you stop. Dress in layers and adjust the clothing to your activity,",

    "answer": "Believe it or not, we do it by looking at what color they are.  Stars emit light that's a mixture of many different colors.  Chemical elements, on the other hand, tend to absorb particular colors.  So we wait for a distant planet to pass between us and star, and then we look at what colors from that star's light got absorbed by the planet; that tells us what elements are in its atmosphere.  (Think of a planet's atmosphere as being sort of like a stained-glass window.  Even though we've only got a single pixel of light, if we know what colors *could* be in the window, we can figure out how many panes of each color it must have in order to produce the pixel that we're seeing.)  If you're interested in what elements are in the planet's core rather than it's atmosphere, that's harder.

If the bullet had a lot of energy going out of the barrel, it now has none. What it has, though, is height, and it is still being accelerated by gravity! Since the friction is zero at this point, the bullet will simply fall and gain speed.  Going down, as its speed increases, so will the friction : at some point the friction will be so strong that the bullet won't accelerate due to gravity anymore: it will have reached its terminal velocity.

    "question": "ELI5:Why would a medically induced coma be used to treat an overdose?",
    "answer": "First of all, \u201cmedically induced coma\u201d isn\u2019t a medical term. What it actually refers to is a combination of pain medicine and sedation medicine that are used to keep people calm and comfortable while they have a breathing tube in.   Second, this \u201ccoma\u201d or state of sedation isn\u2019t done to treat the overdose itself. It is done again to allow for uncomfortable medical interventions such as a breathing tube and possibly cooling (targeted temperature management).  When he overdosed, his breathing became so slow and shallow and he did not get enough oxygen and he could not blow out carbon dioxide. When the heart doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen it will stop beating. When the brain doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen for long enough, it causes brain damage (anoxic brain injury).   CPR is used to circulate blood as we try to restart the heart with medication and/or shocks.  A breathing tube is placed to breath for the patient until they can breath on their own.  When a patient has cardiac/respiratory arrest, they almost always have some amount of brain damage, unless high quality CPR was started immediately. We keep them on ventilators (breathing machine connected to the breathing tube that goes down his throat) because the brain damage means he likely wont be able to breath on his own for a while. In many cases after cardiac arrest we also \u201ccool\u201d the patient.

The Hui Minority are also Muslims; they are also a larger minority than the uyghurs. Why are they well loved and not being \"genocided\"? Clearly it isn't about Islam.  2. Two of China's most famous actresses are uyghur; Dilireba Dilmurat and G\u00fclnezer Bextiyar. Dilireba is probably top 3 right now in all of China. Imagine Hitler in 1937 trying to commit genocide on the Jews. Do you think he would allow two Jewish actors to become the top celebrities in Austrio-Germany?  3. The west pretty much never talks about the terrorist attacks that happens in Xinjiang. You probably don't even know about the [uyghur terrorists bombing han people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Aksu_bombing) [ ^2 like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_%C3%9Cr%C3%BCmqi_bus_bombings)[ ^3 and other knife/bomb attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Hotan_attack)[ ^4 or this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Kashgar_attacks)[ ^5 or this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2014_%C3%9Cr%C3%BCmqi_attack)[ ^6 or this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Kunming_attack)[ ^7 or this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_%C3%9Cr%C3%BCmqi_bombings)  I hope you get my point.

That quickly became infeasible so instead they came up with a method that basically organized everything into a hierarchical structure, kind of like a tree.  At the base of the tree you have a single root, which then has multiple branches, and those branches have branches, and so on, until you get to the leaves.  [www.google.com](https://www.google.com) for example, is a leaf on this tree. Specifically the \"www\" is a leaf on the \"google\" branch which is a branch on the \"com\" root.  Now, the whole point of all of this is for your computer to be able to take a URL like \"[www.google.com](https://www.google.com)\" and convert it into an IP address because it is the actual IP address that computers need to talk. But, as we said, we can't just have a big ol' directory. There is just too much stuff and it's too dynamic.  Instead, we exploit the hierarchical nature of the tree. We go to the \".com\" tree and ask it, \"Who is responsible for holding all of the information of the 'google' branch?\" And it tells us. Then we go to that place and ask it \"Ok, who is responsible for holding all of the information of the 'www' leaf?\" And it tells us, and we go to that place and ask it \"Ok, give me the IP information for '[www.google.com](https://www.google.com)'\" And it tells you, and then your computer can communicate with it.

    "answer": "There are two concepts and it can get conflated.  Humans MEASURING time is completely a human construct. What we call hours, minutes and seconds are simply measurements of time. Time \"exists\" independent of whether humans exists - and one way to look at it is that time separates cause from effect. When some thing causes another thing to happen, then it occurs earlier (as we term it) than the result it causes.  As to relativity, this is again easy to get wrapped in confusion. Say you can read a book in an hour while sitting here on earth. Now we put you on a really fast spaceship headed away from earth and gave you that same book to read. Do you read it faster or slower? Actually, from YOUR perspective, it takes an hour to read as it did when you were on earth. Your LOCAL perspective of time does not change regardless of how fast you travel. To an observer on earth, though, it appears TO THEM, that you read the book slower in the spaceship than when you were sitting next to them on earth.   The simplest explanation is that since the spaceship is travelling away from the other observer, the time taken for light to travel gets longer and longer. Say something takes 1 second from start to finish from the spaceship's perspective. The light that travels from the start of the event travels a shorter distance than the light travelling at the end of the event to the observer. To the observer, this makes it appear as though the time from start to finish took longer to occur on the spaceship than 1 second.",

It\u2019s a myth that\u2019s spread everywhere because it\u2019s so compelling; it\u2019s one of those explanations that just clicks and makes sense. But it\u2019s not supported by the science. The real drivers of muscle growth are mechanical tension and metabolic stress. Mechanical tension is basically your muscles freaking out over how heavy a weight feels, and deciding to get stronger so that it feels less heavy. Metabolic stress is your body trying to feed energy into your muscles and not being able to keep up with the demand, and deciding to level up the muscles so they need less metabolic support.  Edit: in response to people taking issue with \u201cmyth\u201d - the popular meme \u201cwhy does muscle grow from weight lifting? Cause they get damaged and grow back stronger/bigger\u201d is ABSOLUTELY a myth. The best opposing case that could be made is that muscle damage is one of the three primary drivers of muscle growth, but every expert I\u2019ve read has implied that research over the past decade or so has been building a case that muscle damage is merely correlated with muscle growth under many circumstances. It\u2019s difficult to establish concretely that muscle damage has absolutely nothing to do with growth when pretty much all weight training causes some damage.

    "answer": "Until someone comes with more energy to get into detail, real brief & pre-k:  Sugar (glucose is the simplest form, and the most rapidly absorbed)* hitting your bloodstream causes insulin release, a hormone made by your pancreas.  Insulin acts as the key to help glucose get into cells (they need it for energy, extra is stored for later).  If a lot of glucose hits your blood suddenly, a lot of insulin has to be released too.  But if insulin keeps pestering the cells too much, they eventually get insensitive to it, and they need more insulin to open the same amount of doors.  So whereas, before, say you needed 10 insulin for 10 glucose (made up #s) now you need 100 insulin for 10 glucose and so on, it worsens.  Your pancreas too keeps having to put out more insulin, eventually it tires out.  So at some point your cells just aren\u2019t responding to the amount of insulin you produce, there\u2019s not enough insulin to remove all that glucose from your blood, and you\u2019ve got high blood glucose (which damages organs/tissues).  You\u2019ll need drugs either to help your pancreas release/produce more insulin, or straight up need insulin injections.  *Simple sugars are bad bc they\u2019re already glucose/almost glucose.  So 50g of skittles hit your blood as glucose faster than 50g of a more complex carb which will take longer to get broken down to glucose and will thus give your pancreas more time to trickle out insulin, and your cells more time to welcome a trickle of insulin rather than a sudden onslaught, making them less likely to get intolerant.  You\u2019ll also have less glucose floating freely in your blood, causing mischief.  *Edit:* Also yeah, as someone else correctly mentioned, it\u2019s excess body fat that more directly causes diabetes to develop; you can be long-term overweight and get diabetes without having eaten a single simple sugar food in your life (although glucose still gets formed by the breakdown of your meals).

    "question": "ELI5: How does Netflix Make money on it's original series like \"Squid Game?\"",
    "answer": "The way Netflix works is that it makes you sign up for the service, and then tries to prevent you cancelling your subscription. 900 million dollars is what Netflix estimates they'll bring in from the combination of people who subscribed to the service because of squid game, and people who will continue their subscription after squid game where they otherwise might have chosen to cancel it.   Netflix's whole thing is that it makes just enough good content for you to think you should keep your subscription going. It measures the effectiveness of content in terms of watch time - how much time the userbase as a whole spends watching a show. It takes that number and compares it to the cost of making the show, the total time users spend watching *all* content on Netflix, and the subscription fees people pay to figure out an estimate of how much money the show makes for them. This is basically a number of how much money they think they  *wouldn't* have made if they *hadn't* made Squid Game, from people cancelling their subscriptions or just not signing up in the first place.",
    "follow-up": "Exactly. It\u2019s a *but-for* calculation. \u201cBut-for *Squid Game*, what would Netflix revenues have been?\u201d  For a big show premiere, you can use an event study to estimate effects on viewership and new customers, and then extrapolate the trends (using data from past premieres) to estimate the total effect. Basically, how much did viewership/sign-ups jump, and how long will these effect be expected to last?   Estimating this for smaller shows is probably a lot more difficult, because each show cannibalizes viewership for other shows and these shows probably don\u2019t do much for new sign-ups but help more with retention of existing customers."

    "answer": "Food intolerance (like lactose) is not an allergy. Most adult humans lose ability to produce an enzyme needed to digest lactose as they mature; some populations are more likely to keep it than others. Because you can\u2019t properly digest lactose, it ends up as sugar in your lower intestine, where certain bacteria use it as abundant food, growing more than they would normally and upsetting the balance with the rest of the flora that eventually results in gas/cramping/diarrhoea etc as your intestines try to get rid of the irritant.   Allergies are a consequence of your immune system encountering substances (often proteins, though not exclusively), that it identifies as harmful. It\u2019s a normal part of the immune system\u2019s function to detect and react to foreign substances - that\u2019s how it fights off infections by bacteria, viruses and parasites. But sometimes, it overreacts to things it shouldn\u2019t, like food, drugs, pollen etc - these are not harmful on their own, but the immune system responds as if they are and the mechanisms that would stop it from overreacting might be slow or weak. So you get allergic reactions. Obviously, not everyone is allergic to the same thing - I can eat as many peanuts as I want, but if I touch some insecticides, I get hives and eventually end up suffocating; you might react the same to strawberries.

On the other hand, moderate-high intensity cardio exercise is typically seen to lead to improved blood flow efficiencies along with a stronger heart and indicators of increased performance metrics such as improved VO2max which has shown to lead to a higher quality of life.  Both types of exercise have benefits such as improved glucose (sugar) uptake which helps with diseases such as diabetes, has shown to have mental health and motivational benefits, and combats obesity which is related to other diseases.

    "question": "ELI5: What is the actual purpose of AC power?",
    "answer": "Electric generators and motors can use dc or ac, not both.  DC generators and motors need brushes to catch the power from the spinning part, and this brushes require big big maintenance. When AC was discovered, it allowed to make generators and motors at 2/3 of the price of a DC one, and they are completely maintenance free, because they don\u2019t need a brush system. So they won, and were adopted in mass.  Not having brushes allows to produce higher voltages without issues. Higher voltage allows to  transfer the same power using thinner wires, this makes transport and the generator parts to be done with thin cheaper wires, saving even more money.  Then the power transport in cables has losses along the line, electrons flow heats the cables, with high voltage, you can transport power by moving fewer electrons but with higher force in each of them. So again, another win for high voltage systems, and again high voltage production is easier if done in AC. There are DC high voltage lines, for example, submarine cables and nation to nation lines may be high voltage DC; not so common but it\u2019s done sometime, for example, a country with 115v 50hz AC may transform it to DC to sell it to another country that then transforms it into its own 220V 60hz AC. This is done because the 2 different AC systems are completely incompatible, because both need to transform it, they may have a DC line between them.  Add in that illumination can be done with DC or AC without difference.   Basically the only drawback for AC is computers. Computers need low voltage DC. So we use an AC line for everything, and transform it to low voltage DC only in the devices that need it. Another thing that can\u2019t work in AC are batteries, so any system that has a battery needs to be DC. This doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t do a AC system with a DC conversion between system and battery, sometime it\u2019s done, it\u2019s overly expensive but may be done.",

    "question": "ELI5: Once a lottery like Mega Millions has a high enough jackpot so that the expected value of the ticket is higher than the cost, why does it still feel like it\u2019s a bad investment to buy a ticket?",
    "answer": "Let's simplify things and consider a lottery that just has one big jackpot and no other prizes. Let's say the odds of winning this jackpot are 1 in 300 million (that's roughly the [odds](https://www.megamillions.com/How-to-Play.aspx) for getting all the numbers right to win the Mega Millions jackpot). Instead of drawing a set of numbers, let's say you just roll a 300 million-sided die and you win the jackpot if it comes up '1'. Let's say the jackpot is $1 billion and it costs $2 for each roll of the die.  Your expected winnings per roll are $1 billion / 300 million = $3.33. Clearly, that's more than it costs and so statistically you expect to make a profit. That is, if you could roll the die enough times, your winnings would equal $3.33 per roll, for a profit of $1.33 per roll. For instance, if you were able to play 1 trillion times, you'd almost certainly make a profit close to $1.33 trillion.  The problem, of course, is that you can't afford to play 1 trillion times. You have neither the time nor the upfront cash to finance that. So it doesn't matter how the statistics work out in the long run. The important thing is: is there a reasonable probability that you'll make a return on your investment before either your time or your money runs out?   Clearly, you need to win the jackpot at least once in order to have a chance to make a profit. Note that you're not guaranteed to make a profit once you win - if it takes too many rolls, you'll still be making a loss. But if you don't win even once, you'll certainly make a loss.  So how often do you need to roll the die to win the jackpot at least once? Well, it's never a sure thing that you'll win, but let's say we want to have at least an 80% probability. How often do we need to roll the die for that? The probability that you'll wint the jackpot at least once in N rolls is 1-p^(N) where p is the probability of not winning, i.e. 1-(1/300 million). So we have to solve 1-p^(N) = 0.8, i.e. p^(N) = 0.2. We can solve this by taking the logarithm of 0.2 in base *p*. If none of that makes sense to you, don't worry, just note that this is a mathematical way of answering the question: how many times do I need to roll this die so that I'll have an 80% probability of winning the jackpot at least once?  The answer turns out to be over 482 million times. That's an investment of $964 million, not to mention how much time it takes to roll a die that many times.  And therein lies the rub. You do not have the time nor the money to play the lottery enough times to have any reasonable hope of making a return on your investment. Not to mention, how are you even going to buy that many lottery tickets? They don't stock that many at your local corner store, and I doubt that Mega Millions is going to allow you to purchase that many tickets from them directly.  Also, note that even with 482 million rolls, there's still a 20% chance that you don't win the jackpot, and then you've accumulated losses of almost $1 trillion. To really be sure of a profit, you need to be playing tens of billions of times.  **In short, the problem is that the expected profit comes from a teenie, tiny probability of winning a large amount of money. If you had a 50% probability of winning $6.66 on a ticket that costs $2, the expected profit would also be $1.33 per ticket, only then you'd only have to play like a dozen times in order to be pretty sure of a profit. So it's not about the expected value of the winnings distribution, it's about how uneven it is.**",

    "answer": "A musical scale is a series of notes that repeat after an octave. Scales in western music usually have 7 notes, with the eighth being an octave of the first note. An octave is just two notes that sound the same, but one sounds \"higher\" than the other.  In western music, there are 12 notes that repeat: A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, then it starts repeating with A again. [Here's a picture to show how the notes are arranged on part of a piano keyboard](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3c/83/a7/3c83a794158355fe0e58232d9ce56e34.jpg). The # and \u266d note names (the names of the black keys) are interchangeable.  When you play a scale, you aren't playing all the notes. To simplify a lot, some notes just *sound better* when you group them together. If you were to just play all the notes, it might sound like chaos.  For instance, the most common scale in western music is the major scale. You can pick any note and play a major scale starting with that note. If you pick the major scale starting on C, the notes will be C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. If you pick the G major scale, the notes will be G, A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. To figure it out yourself, use this pattern: you can pick a note (call it the *root note* of the scale), then move up the keyboard (to the right) by this set of steps: skip a note, skip a note, don't skip a note, skip a note, skip a note, skip a note, don't skip a note. And that's a major scale.  If you were to \"play in a scale\", you can play any of the notes in that scale in whatever order you want, and they'll \"sound good\" with anyone else playing in that scale.  There are a lot of different kind of scales, and using them in different ways, in combination with each other, helps us to make interesting songs, based on the basic concept of tension and release.",

    "answer": "Technically it means any computer which can perform the same computations as Turing's imaginary, theoretical machine.  He invented it essentially as the simplest-possible computer to make it easier to make mathematical proofs about computing.  While simple, it does possess an infinite storage device which real-world computers obviously can't; Turing Completeness doesn't say anything about the size of computations that a computer is capable of solving, or about its speed.  So, ignoring real-world limitations like speed and storage capacity, all Turing Complete computers can solve the same set of problems.  There are no magical capabilities that open up the ability to solve new classes of problems.  Essentially all the world's CPUs are Turing Complete; they can all solve the same problems, subject only to their limited storage capacity.",

    "question": "ELI5 - Where did the Bible come from?",
    "answer": "Not so much answering your question, but adding/responding to to a number of other comments I\u2019ve read in the thread  First: On the basis of historical robustness - meaning how well it\u2019s accuracy could survive over the years, I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s about as reliable as any other ancient text, theistic or secular.  There are tons of historical accounts from authors of Greek, Roman, and other origins that are our only insights to history that we work off of, despite knowing that they\u2019re often biased, come from a limited perspective, are imperfectly translated, and are usually dramatized.  Yet when it comes to the Bible, people are very quick to criticize it for the same problems. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me.  Second: I do think there needs to be more to someone\u2019s faith than just what they read in the Bible. It gives us insight to God\u2019s heart, and some guidance/instruction to carry on our way, but it can\u2019t be everything.  If we as Christians believe the Gospel, then we also have to believe God is still active and moving today. We have to live out our faith, and experiencing all that comes with it through our lives.  As a side note to that, I think that might be why some people struggle to understand Christianity. They view us as being entirely rooted to these events from 2000 years ago. What\u2019s missed is that our faith is rooted in *our* experiences. However, many \u201cChristians\u201d don\u2019t live their lives that way, so it isn\u2019t seen, and it\u2019s just not apparent to others.",

Once you reach earth you do have a target range but your flight is calculated to take you right to the ocean where ships are waiting.

    "answer": "When you think, how would you describe the process that is happening in your head? Do you just suddenly and instantly complete the thought from beginning to end, or is there a process? If I tell you to picture an apple for five seconds, what happens inside your head?  Some people will think using language: they become aware of words forming in their head that state out the thought they have. Some people will compare this to \"hearing\" a voice in your head but I always go very carefully in to those analogies because I've found people thinking they don't have an internal monologue because they literally don't hear an audible voice going off in their head.  Many people will also use images: when people imagine something they become aware of an \"image\". Usually this image doesn't have a lot of detail and it's hard to keep it steady for long, but people generally will f.i get a sense of a red apple with a stem and two leaves when asked to picture an apple. This is often likened to \"seeing\" stuff in your head, but note that most people don't hallucinate and see a floating apple ten inches in front of their head, even if they are imagining something.  People can think in all sorts of senses and often a mix of them: they picture apples, hear their favorite songs, recall a bad smell. This all happens on a scale, some have stronger connections to certain senses than others and will be more visual thinkers, or more tactile, or have stronger internal emotions, or whatever. Whatever is happening in your head when I ask you to think about something, try to imagine doing that in relation to one of your senses.

It's a finite amount of oxygen contained withing the compressed cork itself, thats why they seal the bottle with wax or a metal wrapper outside the cork.

The FDA requires all medications to have an expiration date of no later than two years after the date of manufacture, regardless of how long the medicine actually stays good.  Many medications stay effective long after that, its mostly just a matter of trying it and seeing if it still works.  You just don't want to take more than whatever the normal dose is, even if it seems less effective, since some medications have a very low margin of safety and so taking 3 pills that are 75% effective as opposed to 2 that are 100% might put you over that, for example.  The FDA requires expired medications to be safe if you are taking no more than the maximum dose of them.  IE, if a medication says to take 2 pills it will *always* be safe to take 2 pills regardless of how expired the medication is.  Again, the worst thing that happens is it just does nothing.

    "answer": "When you deposited gold in a bank, they would give you a receipt. Trading actual gold coins is difficult, because they're heavy, it's hard to make change etc. so what people started doing was trading was just trading the receipts instead. That's what paper currency was you accepted it as payment knowing you could always go and get the gold if you really wanted it. So they pegged the dollar to gold, at a ratio of $20 per ounce, and well that was that.  The gold standard fell apart after WW1 and WW2 because governments basically committed fraud. They printed more receipts for gold than they had actual gold, and used this counterfeit money to fund the war efforts.   So that fell apart. Bretton Woods was an attempt to sort of patch up the gold standard, while placing America in a very advantageous position. What had happened at the end of WW2 is that America was holding most of everyone's gold, because European countries had sent it to the US for safe keeping. So what the Americans did was establish the dollar as a sort of default one world currency. Every other country would measure their currency against the dollar, and the US government would peg the dollar to the gold they were holding, at a ratio of I think $40 per ounce.  And that fell apart because the US government basically committed fraud. Again. They printed more dollars than they had actual gold, so that $40 ratio did not hold and eventually in 1971 President Nixon just abolished it entirely. Since then every country has sort of pegged their currency to the dollar, but the dollar itself is pegged to nothing.  The point of a gold standard was to keep people honest. If you can legally just print all of the money you want, then you're just going to print and print and print. If anyone else does it they go to jail but it's OK when governments do it, apparently. But if there's a gold standard, it means you have one objective yard stick that we all use, and you cannot spend money you don't use.   It's a nice idea but ultimately it doesn't work because they always print more dollars than they have gold in the vaults to back it up.",

    "answer": "The mathematical constant e is referred to as representing natural growth. Unlike other popular constants like pi, e does not have a handy visual to explain it. Instead it can be thought of using banks and interest: (For true ELI5, interest means \"the bank will add 'this much' to your money at the specified time)  If we have a bank that generously offers 100% interest every year, and you give them $1, then after a year you will have $2.  But wait! A rival bank wants to offer 50% interest TWICE a year if you bank with them. At first, you may think that 50% twice = 100% once, but that isn't the case. After 6 months with this bank, your total + interest will be $1.50. Then another 6 months later it would be $2.25, getting $0.75 from 50% of the $1.50.  So it would seem that even if the % interest adds to the same 100%, getting it more often leads to giving you more money! So what about a bank that offers 25% interest every 3 months? Or 8.3% every month? How about an inconceivablely small percentage interest at every fraction of a millisecond throughout the year?  You'll find that the final amount tends toward the value of e if you were able to gain interest at a \"natural\" rate of growth.  100% once a year: $2  50% twice a year: $2.25  25% four times a year: $2.4414  8.3% twelve times a year: $2.613035  Every possible moment in a year: $2.71828 (approaching the value of e)  e is also important in Calculus and the natural log, but those are waaaay beyond a 5 year old.",

    "question": "eli5:How does sugar contribute to developing diabetes?",
    "answer": "Until someone comes with more energy to get into detail, real brief & pre-k:  Sugar (glucose is the simplest form, and the most rapidly absorbed)* hitting your bloodstream causes insulin release, a hormone made by your pancreas.  Insulin acts as the key to help glucose get into cells (they need it for energy, extra is stored for later).  If a lot of glucose hits your blood suddenly, a lot of insulin has to be released too.  But if insulin keeps pestering the cells too much, they eventually get insensitive to it, and they need more insulin to open the same amount of doors.  So whereas, before, say you needed 10 insulin for 10 glucose (made up #s) now you need 100 insulin for 10 glucose and so on, it worsens.  Your pancreas too keeps having to put out more insulin, eventually it tires out.  So at some point your cells just aren\u2019t responding to the amount of insulin you produce, there\u2019s not enough insulin to remove all that glucose from your blood, and you\u2019ve got high blood glucose (which damages organs/tissues).  You\u2019ll need drugs either to help your pancreas release/produce more insulin, or straight up need insulin injections.  *Simple sugars are bad bc they\u2019re already glucose/almost glucose.  So 50g of skittles hit your blood as glucose faster than 50g of a more complex carb which will take longer to get broken down to glucose and will thus give your pancreas more time to trickle out insulin, and your cells more time to welcome a trickle of insulin rather than a sudden onslaught, making them less likely to get intolerant.  You\u2019ll also have less glucose floating freely in your blood, causing mischief.  *Edit:* Also yeah, as someone else correctly mentioned, it\u2019s excess body fat that more directly causes diabetes to develop; you can be long-term overweight and get diabetes without having eaten a single simple sugar food in your life (although glucose still gets formed by the breakdown of your meals).  My reply\u2019s really just focused on sugar re: diabetes.  Further mistakes/omissions in my insulin resistance mechanism explanation, but eh, come PhD this if you have the energy.

I would recommend taking courses on the resonant frequency of structures, on signal theory, on physics where energy calculations are used, things like potential energy and energy flux.    If you\u2019re in college, find these courses in the syllabus. Or if you\u2019re not in STEM and don\u2019t know where to start, go to a STEM student or prof and help them find you classes where you\u2019ll learn about those things: resonant frequency, signals, energy-based physics (such as calculating the height a roller coaster will go based on potential energy instead of based on velocity and acceleration), thermodynamics, waves.    And if you\u2019re \u201cbad at math\u201d, change your self-conception and push yourself to get better. Math is about practice more than it is about talent. And math is necessary to really, truly appreciate the beauty of these ways of thinking. So make friends with math.

Does it mean your home will be undervalued by realtors when you try to sell it, or any of the myriad other forms of discrimination that black people face?  If not, then what does it mean to \"identify as black\"?  Gender is just about you. Whether you're male or female or something else is about you and nothing else, really. Your family doesn't control your gender, and neither does the government or school or your workplace.  Being black isn't really about the individual. It's about the systems. It's about the family you grew up in, the opportunities you are (or aren't) given, the way you're treated by the authorities and so on. You're black because white people decided that \"black\" is a thing, and decided on how black people should be treated by society.  Black people are not given the _option_ of choosing for themselves, of being treated the way white people are. They can't say \"please don't shoot me officer, I'm white actually\".  So should white people have the option to shop around and go cosplaying as black people (but only ever have to experience the fun parts, while preserving all the privileges you get with being white?)

So if I had black skin but I was adopted by a white family, I happen to have had good opportunities, and I live in a community where I'm treated well by the authorities, etc. would that mean I'm not black? Suppose our society treated all races equally. Would black people stop existing? Because your whole argument seems to imply that being black is defined by being treated like shit by society.  >Black people are not given the *option* of choosing for themselves, of being treated the way white people are. They can't say \"please don't shoot me officer, I'm white actually\".  Ok suppose I could actually \"pass\" as a black guy. Suppose I could alter my looks in such a way as to convince others that I'm black, just like plenty of trans women have surgeries and hormones to make them \"pass\" as women. If I could make myself look black, I'd expect a racist cop to treat me just as poorly as any other black man. So with that reasoning, if I can convincingly pass as a black man, would that make me trans black?  >Being \"transracial\" is really about white people saying \"those black people who used to be our slaves? We still own them.  A lot of people say the same about trans women. Plenty of trans people are accused of having ulterior motives. Why is it ok to assume a transracial has ulterior motives but it's wrong to question the motives of transgender people? And why are you assuming that it's just white people wanting to be black?

Launching a big expensive space station just to simulate Earth conditions would be counter productive in this setting.  There have however been a few suggestions for how to create artificial gravity by spinning up parts or the entire space station and create centrifugal forces that simulate gravity. There are however issues such as possible oscillations, how to dock with such a space station, how to interface rotating and stationary components, etc.  In fact there was a big centrifuge module constructed for the ISS. The purpose was to be able to simulate Lunar or Mars gravity for research programs, test out designs for centrifugal space stations, conduct control experiments in space, and so on. But due to issues with balancing such a huge rotating mass inside a fragile space station it was limited in size and was not big enough for humans, only rodents and plants. Sadly due to issues with funding and delays in the construction of ISS this module was parked in a parking lot in Japan and have not moved in over twenty years.  There is currently some suggestions for one of research missions with the new cheaper spacecraft that have come on the market the last decade. The plans usually involves tying a long tether between the spacecraft and the upper stage booster that put it in orbit.

    "answer": "The name of the phenomenon is the supercritical to subcritical transition.  Basically, in the first flat-ish part, the water that just hit the sink is going faster that a wave can travel in water. As the water slows down, the way it flows changes and that gives this distinct profile.  The transition is called a hydraulic jump and happens because of fluids dynamics (a fancy way to say \"basically, that's how liquids behave\")",

It radiates in all visible colors. And indeed, astronomers have done this, and that is what we see.  But we live on Earth. At the bottom of an ocean of air. That air messes with the light as it passes through.  Have you ever wondered why the sky is blue? Air particles like to scatter light. Knock it off its direct path and send it careening off in a new random direction. But it likes to do this to bluish light more than the other colors. That bluish light that gets knocked off course  in random parts of the sky may be sent on a path that hits your eye. Since that is how you detect blue things, the sky looks blue.  That blue light had to come from somewhere, though. Direct sunlight going into your eye has this happening to it, too. But instead of light going a random direction having the bluish parts knocked in your direction, we have the opposite. Direct sunlight is having the bluish colors knocked away. The light that finally reaches you will be slightly blue light depleted, making the sun appear somewhat yellowish.  At sunrise and sunset, the sun is clipping your part of the earth at a low angle, meaning its light has to pass through way more air. This depletes the blue light even more, to the point where the sun becomes orange, then red. The sky around it stirs that color together with the blue to create those stunning pinks and fuchsias.

So a bottle is sitting there with almost no oxygen and no living germs - it can last for a long time without going bad.   But as soon as you open the seal, you allow air in and air has oxygen and germs floating around, so the sauce might go bad in a few days. If you put it in the fridge, the cold makes the germs slow down a lot, so they don't eat up the sauce and they don't make new germs as fast.

Remember, they still have other properties to sell and they don't want you to trash your house and prevent them from getting a good deal selling the other homes. Eventually the builder will sell all the properties and the contract you signed gets handed off into a HOA made up of the owners of the various properties.  Eventually, anyone you sell your home to will have to sign the same contract as part of the purchase of the home.

    "answer": "There are two ways you can write up the netcode for a game. You can either handle the button presses when they were originally pressed, or you can handle them when they get to the central server.  Let's say you're starting with the central server timing. This is also referred to as Delay-Based. If you press a button on your screen, until you receive an acknowledgement from the server that the button was pressed, nothing happens. This creates a lag that you have to overcome that just isn't present with in-person gaming, and is going to vary greatly depending on your connection at the time. However, everything you see on your screen is guaranteed to be what actually happens.  The other way, handling buttons based on when they were originally pushed, is what is referred to as rollback.  Imagine each button press gets sent to the server with a timestamp. Your local game can start playing the actions right away, because it expects that the server will accept that button press at that time.  When it gets to the server, it will look at the timestamp of the button press. If it has already done any calculations for any button presses later than that, then it rolls back those button presses, adds the new one, and then replays them, and sends the correction to both clients.  This means that you effectively always get your button press at the time you pressed it, without weird lag making it much later than you intended. This also means that, if there is substantial lag, you can see the game stutter as it corrects itself, but if there is very little lag, then everything appears very smooth for both players, making them feel as if it's a local game.",

    "answer": "A seed box is a dedicated device for torrenting. These are typically VM's on a managed server.  There are a few reasons to use a seedbox, but in general...  1. They hide your identity when torrenting. Normally, anyone else accessing the same torrent can get your IP, and that can lead to a chain of events with you being charged for distributing illegal goods.  2. They have dedicated connections with strong upload speeds. This means that you can download stuff quickly, as well as upload. This helps maintain your ratio (how much you upload for how much you download) which is needed for many private torrent sites.  3. You can download torrents immediately, and then download the files within them at your leisure. This is useful for setting up automated downloads. You download things immediately when they become available, and later grab the file when you want it.  Beyond that, there are some seedbox services where users actually keep the raw files on the seedbox and stream their content off of them as they please. You might setup a Plex server on the seedbox that you then stream the stuff you have downloaded off of and on your personal device. You never have to download a local copy of the file, so there's nothing to manage at home aside from your streaming app.",

    "answer": "Let me try and explain the European club football pyramid:  First, the most important point: All professional football teams in Europe play under the same umbrella, that is called UEFA. UEFA runs the highest club competition in Europe, called the UEFA Champions League, whose winner is the European champion. The teams that will play in any given year's Champions League are the previous year's winners of the national leagues of European nations.  Oh, yes, the national leagues: Parallel to the Champions League, every nation also has its own leagues. England has its own, called the Premier League, my country Turkey has the S\u00fcper Lig, etc. The qualification process varies by country depending on that country's teams' previous performance, but by winning the national league, any team in any given European country could go and get to play in the Champions League, and win it and become the European champions if they are good enough.  Each nation has lower divisions of their leagues too, but those divisions are all interconnected with the top division. At the end of each season, the top teams in lower divisions switch places with the bottom teams in the higher division, a process known as 'promotion and relegation'. This ensures that, if I and a bunch of my friends decided to form a team in our Turkish town tomorrow, after enough victories in the following years, we could theoretically get promoted to the Turkish S\u00fcper Lig, win that, go to the Champions League, win that, and become the European champions. Improbable, sure, but theoretically not impossible. By winning enough games for a long enough time, any team could win the Champions League.  Every other continent also has a similar system to determine their continental champion. Every year, the winners from all 6 continents play in the  FIFA Club World Cup. The winner is crowned the world champion.  Now these 12 rich teams owned by bastards have decided to bypass this whole system by creating their own league in place of the Champions League. They seem to like the American system of 'closed league', where the owners of teams decide who gets to play, where even after years of horrendous performance you just continue to be part of the competition, where new teams (which are referred to as 'franchises', ugh) have to ask for permission from the league to be part of it.  This would make the entirety of European leagues pointless. Sure, the national leagues would continue to exist, but with no way of joining this 'Super League' besides invitation, and no way for the 'founding clubs' to ever not qualify for it, pretty much all the excitement of European football is being stolen.",

Epinephrine (also called adrenaline) is a very important neurotransmitter, and that's also what's in EpiPens. But this doesn't always work for a few reasons.  First, a lot of those chemicals can't easily get from our blood into our brain tissue (or vice versa) since there's a protective barrier. Even the dopamine pump above uses a modified version of dopamine that can, but we can't always do that well.  Second, when you dump a bunch of hormones or chemicals on the body the body reacts by making less of that hormone itself to try to keep itself in balance. This can sometimes cause serious side effects.  Third, very very few problems in the brain are due to a simple issue of \"not enough of a single chemical\" (even Parkinson's, which is basically caused by the brain not being able to make dopamine anymore, is more complicated) You don't water plants in your house with a fire hose because the water that's really good for the plants isn't so great for your computer on the desk next to them.

For example, I'm a programmer who works in the insurance industry. I've worked in it for over 15 years and I understand a lot about how insurance and insurance systems work, but every different insurance company I work for has a different way of running their business.  So, the business know how their business runs, but don't know how to build/program systems, and I know how to build/program systems, but don't fully understand the business.  This is where a Business Analyst (BA) comes in. It's their job to understand how the business works, and help extract the requirements that the business needs for their IT system. The BA then helps 'translate' those requirements into a form (usually called use cases or user stories) that programmers can understand in order to implement. BA's can also help testers define their test cases around the same use cases/user stories so that the features can be properly tested to ensure they meet the business' requirements.  That's only part of a BA's role, they can also do work to analyse and improve business processes, help with documentation and various other tasks, but this is the main interaction with IT/programmers that I think you're looking for.

In a diesel engine, though, even if you let off the gas pedal, the engine will still draw a full charge of air into the cylinders, and that air acts as a spring; because the engine is still turning, it's still compressing the air, and the air then rebounds when the piston falls back down.

    "answer": "A naked short is an illegal practice in which an institution borrows a share of a stock and shorts it, except the share has not been determined to exist.   For example, say there are 1 million shares of a company. A normal short would be borrowing 100 shares and paying a premium to open a contract giving you the right to sell those shares at a price (the strike price) regardless of what the price is. This means if the stock goes down you can sell it for more than its worth. A naked short, is borrowing shares that aren\u2019t determined to exist. This means if there are 1 million shares, and someone\u2019s buys short contracts worth more shares than what exist in the market, it\u2019s artificial.   This is illegal because it creates an artificial market with non existent shares and mostly undermines the whole system. However this is a common practice by many financial institutions such as hedge funds (citadel for example).   As for what happened on CNBC, an anchor woman actually called what the current hedge funds and market participants naked shorting, in reference to AMC and GameStop stock. This is significant because naked shorting is illegal. So a trusted financial news source like CNBC on air saying it\u2019s naked shorting is validating the reason why many people are buying and holding shares of company\u2019s like AMC and GameStop.

    "answer": "I'd google this to get a picture displaying it, helps to be able to visualize it. Also easier to think about one piston of a four stroke engine.   The crankshaft turns, pulling the connecting rod and piston down the cylinder and the valves on the intake side, fresh air open. The piston moving down the cylinder pulls air into the cylinder.   At the bottom of stroke, the intake valves close, and the piston moves up the cylinder compressing the air it pulled in. In a gas engine the file is sprayed or diffused into the air as it's pulled into the cylinder, in a diesel the fuel is sprayed in when the cylinder is about the top of stroke and the air is compressed. In a gasoline engine you add a spark from a sparkplug, to ignite the gas vapor. In a diesel the heat from compressing the air is enough to ignite the fuel vapor in the cylinder.   Once you light the fuel on fire, it explodes, forcing the piston back down, turning the crankshaft.   As the piston reaches the end of stroke another set of valves in the cylinder head open, these are exhaust valves. They are basically connected to the tail pipe. The piston comes back up, forcing the burn air out of the exhaust side. Near the top of stroke the intake valves open, this let's more exhaust blow out of the cylinder. Then the exhaust valves close and you're back at the start.   You add more cylinders doing the same thing at different times, so that it has more smooth power instead of all of them firing at once. That keeps the crankshaft spinning. You attach a flywheel to the back that is heavy and it will keep momentum going once it's spinning, smoothing out the operation even more. Then you attach whatever you want to run to it.   Can go into more detail or a single component of you want. But that's the basics of it.",

    "question": "ELI5 Could someone explain to me the Gold standard, how it came to an end and the Bretton Woods System. Also if the value of dollar is tied to value of gold what's the point?",
    "answer": "When you deposited gold in a bank, they would give you a receipt. Trading actual gold coins is difficult, because they're heavy, it's hard to make change etc. so what people started doing was trading was just trading the receipts instead. That's what paper currency was you accepted it as payment knowing you could always go and get the gold if you really wanted it. So they pegged the dollar to gold, at a ratio of $20 per ounce, and well that was that.  The gold standard fell apart after WW1 and WW2 because governments basically committed fraud. They printed more receipts for gold than they had actual gold, and used this counterfeit money to fund the war efforts.   So that fell apart. Bretton Woods was an attempt to sort of patch up the gold standard, while placing America in a very advantageous position. What had happened at the end of WW2 is that America was holding most of everyone's gold, because European countries had sent it to the US for safe keeping. So what the Americans did was establish the dollar as a sort of default one world currency. Every other country would measure their currency against the dollar, and the US government would peg the dollar to the gold they were holding, at a ratio of I think $40 per ounce.  And that fell apart because the US government basically committed fraud. Again. They printed more dollars than they had actual gold, so that $40 ratio did not hold and eventually in 1971 President Nixon just abolished it entirely. Since then every country has sort of pegged their currency to the dollar, but the dollar itself is pegged to nothing.  The point of a gold standard was to keep people honest. If you can legally just print all of the money you want, then you're just going to print and print and print. If anyone else does it they go to jail but it's OK when governments do it, apparently. But if there's a gold standard, it means you have one objective yard stick that we all use, and you cannot spend money you don't use.   It's a nice idea but ultimately it doesn't work because they always print more dollars than they have gold in the vaults to back it up.",

    "answer": "Yes and no. Both a dancer and a karate-ka are very good at how they move their body and generating the required forces. However, it is their foundations that differ. A karate-ka will spend hours training how to block, strike, and kick, whereas a dancer spends hours training different moves (I'm not a dancer, my sister was, I can't name any of the things she did lol).  Both get to be good at moving their body and memorizing patterns of moves, and a good dancer could become a good at kata and vice versa, but they need the other training too. A dancer couldn't just learn the kata and be able to execute it the same.  I have world medals for kata and my sister has national medals for ballroom dance. No way could I dance like her if she taught me the moves (trust me, we tried!). And she can't do kata like I can. But with a lot of training, it would require less effort for each of us to get better at the other's sport because we understand how to move our bodies more than someone who doesn't do a sport like that.",

So on the west side of the oceans, it brings warm water up the east coast from farther south, passes by the Arctic ocean up north and brings cold water down the east side of the ocean. So that's why the west coast of the US gets cold water (from the Arctic) and the east coast gets warm water (from the southern waters). And the warm water is more likely to breed large storms.

Fusing all of the elements within a human into iron would indeed create a huge blast, but there is no real way to do such a thing.

In ear headphones actually put out less energy, but that energy output is much closer to the ear, making it sound equivalent to over ear headphones that might be putting out more energy, but are further away from the ear.

However you do not need anything to transfer thermal energy. Although not as efficient hot things will emit thermal radiation which will heat up objects around it. This is how the heat from the sun is transferred through empty space to Earth and how the heat from a fire can warm you even though the air goes up into the air. And we can measure how much energy comes from each direction and therefore get a temperature of everything. And it turns out the universe is pretty cold. But it will take a long time for someone to cool down to this temperature.

    "question": "ELI5: Why do public infrastructure projects very often run behind schedule and over budget all around the world?",
    "answer": "As a reformed project manager (not civil): unlike in some fields like maybe software, or in infrastructure projects where more of the entire project is _entirely_ under you control (say in building an airport or erecting a new chemical refinery), civil projects have SOOO many pieces going on. And quite a few of them are NOT under your control.   If you work for BP and you're building a new refinery, you've done your environmental compliance assessment, you've lined up your contractors years in advance, you own the land and you don't care about the interruption to your other facilities - you've already dealt with it to as to not interrupt. And if your workers have to go the long way around, well, you're just paying them overtime. THe only one affected is you/your corporation.   Civil projects: well you gotta have public consultations, you have to re-route utilities, redirect traffic, do site work and thousands of other things _before you sink a shovel_. AND, all the things to reverse this are scheduled to happen AFTER the bridge is done. If ANYTHING goes wrong with the actual bridge building, everything gets thrown for a loop. Bus line 207 got re-routed but was scheduled to resume over the bridge next week? The re-route requires six additional bussess per shift, that's six extra drivers, six extra busses. They're needed to backfill the south boulevard re-route because of the new sewer on Ocean st. in a week. If the bridge project takes longer now I need six MORE buses and drivers. Oh and you have no direct control over this, this is the transit planner and they don't like you by the way.   So, you can mitigate a lot of these by having contingnecy plans. But those require resources to be reserved and allocated all of which costs money. I can plan you a project that comes in on schedule but if it has to be able to absorb any and all possibilities itll cost you - you probably won't like it.   A good example: my city was laying a railway underpass. Every day the rail line was disrupted cost the city $XXXXXX.  They're pouring concrete in Febuary... in Canada. The weather was forecast to be good for _that particular week_, but below a certain temperature concrete doesn't set right or it cracks or something (I dunno, Im not civil). So to protect the pour they threw up a big heated tent large enough for the machines and shotcrete trucks. Cost like $1.2M. Oh my god did the peons have a field day with _that_. Never mind that had the bridge not been completed on time (and if the concrete doesn't pour correctly you have to do it over. All of it.) the city would have been paying the railway like $100k per day or more. So $1.2M to protect against what could have been much more than that... seems like a deal to me.   So yeah. Civil projects are a balance between cost and what the city can afford, minimizing interactions with other government departments, minimizing disruption to people, business and traffic. There's lots of communication and inter-dependency and if _anything_ goes wrong (heaven forbid your archeology survey didn't catch an indigenous burial ground) everything else falls apart or falls into some very expensive contingency plans.",
    "follow-up": "unlike in some fields like maybe software,  LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE, BUDDY...  My team, supporting a software product, were going to move on to a new facet of developing said product. ALL WE HAD TO DO, was one small task of automating the build and release pipeline, called Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). We already have these pipelines in place for other facets of our product, all we had to do was clone any one of them and change the variables.  That was over a year ago. I've scarcely written a line of real product code in that amount of time. These automated tools are supposed to help us, make the process easier. Over. A. Year. I can run the commands manually on my workstation and produce the product from scratch in 3 minutes, 25 seconds. Our pipelines take ~6 hours to run, and we've never gotten them to run stable, they always fail.  I've got a guy who is in a dev/ops role. Took him over 8 months to get approved the hardware he spec'd for the job. He just needed the guy to look at the sheet and say yes. Once he got the hardware, he had to hand it over to another team who would do a custom install. That was 6 months ago. Just install the fucking software. My guy bought a mouse jiggler to \"stay active\" at work. There is no amount of shouting he can do to change things, this is how they've operated for over the last decade. They know it's a problem. These are things he's in no position to do himself.  Also in my experience, I've worked at places where sales are pushing me hard for an answer of \"when is it going to be ready?\" I never give an answer besides, \"It's done when it's done. And when it's done, you'll know.\" So they come back, \"So like 3 weeks?\" No, man, no. So then they go and tell the client 3 weeks. That day comes, and the work ain't done. Often we're dealing with massively complex code bases. I've worked on the dumbest shit that was hundreds of millions of lines of code - principally because it's just so poorly constructed. I had a junior reproduce the functionality of a product completely, including all future plans for the product, in 2 weeks during his lunch break. He rewrote the whole thing in Python. Everyone got fired for that. I told them for 5 years the code base was so bad, that would happen. No one listens to me... Anyway, sales guy comes back and says \"Where is it? You said 3 weeks.\" NO, MOTHERFUCKER, YOU SAID THREE WEEKS. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT YOU HAVE TO TELL THE CLIENT. It's like opening a can of worms. The complexity is such that you've got to figure out how to patch in the change without breaking everything else, it's not trivial, and you can't \"just change it\". Otherwise, I would have rewritten that one app in 2 weeks and NOT see our entire team fired for it...  So much spit and glue, man. No software is on time. Ever. People start writing code before they have any idea what they're aiming for. Requirements change continually, so software is always an evolution, not a targeted, well defined product.  It's no surprise to me at all that Boeing had software problems with their new airplanes that killed people. What surprises me unto no end is that this doesn't happen more often. Interlocks on MRI and x-ray machines... All sorts of life support and safety systems that are controlled by software. I don't personally know a single developer, not one colleague across my whole career, who owns a Nest, or a Ring, or any sort of smart device. You know why? Because you don't have to boot a mercury switch. Your analog thermostat will never crash. An analog thermostat will never fail, and it'll be the last one you buy for that house.  I can't believe how much blind faith society puts into software. I tell juniors all the time, we're not incentivized to write good software, no one is interested in running this software 100 years from now. It only has to be good enough to keep the money coming - whatever that might take, and the bar is as low as it can be, because better is just a waste of money."

    "answer": "Firstly the main purpose of a space station is to do microgravity research. Launching a big expensive space station just to simulate Earth conditions would be counter productive in this setting.  There have however been a few suggestions for how to create artificial gravity by spinning up parts or the entire space station and create centrifugal forces that simulate gravity. There are however issues such as possible oscillations, how to dock with such a space station, how to interface rotating and stationary components, etc.  In fact there was a big centrifuge module constructed for the ISS. The purpose was to be able to simulate Lunar or Mars gravity for research programs, test out designs for centrifugal space stations, conduct control experiments in space, and so on. But due to issues with balancing such a huge rotating mass inside a fragile space station it was limited in size and was not big enough for humans, only rodents and plants. Sadly due to issues with funding and delays in the construction of ISS this module was parked in a parking lot in Japan and have not moved in over twenty years.  There is currently some suggestions for one of research missions with the new cheaper spacecraft that have come on the market the last decade. The plans usually involves tying a long tether between the spacecraft and the upper stage booster that put it in orbit. This configuration could then be spun up using the thrusters and therefore generating a nice stable simulated gravity at very low cost. This could be used for low gravity research, something we currently are unable to do, or even to create gravity for transit missions to Mars.",

    "answer": "Here's what happens: Chemically pure water doesn't conduct electricity by itself, deionized and distilled water are very poor conductors as well due to the very low electrolyte (mostly salts) concentration. So when you put a pair of electrodes in a cup containing some pure water or deionized water and try to let an electrical current flow, nothing happens. But then again, every day water is not chemically pure nor deionized (and there's no in-home system capable of obtaining that and there's no point in doing that).  If you were to add let's say table salt into the former system, then it would become an electrolytic cell, and chemical reactions would take place into the electrodes; specifically a reduction in the cathode and an oxidation on the anode. This is the point where the scam gets in action: the electrodes in the cell are made from metals, commonly aluminum and copper, copper gets oxidized because of it's reduction potential, therefore forming copper ions in solution.   There are many other reactions that could occur depending on the salts naturally dissolved in water, and all those reactions cross-react with copper ions (and any other harmless ions that might be in drinking water), forming a very chemically-diverse precipitate with a dark foul-color; giving the false idea that the tap water is filthy and unsafe, when in truth the electrodes are to blame.  On a side note, if both electrodes were made from platinum (a very chemically stable metal) you wouldn't see anything but a bubbling indicating water electrolysis into pure hydrogen and oxygen, no foul colors, no anything, because platinum won't oxidize in that setup.  In conclusion, as you already noted it, it's only a ruse to scare people into buying something.",

But what did happen was the Russian military had exercises a couple hundred miles away, on their own territory. Yet we have military exercises near Russian borders all the time.

There's not really one singular definition for \"processed\" that everyone can agree on, so it can be really hard to say that it does or doesn't have a direct health impact.   That said, three of the things that a lot of processed foods have in common is that they are easy to get, easy to prep, and easy to eat a lot of. They stay stable on store and warehouse shelves for longer, so they tend to be cheaper and in stock more often. A lot of the challenging prep work like the gardening, cutting, and cooking are done for you, making it easy. They also tend to have a lot of the extra food removed during the manufacturing process, so they are more calorie dense per bite.   Sugar is the big deal in my opinion. We consume so much more sugar these days than we used too. Candy, soda, sugar filled \"low fat\" options, \"health foods\" like granola that are packed with sugar, etc...

    "question": "ELI5: For many animals, the act of sex is over in mere seconds. Why do humans (generally) take many minutes to ejaculate?",
    "answer": "Most mammals aren't finished in seconds, they often do take several minutes. From a biological perspective you don't want to cum TOO quickly because there is a strong chance of wasting it while not actually having sex, or ejaculating before penetration, so most mammals are a minute or two at minimum.  Then there is a popular theory that the shape of the penis is supposed to work as a shovel to help remove the sperm of a females previous partner. This would indicate that the initial portion for sex in humans at least is to help remove rival males sperm from the female. If the shovel theory is even partially correct than it would seem reasonable that an extended period of sex would increase the likelihood of passing down those traits.  This does hold some merit when you compare the sex durations of gorillas, who have a very strict hierarchy so competition for females isn't based on sex, resulting in the smallest penises of any primate and only around 1.5minutes of sex on average.  With that said, Bonobos, our closest living relatives and the most sexual of any primates only last about 10-15 seconds and have similar penises to ours. This might be because they are so focused on sex though that if they were to last longer they would end up prey, and not pass down their genes.",

    "answer": "To add,  9,192,631,770 is a *very specific number*... How did we get to that? It's a long and fascinating history how we have tried to define units of measure. At first, they were arbitrary, then people bumped into problems. Like, the foot - presume our feet are different lengths... I can go even earlier with the cubit, supposedly the length from your elbow to your finger tip. Can you see a problem here?  So the second was first a division of a day. Then it was a fraction of a solar day. Then it was defined by a fraction of a year, because our orbit around the sun is more stable than our rotation about our axis. A lot changed starting in the 1940s with the quartz clock.  But the thing is, we had, for a long, long time, a pretty much agreed upon definition for what a second was, if not imperfect. So if you're going to invent an atomic clock, or any device that is really, really accurate at counting divisions of time, then you're going to want to fit it to peoples expectations. They back-fit the definition to what was approximately a second, since a second prior was always approximate anyway.  But it's really hard to define a \"base\" unit of time. What is the smallest unit of time that there can be? The smallest unit of time that can be measured? We don't actually know. We have concepts of smallest units, called Planck units of distance and time, but they keep getting smaller every few years, we haven't found the floor yet.

    "answer": "It's important to try be as consistent as possible with using the correct oil for your engine. Selecting the right oil for your car will impact your fuel efficiency - it might only be a 1% efficiency gain but over the lifetime of your car that can add up. Also the right oil will protect your engine and potentially add years to an engine's life.  Synthetic is normally a thinner oil and most new cars run comfortably on synthetic - the only real exception is Japanese cars - most Toyotas etc. have pretty much idiot proof engines and are happy running semi-synthetics.   Older cars - I'm talking older than 20 years - can exhibit problems when running on synthetics because the older engines can be pretty leaky and the thinner synthetic oil leaks out quicker.  But oils can be mixed - it's not a problem especially if it's only a top up - it's far more important that you don't over fill or under fill your engine oil. You must also check the engine oil level when then engine is warmed up already - if you're checking it cold you are not getting an accurate level.

    "question": "ELI5: Why are v8 engines over 5 liters in size common but i4 engines over 2.5 liters are very uncommon?",
    "answer": "I4 engines have excellent Primary Balance characteristics, meaning vibration due to the up-down motion of the pistons cancels each other out. It's easy to see why this works in animations of such engines.  However i4 engines have unusually poor *Second-Order Balance.*   Second-Order balance, also called secondary balance is related to the inevitable side-to-side rocking motion of the connecting rods. This motion causes the center of mass of the connecting rod to not move perfectly in sync with the CM of the piston. Rather, the connecting rod CM moves closer to the top surface of piston by a few mm, at the middle of the stroke then back again at bottom and top dead center. The term \"Second Order\" refers to the fact that this vibration occurs two times per revolution of the crankshaft.   What's worse, in an i4 these vibrations are perfectly in phase with each other with all 4 cylinders.  The fewest number of cylinders you can have and still have good secondary balance is 6.  I6 engines are inherently very well balanced. This is why many large heavily turbocharged diesel engines use this configuration.   At higher engine speed second-order forces grow in relation to the *square* of the crankshaft RPM, rather than in a linear fashion. This means that if you double the RPM the secondary vibration grows by 4x, and if you triple the RPM the vibration grows by 9x. So it's easy to see that this could lead to catastrophic engine failure to the tune of throwing a connecting rod in an i4.  To counteract this ~~almost all~~ (EDIT: *the majority of*) i4 engines have balancing shafts with counterweights that rotate at twice the engine RPM to prevent the engine from shaking itself off the engine mounts above, say, 2500RPM. Indeed most engines with less than 6 cylinders have balancing shafts of some type. This is far from a perfect solution with i4's since this still produces additional forces on the engine block between the crankshaft and balancer bearings that are less than desirable. The balancer shafts consume power themselves and result in higher vibration at idle speed. Their inertia reduces engine revving.   This brings us to the other prescription for the secondary balance problem, which is to reduce the engine redline. It's hard to get around this second part.   So, above 2.8L or so, you end up with a  Law-of -Diminishing-Returns relationship where larger and larger cylinders necessitate heavier connecting rods that cause greater and greater secondary vibration. This means you need to reduce the engine operating speed while using an increasingly heavy balancing shaft that consumes more power, causes more idle vibration, and induces more forces into the engine block between it's own bearings and the crankshaft main bearing. Thus, necessitating a thicker, heavier crankshaft and engine block. Beyond a certain point the fact that you're invariably forced to reduce the redline and increase engine weight in a way that's disproportionate to the displacement, wipes out any additional power you'd gain by increasing the cylinder size. Say, above about 3.5L  A V-8 deals with the secondary balance problem by operating each bank 90\u00b0 out of phase to each other, so that second-order forces in each bank tend to cancel each other instead of adding together constructively. However V-8s often use balancer shafts to counteract high RPM vibrations. The same can be much smaller on V-8 with respect to displacement, a V-8 with 6L does not need a balance shaft twice as large as an i4 with 3L. In fact a smaller one can be used in the former V8.  In V-6 engines there is good second order balance, but you have a moderate issue with primary balance.  A three cylinder engine does not have the outstanding primary balance of an i4, but it is better than a single cylinder. Specifically, in an i3 the uo and down monitions of the pistons to not always perfectly counteract each other. In a V6, unbalanced primary forces can be made to counteract each other best using a 60\u00b0 angle, but this does not entirely eliminate them. So V-6s have primary balance that is not quite a good as V-8's and they vibrate more. Again the usual solution is to reduce the redline RPM. Balancer shafts are also common on v6's  Another solution to the secondary balance problem is the one used by Karl Frederich Benz. He and his company produced the first flat-four opposed piston engine in 1900, using a boxer configuration that should ne familiar to fans of subaru, Porche, or VW cars.   These engines were used in Benz's racing cars, they had 5.4 liters and produced 20 HP, which was excellent at the time. The engines did not need balancer shafts at all and operated much more smoothly than the engines of Benz's competitors.  So why aren't flat-four boxer engines used on most cars? Well because they're significantly more difficult to produce and precision-assemble, and create a number of other less than obvious technical problems.",

Arthritis pain: when the OTC pain killers don't cut it, other NSAIDs such as meloxicam (Mobic) or celecoxib (Celebrex) can be used. Easier on the stomach, harder on the heart.  More intense pain: injectable NSAIDs like ketorolac (Toradol) (really hard on kidneys) or opioids.   Nerve pain: not many great options, but gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), and a class of antidepressants called SNRIs (duloxetine and venlafaxine are the parent molecules) can be used.

England has its own, called the Premier League, my country Turkey has the S\u00fcper Lig, etc. The qualification process varies by country depending on that country's teams' previous performance, but by winning the national league, any team in any given European country could go and get to play in the Champions League, and win it and become the European champions if they are good enough.  Each nation has lower divisions of their leagues too, but those divisions are all interconnected with the top division. At the end of each season, the top teams in lower divisions switch places with the bottom teams in the higher division, a process known as 'promotion and relegation'. This ensures that, if I and a bunch of my friends decided to form a team in our Turkish town tomorrow, after enough victories in the following years, we could theoretically get promoted to the Turkish S\u00fcper Lig, win that, go to the Champions League, win that, and become the European champions. Improbable, sure, but theoretically not impossible. By winning enough games for a long enough time, any team could win the Champions League.  Every other continent also has a similar system to determine their continental champion. Every year, the winners from all 6 continents play in the  FIFA Club World Cup. The winner is crowned the world champion.  Now these 12 rich teams owned by bastards have decided to bypass this whole system by creating their own league in place of the Champions League. They seem to like the American system of 'closed league', where the owners of teams decide who gets to play, where even after years of horrendous performance you just continue to be part of the competition, where new teams (which are referred to as 'franchises', ugh) have to ask for permission from the league to be part of it.  This would make the entirety of European leagues pointless. Sure, the national leagues would continue to exist, but with no way of joining this 'Super League' besides invitation, and no way for the 'founding clubs' to ever not qualify for it, pretty much all the excitement of European football is being stolen.",

India would need to convert Rupees into Euros to pay for the planes, and if the overall trend is more demand to convert Rupees into Euros then the Rupee would weaken against the Euro -- those willing to accept them would demand more for same number of Euros.

    "answer": "The universe is not infinite in size.  The universe has a finite volume, there are just no \\*edges\\* to that volume.  If that seems weird, it's probably because you're thinking of the Universe embedded in a familiar 3 dimensional geometry, like a box you hold in your hands.  The \\*edges\\* are where objects in a familiar 3D geometry expand \\*into\\* something - but that's not what's happening in our Universe (as described by General Relativity).  It's hard to imagine, but that familiar 3D geometry is wrong, when describing the Universe.  Instead, think of the universe as the 3-dimensional analogue, to the 2-dimensional surface of a balloon.  If you are an ant on that 2D surface (like we are, in the 3D volume of the universe) then your perception is that the surface area is finite in size, but it \\*has no edges\\* - in exactly the same way our Universe is finite in size, but has no edges.  Let's say someone takes the ant's balloon, and starts blowing it up even more.   The ant will notice that the surface area is increasing - even though it has no edges.  The ant might ask \"But what is it increasing \\*into\\*?\"   And it's not increasing \\*into\\* anything -- it's just that when you blow a balloon up, the radius increases (let's call this radius \"the metric\") and that causes the surface area of the balloon to increase, too.  That's what's happening to our Universe.  There is a metric, it is increasing, and it causes the finite 3D volume of the universe to increase, without edges to this universe.",

    "answer": "An engine does not have infinite power or rev ability. It requires more effort to accelerate than to cruise. Lower gears mean that the engine is turning more times (more power) for every time the wheel turns. This gives it the extra oomph to accelerate. But the engine can only rev so high, so more gears are needed to go faster. As you go faster the gear ratio changes meaning the engine is turning less times for every rev of the wheel. This creates efficiency at high cruising speeds for better gas mileage. It only takes about 15 horsepower to keep a car going at speed, while it takes many more ponies to get up to that speed. All that being said, there is a style of transmission known as a continuously variable transmission, which doesn't change gears so much as smoothly changes the ratio as needed while driving, resulting in a smooth acceleration without changing individual gears.",

    "answer": "Your sinuses (what your nostrils feed into and then into your trachea and lungs) isn't one big cavity. [It's actually 4 different chambers](https://breathefreely.com/pasha-chamber-of-sinuses/) (2 for each nostril) for the majority of the population (there's an estimated 10% of the population that have 6 sinus chambers/3 per nostril).  So the short and simple of it is that any of the 4 chambers could be inflamed at any given time causing the 'stuffy nose' symptom in one or both nostrils. But, your body is pretty good about making sure you keep breathing (unless you have sleep apnea) so it regulates the erectile tissue in each side of your sinus to usually make sure you can breath out of one of them.   To get a little deeper into it, the process of warming and humidifying the air you're breathing into your lungs through your nose is energy and resource intensive so your body only sends the extra blood to one nostril at a time. But this extra blood causes the tissue to swell (kind of like when you injure your skin and the area around it swells because of the increased blood flow to the injury) and when you're sick you already have increased blood flow to the infection in your sinuses and this increases the stuffiness on the side your body is trying to regulate the air quality in.

    "answer": "Good question! Let's think of momentum as the idea a moving object has energy it can transfer to another moving object through a collision. For things with mass, one object speeds up and the other slows down after a collision (or their velocities change, to be more accurate).  With light, we see that light can hit an object with mass, change its velocity, and the deflected light will be red-shifted (indicating it lost energy). If we look at the system as a whole, the change in the momentum of the deflected object will match the energy lost by the photon. By our momentum definition, that means the photon had momentum and then transferred it to the object!  More generally, we can describe momentum due to an objects mass (p = mv) and momentum (energy) due to its wave-character (p = h/lambda or hf/c [since lambda = c/f]). All matter has wave character (as described by its de Broglie wavelength), but for massive objects, the wavelength tends to be so large it's unobservable and the contribution to momentum basically rounds to zero (especially next to the large momentum of an object with mass).   Usually we worry about this \"dual character\" with electrons, which have both mass and wave-like characteristics and we need this relativistic explanation of momentum to better understand their behavior.  This idea that light has momentum is how solar sails work.

    "answer": "Spiders don't think, they're just the result of millions of years of spiders with the best habits having the best chance of reproduction. For wheel web spiders, the basic concept is pretty simple really.  Flying insects essentially ride airstreams like a surfer rides waves. That means the best place for a web is across some sort of airflow.  Luckily there's a really easy way to achieve that. The spider starts by letting out an initial guideline in the draft until the airflow picks it up and the end of the line sticks somewhere. When that happens the spider will cut the end of the line it was letting out and attach it where it's sitting. Presto, the spider now has a line crossing a gap.  Now the spider just has to cross that line to create a number of spokes and then create the connecting lines between the spokes.  Spiders can do this pretty quickly really. A very productive web will be repaired and cleaned but an unproductive web will often just be abandoned if it breaks or clutters up. This means that every night, a lot of spiders are trying their luck by building a web someplace new. Most spiderwebs last a few days at best.  And while spiders had millions of years to evolve these clever webs from humble beginnings, the first bicycle appeared only 204 years ago.

The problem with the diamond rain is that it's theoretical. The presence of it depends on how convective the lower atmosphere and oceans are.  If they're highly convective then the diamonds will mix with oxygen and burn to create Co2. Eventually, all the carbon will be burned this way and there'll be no diamond rain.  If they're more evenly layered, or if a thick layer of hot gas is preventing the liquid ocean from coming into contact with the molten surface, then the diamonds will fall into the lava and boil away without getting the chance to bond with any oxygen.

There's not really one singular definition for \"processed\" that everyone can agree on, so it can be really hard to say that it does or doesn't have a direct health impact.

They stay stable on store and warehouse shelves for longer, so they tend to be cheaper and in stock more often. A lot of the challenging prep work like the gardening, cutting, and cooking are done for you, making it easy. They also tend to have a lot of the extra food removed during the manufacturing process, so they are more calorie dense per bite.   Sugar is the big deal in my opinion.

    "question": "ELI5: If solar panels can be put on the roof of a house into a battery for electricity, why cant/dont car manufacturers like tesla put it on the top of cars to have unlimited range?",
    "answer": "That is basically an age-old battle between power generation and power consumption.  For solar energy you need space and sun. Lots of it actually, and while in some countries the weather pattern is enough for solar generation, in many countries solar energy on a private site like a normal house can only supply X percentage of your daily / yearly consumption. This is of course still a major benefit, hence more and more buildings incorporate some kind of regenerative system (even only to reduce normal energy costs by a few percent).  For cars however this is a bit problematic, as the space on a car roof is simply way too small to generate energy to generate enough energy efficiently enough to power batteries ... not even considering tunnels, bad weather, being in a garage or roofed parking lot, inside the shadows of skyscrapers in a city or a forest etc. You can optimize your solar energy generation at your home. You cannot do that nearly as good for a car.  Now in theory they can at least supply a bit of energy, but the next issue would be the price. For a building costing hundreds of thousands of EUR the price for a solar system is relatively low (compared to the building price). For a car, the relative price would be much higher, noticeably increasing the cars price ... and e-cars are trying to make their way in an extremely competitive environment, where even a few hundred EUR can already influence the purchase decision of a buyer.   Last but not least: cars are designed in their form and looks with specific goals in mind (good looks, areodynamics etc). Commercial solar panels cannot (yet) be brought into the form necessary for a seamless integration in the often curved roof or an engine hood. There are some developments where solar cells can be formed like plastics, but IIRC they are still a bit out of range of normal, large scale, commercial use.  In the end solar generation integrated into the hull of a vehicle will be coming, but only to supply some additional energy for onboard equipment like radios, lights etc.  SYL",

    "answer": "Rock music has its roots in rock and roll, which is music that you can dance the rock and roll to \u2014 a dance that\u2019s a simplified version of jive or swing.  This gives rock music its signature traveling beat, originally focused around accentuating the dancer\u2019s footwork.  Eventually the dance and its many variants (the twist, the locomotion, the Macarena,etc) faded, and the music started splintering into sub genres, and cross-breeding with jazz and blues.  One of those sub genres focused around the electric guitar and extended solos.  It was called metal because it was all about the metal electric guitar strings.  Heavy metal was when it was almost all focused on loud solos.  This spawned the likes of death metal which borrowed from the goth subculture and merged it with the rawness of heavy metal.",

    "answer": "\"Sunk cost fallacy\" is a common term, and probably where one of you heard the term for it to enter the conversation.  It refers to the thought process of \"I already spent some money on this. It would be a shame if I stopped spending money on it now.\" In other words, throwing \"good money after bad money.\"  You could imagine the fallacy as \"I bought a boat for $100, but then it sunk in the river. Because I don't want my $100 to be wasted, I'm going to rent a truck for $50 to pull it out. If that truck sinks into the mud, then I'll buy a different truck for $75 so that my $150 isn't wasted.\" The pattern then repeats.  In your specific conversation, the fact that you bought the investment means it is indeed a \"sunk cost\"; the fact that you aren't getting the same money back means it is sunk. If you spend more money on the investment just because you have the investment and are hoping it pays off, you are probably doing a \"sunk cost fallacy\". As a term it is entirely different from profit.  Most times, things that \"can be considered for profit\" use buzzwords and emotions to make people feel better about spending money, and thus spend more money.",

    "answer": "An inventor approached me with an idea of a  product that indicates if the seat is up or not. He asked me to design a product that will indicate if the seat is up with an LED light.   My first response was, sure I can design this for you, but why is this a problem that you think needs to be solved?  This was his explanation:  His wife, and and many of her friends, who are getting up in their age, have to pee in the middle of the night. So they go to the bathroom and sit down. Being half sleepy, and don't wanting to wake their husbands by turning on the light, they just go and sit down. And feel the cold porcelain rim of the toilet.  Women have to sit down to pee. Men don't. We men approach the toilet FACING towards it, so we see if the seat is up or down. So we see if the seat is up or down, and if it is down, we raise it and do our business.  But women, especially who are sleepy, walk backwards to the toilet, because they have to sit down. And they don't see the seat is up. Being sleepy, they sit down and feel the cold rim, which is not pleasant, especially at night.  I designed the thing, which was a small battery operated device that we put on the toilet lid, which indicated if the seat was up or down.   I don't think the product went anywhere. But this was the gist:  Men can see if the seat is up or down.  Woman may not, because they sometimes face the other way while sitting down.  So that's why it is polite to keep the seat down.  I thought the product was not that good, but I got paid for designing it. They got a a patent for it too.  EDIT: changed lid to seat, in some places, I was using the wrong words.",

    "answer": "Here's what happens: Chemically pure water doesn't conduct electricity by itself, deionized and distilled water are very poor conductors as well due to the very low electrolyte (mostly salts) concentration. So when you put a pair of electrodes in a cup containing some pure water or deionized water and try to let an electrical current flow, nothing happens. But then again, every day water is not chemically pure nor deionized (and there's no in-home system capable of obtaining that and there's no point in doing that).  If you were to add let's say table salt into the former system, then it would become an electrolytic cell, and chemical reactions would take place into the electrodes; specifically a reduction in the cathode and an oxidation on the anode. This is the point where the scam gets in action: the electrodes in the cell are made from metals, commonly aluminum and copper, copper gets oxidized because of it's reduction potential, therefore forming copper ions in solution.   There are many other reactions that could occur depending on the salts naturally dissolved in water, and all those reactions cross-react with copper ions (and any other harmless ions that might be in drinking water), forming a very chemically-diverse precipitate with a dark foul-color; giving the false idea that the tap water is filthy and unsafe, when in truth the electrodes are to blame.  On a side note, if both electrodes were made from platinum (a very chemically stable metal) you wouldn't see anything but a bubbling indicating water electrolysis into pure hydrogen and oxygen, no foul colors, no anything, because platinum won't oxidize in that setup.  In conclusion, as you already noted it, it's only a ruse to scare people into buying something.",

If you did high school physics then that covers how all of that works.   TMS uses a wand that generates a magnetic field that moves or flips, which generates electrical activity within your brain. The amount that it can generate is actually really small but its able to effect how the neurons in your brain work at least temporarily. This is because neurons communicate using a combination of electrical and chemical signalling.

    "question": "ELI5: Why are electric appliances (e.g. blender, vacuum) so loud, when electric motors are quiet?",
    "answer": "There can be a bunch of different reasons.  First, there are different kinds of motors. \"Brushed\" motors are cheaper, but the way they're put together makes them louder and more likely to break. \"Brushless\" motors are more expensive, quieter, and easier to maintain. But some high-quality appliances use brushless motors and are still loud. Why?  Size and cost are big reasons.   Appliance motors have to be very small and fit in small spaces. They generate a lot of heat and need to pull in air to cool themselves. There's not a lot of room for sound dampening or vibration isolation, and it would make the appliances cost more. Further, a lot of the premium devices are sold based on how much power they have, and people think a louder motor has more power. (They've never thought about how a lawnmower is often louder than a car!) So not a lot of people are really shopping for a *quiet* blender or vacuum, especially if it means they become so large they aren't easy to use or so expensive they aren't worth it.   Car motors, on the other hand, are part of a very expensive purchase. People expect them to be quiet, it's one of their selling points. The engineers have a lot of room, so ventilation is a lot easier to do and they have the budget to deal with vibration and sound dampening.",

    "answer": "> It can\u2019t just be inflation  The purchasing power of the dollar going down is literally what inflation is.  The purchasing power of the dollar going up is deflation.  It's bad.  You can see in your link when the purchasing power of the dollar went up in 1930 because that deflation was part of the Great Depression.  Deflation is bad because it kills production.  Suppose prices went down 10%, and people expect that to continue for a few years.  In that case, some people whose car is just old and janky are going to tough it out for another year instead of buying a new car, because with next year's deflation they'll be able to afford a top-of-the-line model instead of a base model.  This is great for them, but it means Ford only sells 800,000 cars instead of 1,000,000.  So, Ford lays off a bunch of people.  Who stop going to restaurants, and stop buying new appliances, and so on.  And the restaurants lay some people off, and so do the department stores selling appliances, and so do the appliance factories.  And all those people stop buying stuff, putting even more businesses out of business and causing even more layoffs.  And Ford also cancels its order for new factory equipment, since it now has more equipment than it needs to make 800,000 cars a year.  This means the equipment manufacturers lay people off, but it also means that Ford's processes don't improve at all.",

Printing stock option make the value of each option a little bit less. It dilutes them. Most investors don't like that at all.  But at the same time, it motivate the employee to make the company succeed as it increase the value of the shares and therefore the employee's income. So investors agree to have a little bit of that, typically, the higher up the hierarchy, the higher amount of your salary is in share form.  Every year the company will have a shareholder meeting where this kind of \"budget\" are voted. If you hold shares you can vote.  But the truth with shares (and that's why it's so hard to tax) is that they don't really have a monetary value until you try to sell them. And if a lot of share holder sell them at the same time, their value sink really quickly.

When people realized this, Hertz's stock spiked from the 50 cents it was worth, because after all it was believed that if you bought a share for say 1 dollar and after liquidation you would have gotten 2 dollars from the remaining assets, it would have been profitable even if the share ceased to exist afterwards.  In the vast majority of cases, Ch 7 bankruptcy happens when a company has more debt than assets though.

He imagined that if you moved away from the clock at the speed of light, and it says 12:01, it'll keep saying the same time as long as you're moving at the speed of light (you basically \"froze time\"), and that's because the light that's traveling to hit your eye pupils to tell you it's 12 o'clock is at the same speed as you're going. So 12:02 won't happen unless you started to slow down.  Edit: Punctuation.",

    "question": "ELI5: Can there be a machine that\u2019s an \u201canti-lightbulb\u201d?",
    "answer": "There are two answers to this question: No, because light doesn't work that way; *or* Yes, but it's Complicated.  On the \"no\" side, you have the fact that light, as a form of energy, can neither be created nor destroyed. It just moves around from place to place. (This is called the \"conservation of energy.\" For complicated math reasons, the fact that physics works the same if you \"run\" time forwards or backwards *requires* that energy cannot be destroyed.) So, as others have said, you could use something like a black hole to suck up light, but that's just shunting the light into that space, which isn't really the anti-lightbulb with a darkness aura around it like you are asking for.  On the \"yes\" side, there is a very complex, very difficult way that could *theoretically* work, but it would require much more advanced technology than we possess. This is because light is made of tiny wave-packets, which we call photons. Each photon, theoretically, has a perfect equal and opposite: one with the same amplitude, but exactly reversed peaks and troughs (high and low ponts) in the wave. If these waves meet perfectly, so each high part of one wave is exactly where the corresponding low part of the other wave is, then the effect is cancelled out, and it will be as if there is no photon present at all. Then they will pass by each other and be detectable again. If--and this is a very BIG if--you could make a device that could *exactly* match the incoming photons with its own outgoing photons, you could make an anti-lightbulb that would create a halo of unlit space around itself. This would be very, very difficult however, and we probably do not have computers good enough to calculate which light needs to go where *fast enough* to make one work, even in an extremely rigidly controlled environment.  However, while doing this with *light* is very hard, doing it with *sound* is actually (sort of) possible! As an example, think of being at a concert, where the same sound waves are being sent out of two different speaker units. If those speaker units are positioned correctly, there will be points where the sound waves from one speaker will exactly cancel out the sound waves of the other speaker, meaning a microphone at that point would hear (effectively) silence. The effect is not perfect silence normally, because in the real world, objects have volume, whereas the place where the waves cancel out is (in theory) a single point. But you can absolutely experience these points of silence in the real world! You can also get the exact opposite phenomena, where sound gets reinforced to become louder than it would be otherwise, because the two waves *stack* their high parts right on top of each other (same for the low parts).  The formal physics term for waves that cancel out is \"destructive interference\" (the two waves combine to make a \"weaker\" wave), and for waves that amplify it's called \"constructive interference\" (the two waves combine to make a \"stronger\" wave).",

    "question": "Eli5: why is there no test for the \u201cchemical imbalance\u201d that is often mentioned for depression?",
    "answer": "If it\u2019s any similar to some other hormones like the HPA axis, it\u2019s because there\u2019s only a very low amount of that chemical circulating in your body at a time. Most of it is produced in your brain and used a very short distance \u2018downstream\u2019 from there, which effectively leads to undetectable amounts in the wider circulation. So if you took a blood sample from someone\u2019s arm like we normally do, you would hardly detect the chemical, let alone be able to tell if there\u2019s an imbalance. You\u2019d have to take a blood sample inside the brain between the two specific points where the chemical is produced and absorbed again, to be able to tell anything at all.  That being said, things like depression or adhd are usually caused by neurotransmitter problems. They are molecules that you find in the brain and that allow one neurone to communicate with the next, but they are not found in blood much at all. So again you\u2019d have to somehow sample the connection between two neurones to measure the amount of neurotransmitter.  An easier way to do it is to monitor the effect of drugs that affect neurotransmitters. If you give them SSRIs (serotonin reuptake inhibitors), what you are doing is forcing serotonin to be present for a longer time before it is reabsorbed, thereby making sure the signal travels correctly from one neurone to the next. Normal people will react differently to the drug compared to depressed people with a serotonin deficiency as it were. Compare it to to adhd meds: normal people on adderall act all high, while people with adhd on adderall are able to calm down",

    "answer": "There are actually many genes involved in balding, some connected to the x chromosome and some the y. The main baldness  gene is found to be on the maternal x chromosome. So if you are male, you inherited your x chromosome from your mom. So the likelihood of you becoming bald is fairly high if your mom's dad was bald. But remember your mom has two x chromosomes so she may not have passed on the gene to her male child.  The male child may have gotten the mom's x chromosome that doesn't carry the gene. So just because your mom's dad is bald doesn't mean you will be but your chances are higher. Now if your y chromosome,  which you get from your dad, carries one of those other baldness genes NOT related to the x chromosome,  you still have a chance of being bald even if you did not inherit your mother's chromosome that has the main baldness gene. So, If your maternal grandfather is bald you have a high likelihood of going bald.

Everyday pain (particularly in elderly) : acetaminophen/paracetamol (Tylenol). Can be hard on the liver.  Arthritis pain: when the OTC pain killers don't cut it, other NSAIDs such as meloxicam (Mobic) or celecoxib (Celebrex) can be used. Easier on the stomach, harder on the heart.  More intense pain: injectable NSAIDs like ketorolac (Toradol) (really hard on kidneys) or opioids.   Nerve pain: not many great options, but gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), and a class of antidepressants called SNRIs (duloxetine and venlafaxine are the parent molecules) can be used. Methadone has also been useful in certain cases.   Centralized pain: this is a weird kind of pain where there isn't necessarily anything wrong, but you've been in pain so long that the pain center of your brain misfires and tells you you're in pain. Very hard to treat, but treatment is similar to nerve pain.   Migraines: NSAIDs can be used OTC.

Cancer pain: generally opioids. Can step down if the pain isn't too bad.   Bone pain (usually associated with bone cancer, chemo, or bone marrow transplant): can use zoledronic acid and/or an antihistamine like Claritin or Zyrtec.

Basically, it\u2019s anything low in fibre, high in sugar, and lacking fermentation.  Fibre increases faecal bulking, which stops your stool from becoming compact and hard.   It also draws water into your colon through *osmotic pressure* and encourages gut motility.

If your food is low in fibre, you have none of these benefits, and you are at risk of constipation.  If you eat a diet that has very little fermented food (cheese, yoghurt, kombucha, beer) then you also may become constipated.   These foods contain bacteria that help your intestines function.   They promote gut motility by irritating your gut lining.   They also help digest some of the food you eat and spit out things you need but can\u2019t make by yourself - things like vitamins.

    "answer": "During the last three months of pregnancy the mother's body will pass antibodies to the baby. This is called passive immunity. It is why DTAP vaccining (for whopping cough, tetanus, diphtheria) is recommended for pregnant women. DTAP is usually a ten year vaccine but it if you are pregnant it will be recommend every pregnancy because that way the immune system reacts to the vaccine and the baby will get the antibodies. If it has been a year or more than the antibodies might not be past on.  Anyway breastmilk is made from glands in the mother's bloodstream so the antibodies can continue to be past to the baby while being breastfed. If the baby is born healthy and full term their immune system is developed around 2 to 3 months of age. So they don't need mom's antibodies anymore. So you definitely want to keep on schedule with childhood vaccines because breast milk isn't an alternative to that.   Also in a controlled study called [PROBIT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11242425/) the short term health benefits of breastfeeding is thin.

    "answer": "Back in the 2017 crypto bull run, bitcoin was really expensive to send around because of the network congestion but sending eth around was super cheap. Since eth allows you to do smart contracts, you can make an eth token called \u201cbitcoin\u201d (or \u201cwrapped bitcoin\u201d so it doesn\u2019t confuse people), and essentially lock up an actual bitcoin in a ethereum smart contract and send around that eth token (called eth wrapped bitcoin) instead.   The real bitcoin is still there, gaining or losing value, but you can send around your eth token and pay minimal eth fees instead of sending around that actual bitcoin.  Fast forward to this bull run and people made jokes how it should be bitocin wrapped eth now (since eth fees got pretty ridiculous). This can\u2019t happen quite yet because bitcoin can\u2019t do smart contracts.  It\u2019s basically a bridge between chains. So you can use any coin on any network.  Edit:  I\u2019m going to add to this because I\u2019m obsessed with crypto and want everyone else to be as well.   You may see tokens like cETH, aUSDC, or CAKE-LP (as opposed to the actual assets: ETH, USDC, or CAKE). These are called proof of ownership tokens. You can look at them like receipts.   For example, let\u2019s say I have some USDC (US dollar coin), and I want to get interest on my USDC. To do this, I deposit them into a lending pool (let\u2019s say I use the Aave protocol). Once they leave my wallet, I get aUSDC (Aave USDC) in return. This is an absolutely amazing and overlooked feature of crypto. This aUSDC I have is just as valuable as the asset itself + any interest it\u2019s generating. If I sent you my aUSDC tokens, you can withdraw all my usdc (and any accrued interest) out of Aave. This allows the usdc holder to not only gain interest in the Aave lending pool but now take that \u201creceipt\u201d and use that value somewhere else to generate even more passive income.   Uhhhg I could go on but then I\u2019ll for sure be treading on waters that are too difficult for 5 year olds if I haven\u2019t already >.<  Dm me if you have any questions!

    "answer": "This hopefully counts as eli5 answer: gradients tell you how fast a thing changes. So you need two inputs: what is the thing you're looking at, and what's the knob you turn to make the thing change. Usually the first input is a number, or numbers, say, the temperatures of every key on your keyboard. There are typically two knobs to turn: the time knob or the \"space\" knob. They just return different gradients. The time knob will take only one key of the keyboard as input and will tell you how fast the current temperature of that key changes over time. Use another key as input, and you get the current change of temperature. This is a gradient over time, it will tell you how the input temperature changes at one point on the keyboard.  The other knob is the spatial knob. It takes as input the key again, but it will tell you how the temperature changes as you move from this key down, or left. So while the first gradient is change in temperature per minute, the second is change in temperature per inch. As such, a gradient can be used as prediction. If you know the current temperature of a key and the time-gradient, you can calculate roughly how warm the key will be in 3 minutes. And likely: if you know the spacial gradient, you can estimate how warm the key on the left is.  Edit: using time and space knobs are the most common  gradients. But there are more knobs, generally anything that has an influence on your input can be used as knob: everything else returns a very boring gradient that is 0 everywhere, no matter how much you turn that knob, your input doesn't change.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why does sickness usually become worse at night?",
    "answer": "You aren't actually sicker at night, but you may feel sicker because your body is more actively fighting your illness.  Cortisol, a hormone made by the adrenal glands, regulates your immune system, among other things. More cortisol circulates in your blood during the day, suppressing your immune system so you can get stuff done.   Less cortisol circulates at night, allowing your white blood cells to go to work and detect and fight infections. But that means you'll have more symptoms of infection at night.",

    "answer": "A good rule of thumb is that radio signals either go real far or can carry a lot of data.  When you get low frequency it will go a long long way but can barely carry anything and when you get high frequency it can carry a ton of data but can get stopped by a wall or water in the air or anything.     So the 'best' frequencies are the ones in the middle that can go pretty far and carry pretty much data. But all the radio frequencies kinda got assigned real lazy as new stuff got invented so things like music radio and tv got to take it all, and the military got the rest.      CBRS is a tiny tiny slice of spectrum the navy owned that it is giving to the public which will get used for some combination of wifi and cell phones. Which can have speeds like 5G but not need to do the 5G thing of needing super high power towers every mile.

    "question": "ELI5: Why does donating blood make me feel very hot and sweaty?",
    "answer": "What you are describing is some of the first symptoms of shock due to a too low blood pressure. This is normal as you have just donated blood. In addition you should also have an elevated but weaker then normal pulse, a bit of a thirst and cold dry skin. They make sure you do not get low enough blood pressure that you will struggle with these symptoms or even feel much of it but there is a reason you are given the option of the recovery table and given cookies and something to drink.  The feeling of being hot and sweating due to low blood pressure is likely an unintended neurological quirk. What the body is trying to do is to make sure the remaining blood you have stays in the core of the body where it is most needed instead of going close to your skin and into your extremities. But this is normally something which is done to regulate body heat. So as the control of the blood flow is suddenly changed from maintaining temperature to increasing your blood pressure you start to lose control over the core temperature and it triggers other ways of cooling down such as generating the feeling of being hot and sweating.  But this does not quite explain it as one of the more serious symptoms of shock is actually reduced body temperature. So the sweating and feeling of being hot is actually going to work too well over time. This does mean that there is a more serious interaction with the different neural functions in the brain which is not fully understood.  Do not be afraid of telling the nurses about your symptoms. They are in a much better position then you to understand what levels of blood loss are actually dangerous. If they are worried they do have instruments they can hook up to you in order to get your blood pressure and pulse to check if your blood pressure have gone too far down. They can also do a few tests such as your blood sugar and hemoglobin content, something they probably did before you donated as well. Using this they can delay your next visit to help you build more blood volume, give you minerals to help combat deficiencies which again can help you build more blood for next time or reduce the amount of blood you donate. If they see that the situation is critical they can have a doctor look at you and then give you back some fluids directly or even give you back your own blood that you just donated.",
    "follow-up": "I've donated enough times to know how I react to the procedure. It just surprises me at how much sweat I leave behind. When I got up, there was a big patch of sweat, and I could feel my shirt and pants sticking to me. I know to tell the nurses if I start to not feel good. I always grab a water before I get on the table, and I'll usually tell them that I have a tendency of getting hot.   They do check my iron levels before I donate. There's two different places I can donate through. There's the Red Cross and another blood bank that's more local. They measure the levels differently, or some such thing. The Red Cross wants my iron to be around 13 something. The other place is some other measurement that's supposed to be in the 30's? I take iron every day to make sure I have enough.   I'm usually pretty much back to normal after a few minutes at the table, but I've just wondered about the unpleasantness I experience on the table. Thanks for the informative answer!"

In compiled languages like Java and C/C++, the code gets transformed into a computer runnable executable after you write it, which consists of binary instructions. This transformation is a process called \"compilation\".  By far the biggest non compiled language in use today is Python. In python, the code actually gets turned into binary on the fly as you run it.  Quick edit for clarification: A compiler can mean multiple things. If someone is talking about a Java compiler, they are generally referring to the entire pipeline that converts Java into machine code.

    "answer": "Boobs are on anatomically female bodies, moobs are on anatomically male bodies. It's not much more than that.  Boobs form when the body has high levels of oestrogen, a growth hormone usually found in high levels in women and low levels in men. Oestrogen signals to the cells that they should grow into a female body plan, including growing breasts during and after puberty. Boobs are comprised of two tissue types - glandular tissue that's theoretically suitable for milk production (although won't actually produce milk until after pregnancy occurs), and fatty tissue.   Moobs can form as a result of unusually high oestrogen, in which case they will develop both tissue types and be anatomically identical to boobs (this is particularly useful medically, as it allows trans women to grow breasts by simply adding oestrogen to the system), but more commonly they're just a build-up of fat, in which the fatty tissues of the upper chest swell up in a way that looks like boobs, but no glandular tissue forms, which is  why fat moobs have a different shape to boobs. Although, fat does increase oestrogen production in the body, so a sufficiently fat person may end up developing small amounts of glandular tissue as a result of the extra oestrogen.",

    "answer": "The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon is actually a term for 'frequency illusion', a type of cognitive bias your mind creates. To understand this, you need to know a little about cognitive bias as a whole. Though there's a whole lot of nuisances caused by cognitive bias, in short, it\u2019s when your mind deviates from normal, rational thought and starts to make up patterns based off of nonsense.   \u2026frequency illusion is, in fact, two different processes happening at the same time: selective attention and confirmation bias.  The first process, selective attention, comes about when you learn anything new. Basically, when you learn something new, it stays fresh in your mind - you\u2019re paying more attention to it than other things. Because of this, you see it more often when going about your daily life.  However, this very simple, logical process is amped up by confirmation bias, which is a cognitive bias that makes you \"search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions, leading to statistical errors\", reports ScienceDaily.  This means that your mind is on the look-out for newly learned information because it\u2019s still super fresh and interesting to you. At the same time, your mind sees these new words everywhere, thinks that it's weird, and tries to make it fit into some rational system.  In other words, because the information is new, you suddenly force yourself to believe that it's new to everyone and has suddenly popped up, when in reality, you\u2019ve just stopped ignoring it.  You actually see new words more often and believe there\u2019s some weird pattern at work because your mind is trying to make sense of new information.

While people like to compare Jeff Bezos' fortune to the average Amazon worker's salary and say \"inequality as never before\", that's not true.  It you compare the wealth of a 16th century french king to a 16th century peasant, the inequality was much worse in the 16th century.  Since the era of the pyramids (5000 years ago) it's been important for the people on the \"got a lot\" side of inequality to offer some justification for why they have so much more than everybody else.  Religion was invented for this purpose.  Kings were \"God on Earth\", or had \"Divine Right to Rule\".  The purpose of churches was to make the \"not got a lot\" people happy with the situation, and they often did that by promising them a better life in the future (aka after they died).

And you could write an equation to describe how these numbers change that agrees exactly with how a 3D creature could model the \"height\" of the wave.  In the same way, we can apply this same equation - with three position coordinates instead of two - to 3D space. Every point in space has a number attached to it, and those numbers change according to a law that is mathematically related to the same law that governs the height of the water on a 2D surface.

    "answer": "There would be no way to route traffic efficiently without IP addressing.  The only way it's done efficiently is by knowing based on network address where to route your traffic.  Think of it more like sending something in the mail, vs a phone book.  You need multiple pieces of information to get it to the right place right?  You need Zip Code (US), State, City, Street Address, and Person.  You mail that piece of mail from one side of the US to another, the first thing they do is look at that information to determine how it's going to get to it's destination.  You can't just put a name on there, as there is no way for the mail service to know that name out of the 300 million people living in the US.  So they start with ZIP code (which is really smaller than state), then narrow it down by street address, then eventually when it gets into your mailbox your wife hands you the mail because it ends up with your name on it.  Same way IPs work.  The numbers are not just randomly assigned.  Network address space is reserved by classes.  And routing tables know where those addresses are assigned to.  We know that everything 8.x.x.x is going somewhere, and everything that 9.x.x.x is going somewhere.  Then, as it gets closer to the destination, we use the additional digits to pinpoint where it's going until we get to the last digit and then we have the server.  Also, its VERY important to know, that name does not equal 1 server or IP address.  For example, when you go to [google.com](https://google.com) you go to 10000s of servers, not just a single server with a single IP address.  Also, for smaller setups, 1 server can house multiple IP addresses.  I have 5 domain names hosted on a single IP address.  That's why you can't just go to a name.  Really the name gets resolved to an address (or one in a pool of addresses), and then when you hit that server your browser says \"Hey, I'm trying to get to [myfavoritedomain.com](https://myfavoritedomain.com)\" and the web server serves it up.",

Not that big, but you would need about 3 or 4 thousand floppy disks worth of information to install a windows 10 operating system to a current computer, because each floppy disk was capable of only several kilobytes or megabytes of info. Now we can do it in minutes with a terabyte sized thumb drive.   If we extrapolate that and try and predict the future, we will be capable of increasing storage technology faster than we can create things to fill that information up.

Any changes there (blood vessels dilatation, weather changes which causes intracranial pressure shifts etc) triggers that nerve saying something is happening with your brain. Sometimes it can be caused by head/neck muscles strains.     more ELI5 : **some brain vessels dilated => trigeminal nerve sends information to brainstem that we have some \"brain\" pain => pain**  In migraine, it's usually the same pathway BUT this cranial nerve (trigeminal) is in a \"panic mode\". It reacts so much to this input, that he releases special chemicals (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), P substance etc) that exacerbate blood vessels dilation and cause more inflammation which AGAIN amplifies the vasodilation, leakage of blood vessels, and degranulation of mast cells (immune response) and the sensory input receives this information and makes MORE substances to evoke a more stronger response.  more ELI5: **some brain vessels dilated => trigeminal nerve makes substances that trigger immune response/more vasodilation AND sends information to brainstem that we have some serious \"brain\" pain => big pain => trigeminal nerve makes MORE substances in response to that brainstem response => MORE and WORSE pain.**    And in migraine this cycle can be triggered by diffent stimuli (coffee, low glucose, light, tiredness, lack of sleep etc)   But still the EXACT mechanisms of these condition are not well understood.",

    "answer": "If I'm not mistaken, you're asking why in an enclosed are like a room, walls aren't always continuous but have columns sticking out. Is that it?  The answer is that, except in special cases, walls do not support anything (but their own weight), but columns do. This is why when you see a building being constructed, you see the frame (beams and columns) being built first, and then walls built later. This is why you sometimes see beams sticking out from the sides of the roof. In this case, we say that walls (called curtain walls) are not an active structural element: they do not contribute to the supporting frame. They're there like curtains: because nobody likes to live in a room with no walls (but they're also helpful in avoiding certain complex loads).  Slabs that make the floor are typically supported by the horizontal beams on the side (and sometimes columns when they're huge). Beams are supported by columns around the corners, and they're sometimes hidden. Columns are supported by the frame from the lower level, and so on..all the way to the foundations.  There are cases when architectural considerations make it difficult to use columns and beams only, so \"supporting walls\" are sometimes added.",

    "answer": "During the last three months of pregnancy the mother's body will pass antibodies to the baby. This is called passive immunity. It is why DTAP vaccining (for whopping cough, tetanus, diphtheria) is recommended for pregnant women. DTAP is usually a ten year vaccine but it if you are pregnant it will be recommend every pregnancy because that way the immune system reacts to the vaccine and the baby will get the antibodies. If it has been a year or more than the antibodies might not be past on.  Anyway breastmilk is made from glands in the mother's bloodstream so the antibodies can continue to be past to the baby while being breastfed. If the baby is born healthy and full term their immune system is developed around 2 to 3 months of age. So they don't need mom's antibodies anymore. So you definitely want to keep on schedule with childhood vaccines because breast milk isn't an alternative to that.   Also in a controlled study called [PROBIT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11242425/) the short term health benefits of breastfeeding is thin.

We are normally taught in school that reproduction works like this (in humans), Females have XX, males have XY, and the child is some combination of those X and Y chromosomes.  &#x200B;  Now, most people assume that you get one of two X chromosomes from your mother, and either the X or Y chromosome from your father. However, that would give you a tiny amount of 4 unique combinations if it was that simple. If you have ever known family that has more than 4 kids, you can tell that reproduction must be more complicated than that since you don't end up with \"duplicate\" kids.   &#x200B;  Now, whiptail lizards are special even among animals that asexually reproduce. Instead of a normal \"clone\" they basically are able to act like the mother and father. Imagine taking two eggs, (instead of an egg and sperm) and making an embryo from it. So it would be as if you had a pair of twins who had a baby together. Just like there are more than 4 options in human reproduction, a pair of twins would not necessarily produce identical offspring (for instance, both of them could have one dominant gene and one recessive gene. If they both contributed the recessive gene, their offspring would have 2 recessive genes, and look different).  &#x200B;  Now the genetic diversity is still less than you might expect in a sexually reproducing species, but it does allow the species to have more variety than you might expect.",

You have one high level goal in running Amazon - make money for yourself, and make money for your shareholders. You can accomplish that goal in two ways, sell more things and reduce your expenses. You're probably already selling as much as you can, so the easiest way to have the lowest possible expenses is to pay your employees as little as you can get away with. Most of the rest of the economy is run by other Bezoses who have more or less the same goals - workers are, as a result, forced to work for less than the value of their labour because there's a lack of better options.  Theres a snowball effect that takes place here - the bigger Amazon gets, the more money and influence you have and the more you're able to accept risks and expand your company - big companies have an easier time getting even bigger than smaller ones. You're also more able to influence government policy by lobbying or threatening to move jobs abroad if, say, minimum wage or tax rates were to increase. As more and more of the economy is absorbed by these massive corporations smaller businesses where individuals or small groups of employees have bargaining power fall by the wayside. A single worker at your company has no ability to demand a better wage since they can easily be fired and replaced by an even more desperate person who needs the wage to live.  To put it as simply as possible, those middle class jobs have begun to disappear because it's more profitable to pay your employees less. The less of those jobs there are the more people are forced to work lower paying jobs out of desperation, and as more people work in these jobs at or below the poverty line they become less able to have any influence on this system as they have no time to politically organize when they're working two jobs and no bargaining power when they're easily replaceable.

Socially, that implies that a hybrid neanderthal-human individual was not only possible, but that such individuals were accepted parts of their community and lived until adulthood (implying they weren't too weak or sickly to survive). Depending on ancestry there's also a very high likelihood that a given individual will carry the markers of minor neanderthal  additions to their genes. It's much lower in sub-Saharan groups, much higher in Eurasian, because neanderthals really didn't backtrack from Eurasia into Africa once they evolved.  There's also a high margin of human-caused extinction through out-competing them. Tools known to be made by neanderthals as opposed to modern human ancestors don't show many significant changes over an astoundingly long time- We were figuring out how to make better tools, they weren't. With better tools, we had better living. Eventually, it's suggested, there just became more and more of us, less and less of them, until we were all that was left.   More like neighborhood gentrification, and less of an explicit war where two groups met on a battlefield and murdered each other to death.     There's also an argument to be made for climate change as a cause.

Eventually they changed to a point of not being able to support the megafauna.... Or the neanderthals.

(Wich basically flips each bit of the original if the corresponding bit of the random number is 1)  So to undo that you need the encrypted data and the same random number. Just apply XOR again to flip the correct bits back.  XOR(A, B) = C -> XOR(C, B) = A  This number isn't truly random. It's generated by an algorithm from a password (or Key).

    "answer": "Think of it as your body losing a crutch.  Essentially, when you become addicted to something, your body becomes chemically dependent on it, it establishes a new homeostasis around the presence of that chemical.  So, when you use nicotine, it binds to a series of receptors in your brain, which then causes those receptors to send signals that RELEASE MORE of the the neurotransmitters like Dopamine.  So, nicotine essentially forces your body to produce more dopamine (along with other things) which is why it makes you feel \u201cgood\u201d  Your body then adjusts its natural balance, it\u2019s homeostasis, around the fact that you\u2019re getting that extra source of dopamine.  That means when you cut out the nicotine, that extra dopamine goes away, and the things that were making dopamine before are still turned down/not producing because the body is expecting the nicotine dopamine.  It takes time for those other processes to come back up to speed hike your body establishes a NEW homeostasis without the nicotine dopamine, meaning that for a while you are missing some neurotransmitters, which causes those shitting feeling withdrawal symptoms, until your body figures itself out again and gets back in balance.",

This can be tested easily, really: from in front of an actual heater (or preferably, a campfire) walk away, and notice how the cold air suddenly feels colder.  This is because the feeling of \"cold\" is actually the feeling of your body losing heat to the environment (usually cold air, but really everything you're in contact with that is colder than you). The greater the difference, the faster that heat transfer happens (slowing down as the difference gets smaller), and as such, you would feel a colder cold at the same temperatures.

    "answer": "Forgive me if any of this is off, I took the applicable courses for this like 20 years ago, so probably don't remember everything. But in essence:   Metabolism is the process by which your body converts what you eat and drink into energy. Calories are combined with oxygen to release the energy your body needs to function. You burn calories even while at rest, in order to supply the energy your body needs. The number of calories your body uses to carry out these basic functions is known as your basal metabolic rate. In addition to your basal metabolic rate, two other factors determine how many calories your body burns each day (Food processing (thermogenesis) and Physical activity). A portion of calories not burned through these processes is converted into glycogens (sugar essentially), which are easily accessed and metabolised first. The rest are stored by your body in the form of fat, which is retained to supply energy when there aren't enough other nutrients available.  The weight of calorie dense foods does not translate into the amount of weight gained. That weight is determined by the amount of extra calories stored by your body. To translate this into numbers, each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories. The human body needs to burn about 4100 calories to burn that lbs of fat, which will only happen if there are no other easily accessible calories (like glycogens) available.  So, if you consume something calorie dense that exceeds the number of calories your body needs to function, the rest will be stored as fat. Do this often enough, and you'll gain weight.",

The carbon-containing compounds react with the oxygen in the air, and tend to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor as a result.  However, that reaction only fully proceeds to completion under ideal conditions. Under most real-world conditions, there is incomplete combustion, which means the carbon-containing molecules only get partially broken up. Sometimes they loop back on themselves to form a ring-like structure. Sometimes they attach to other similarly-shaped molecules in chains. There are all sorts of chemicals created during combustion, depending on what you started with and what conditions you\u2019re burning in.

Epinephrine (also called adrenaline) is a very important neurotransmitter, and that's also what's in EpiPens. But this doesn't always work for a few reasons.  First, a lot of those chemicals can't easily get from our blood into our brain tissue (or vice versa) since there's a protective barrier. Even the dopamine pump above uses a modified version of dopamine that can, but we can't always do that well.  Second, when you dump a bunch of hormones or chemicals on the body the body reacts by making less of that hormone itself to try to keep itself in balance. This can sometimes cause serious side effects.  Third, very very few problems in the brain are due to a simple issue of \"not enough of a single chemical\" (even Parkinson's, which is basically caused by the brain not being able to make dopamine anymore, is more complicated) You don't water plants in your house with a fire hose because the water that's really good for the plants isn't so great for your computer on the desk next to them.

Eventually, these forces will come to equilibrium - probably a bit more expensive than before, but not at an unreasonable level.  - The idea is that everyone gets the UI check regardless.  You can still earn a wage, though, and that wage would be taxed.

    "question": "ELI5 where does the money go when markets are down?",
    "answer": "Into different classes of assets, typically gold, government bonds, anything that investors view as more stable. That said, the *reason* markets are down is usually because of a sweeping price correction, ie: something people had *thought* was worth a lot of money suddenly turns out to be worth far less.  When times are \"good\" and everyone thinks they're getting rich, they'll be able to spend more money bidding up the price of investments, because that's generally the smartest thing to do with your money: Invest it into something which will earn you more money. The problem occurs when there's a new class of investment which appears to be \"too good to be true\". Dot.com stocks in 2001, Mortgage-backed securities in 2008, are good examples of this.  John Maynard Keynes, the economist for whom \"Keynesian Economics\" is named, uses a metaphor to describe the stock market: The [beauty contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest):  >Keynes described the action of rational agents in a market using an analogy based on a fictional newspaper contest, in which entrants are asked to choose the six most attractive faces from a hundred photographs. Those who picked the most popular faces are then eligible for a prize.  So, everyone is trying to guess what the most popular faces will be, not necessarily the faces they actually think are the most attractive. This phenomenon is how bubbles form. Many investors will put money into a bubble, on the undertaking that they're better off pumping their money with everyone else caught up in the enthusiasm, then dumping their position at the peak of the buying hysteria. Of course, that means timing is very important. Wait too long, and you can lose your stake on a wildly overinflated bubble, and fundamentally, the people holding bubble stocks are buying them on the hope they can find someone gullible enough to buy the stocks at their now-inflated price.  So, how does a bubble pop? Why can't everyone just keep trading back shares and making more and more money? Because investments are still tied to real things, and if those real things cease to exist, then the investment becomes worthless. So, if you have $100 in ABC stock, and ABC announces that they're going into bankruptcy restructuring because they're deeply in debt, suddenly your $100 worth of stock is worth much, much less, because it turns out the company you own is about to not exist.  This is what happened in 2008, and 2001. In both cases, the underlying asset people had bought shares in simply disappeared. The borrowers defaulted on their loans in 2008, and the dot.com businesses which weren't making profits closed, and the securities backed by these entities were suddenly worth nothing.  If this is an isolated company that's folding, no big deal, right? The people who are left holding worthless paper get hosed, but everyone else is unaffected. But when this starts to happen a *lot*, suddenly people who've been spending money based on overvalued assets are struck with a reality-check are unable to make payments. So, after your $100 worth of ABC stock vanished, you responsibly decide to stop your subscription for company DEF. In the next quarter, DEF reports that their revenue has dropped, and the putative value of DEF has dropped because it's now a less profitable company. Now the people holding DEF stock cut some expenses, and reduce the revenue of company GHI, and so on.  What's important to recognize is that economies are *reciprocal*. They call it the economic engine, after all. Your income is my expense, and vice-versa. When we all stop spending money, we all stop earning money, and suddenly everyone's cashflow gets tighter.",

Mass is a property that particles can have, its a way for energy to be stored but not the only way and not all particles have mass.  Most things you deal with are large and are made up of massive quantities of particles which all have mass so most stuff you think of has mass, but the light from the sun doesn't have mass but it can still push things because a photon's energy is in its momentum (not mass*velocity but a more intrinsic momentum).  You'll often see E=mc^2 (energy = mass * speed of light^2) but the full equation is E^2 = p^(2)c^(2)+m^(2)c^(4) where p is momentum.  Photons have momentum but not rest mass which forces them to travel at the speed of light, nothing with mass can reach the speed of light without infinite energy and nothing without mass can travel at any other speed.  Basically the universe has a set of fields that things interact with.  The electromagnetic field interacts with charge and magnetism, its force is carried by photons.

    "question": "eli5 what is diabetes exactly? what is the difference between type 1 and 2 ?",
    "answer": "Diabetes, the word, just means urinating too much. But by diabetes, we mean \"Diabetes Mellitus\" which basically means that the patient's urine is sweet! Since it has sugar in it.  We have 2 types of Diabetes:   Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus T2DM).  The Eli5 would be:  T1DM: For reasons that we don't fully understand, the body uses the immune system to destroy parts of the pancreas that create Insulin. Without insulin, your cells (mainly muscles) cannot absorb sugar from your blood. The blood sugar goes up, while the cells are starving. It creates many issues and can lead to death. It starts during childhood.  T2DM: In this case, the body is able to create insulin, but for reasons (That we don't fully understand) the body develops \"insulin resistance\". It means despite insulin being present, the cells do not get the message. Blood sugar goes high and causes many complications. Altho the chances of death are not as much as T1DM since there would be no Ketoacidosis.  &#x200B;  Obviously, there are many details that I put aside.

My mother would swear them off as death traps on a highway.  These days though, 4 cylinders are plenty fast enough for highway acceleration and are still way more fuel efficient than a 6.

    "answer": "Not an expert but my best guess is mostly cost, and safety.   If a Lipo takes an impact that can puncture it, there's a chemical fire that's spews poisonous gas. If a lead acid gets a puncture, there's a leak that can cause chemical burns if mishandled.  Lead acid batteries last a few years in a vehicle. Given the cost of repairs in other parts of the vehicle, the lifespan of some vehicles, and the low cost of occasionally topping up the battery until it needs complete replacing, having a lead acid vs lipo isn't that big a deal.   Others have already mentioned how lipos struggle at low temps, but high temps are a big issue too. The battery needs to output a kilowatt for a few seconds, to crank the engine, which for a lead acid warms it slightly but no big deal, but for a Lipo, that would bring it to a really high temp. Lipos at high temp are more prone to exploding. So starting an older engine that needs cranking longer than few seconds is rolling the dice.  All this given in mind, lead acids are the best of a bad bunch. The only other work around is using a Lipo as a battery bank, and a super capacitor bank to crank the engine, which solves the high output when cranking. Then adding heating and cooling elements to the battery case to solve the low and high temps during use. Then specially designing a lipo and it's case to make sure during a crash it doesn't explode.  At that point though you've massively increased the cost to install the lipo effectively, making it's use as a battery crank overkill, or go with it and make a hybrid or electric car. Might as well just use a generic lead acid and forget about it.",

    "question": "eli5: How does patents work?",
    "answer": "Patents are a way to make sure that if you invent something new, you have the exclusive right to make money off of it for some time. In return, you have to publish all of the details of your invention so that after your time is over, other people can use it, compete with you, and perhaps improve upon it.  To get a patent, you have to make a document that describes your invention in detail. The invention has to meet a lot of criteria, but to oversimplify the patent examiners have to decide your invention looks unique \"enough\". The rules about what that means are pretty complicated, and some people's entire careers are devoted to that!  Once you have the patent, for some number of years you are the ONLY person allowed to make and sell the invention. You can license that right to other people if you want, but the point is YOU control that invention for a time and for someone to use it, they have to have your blessing. The number of years can be different depending on what kind of patent you have. If someone else makes the same thing or even something very similar, you have a right to sue them for patent infringement.   After the period is over, anyone can read your patent document and make the invention and you no longer have the right to sue them. If you want to keep being the only person with that invention, you have to find some way to make a new version worthy of a new patent, but you still can't stop people from making and selling the old one.   This is different from copyrights and trademarks. To compare and contrast with oversimplifications:  * **Copyright** is not something you apply for, it's granted the moment you produce a copyrightable work (typically some kind of art). Other people can't copy your copyrighted material without your permission, though there are some very complicated \"fair use\" laws that allow people to use tiny pieces as long as they follow some rules. It can expire but is typically VERY long term such as 20 years or \"until the author dies\". * **Trademarks** have to be registered and are very specifically limited to images, slogans, songs, and a few other types of art. These are typically used for branding and marketing. They MUST be renewed to remain valid, but there aren't limits to how often you can renew them. There are some weird processes where you can lose your right to claim a trademark, but they're pretty complicated. * **Patents** tend to cover inventions rather than artwork. They must be applied for, and the invention has to be pretty unique to get a patent. You MUST publish enough information to teach someone how it works to get a patent, because the intent is after the patent expires anybody is allowed to make it.  Sometimes someone might choose not to patent an invention and instead just try to keep it secret. For example, consider \"secret formulas\" like the recipe for Coca-Cola. If they had applied for a patent, they would have to publish the recipe and anyone could make an EXACT version of it by now. So instead, they kept it a secret. There are lots of copycat colas on the market now, and Coca-Cola can't sue people for that, but they CAN claim that nobody else has *exactly* the same recipe.",

The engine and transmission can also be installed as a compact unit which makes assembly easier and faster.  All the engine weight also pushes down on the drive wheels which helps with traction and braking and therefore makes the car safer.

The prefix post- doesn't mean \"rejection of\" in labelling these kinds of philosophical and artistic movements, but rather more \"acceptance of and progression from.\" So post-modernism is an acceptance of and progression from some of the things you attribute to it here.  To understand modernity and modernism as a broad ideology, it helps to consider the early 20thC context, where colonial atrocities and the horrors of WWI were starting to be hard to ignore for intellectuals. Modernists were intrinsically disillusioned by the old grand truths (or metanarratives) of the Western world: War is honourable. Religion is Civilization. Science is Progress. Modernists skewed nihilist. They sought to represent reality with granular truth, not grand truth, in formally innovative ways, and if the outcome was against moralistic messages of the past, so be it.  Post-modernism came about not as a rejection of this, but more as an acceptance that our structures and metanarratives, however illusionary,  are how we create meaning. They just tend to approach these grand institutions ironically (think a screenprinted soup can on an art gallery's wall: it's not denying cultural values, it's just trying to re-evaluate them in interesting ways. Or a Tarantino film that uses a generic Western franchise in homage, but also to discuss race by revising history). So where modernism was dismissive of grand narratives (like the American Dream), post-modernism is generally more playful. A lot of what we call post-modern is actually just modern, mind you.",

Accounting for your initial vector and the movement of your target, basically directly going on an intercept course... you could *totally* do that - if you had a rocket with arbitrarily large thrust and arbitrarily large fuel reserves!   The kind of fledgling space travel conducted by humans in the immediate vicinity of our home planet is not really limited by travel time or distance, it is limited by the physical and chemical restrictions imposed by our current level of engineering. Rocket motors that do what you envision do not exist.   Engineers have to desperately scrounge for every last bit of efficiency that can be wrought out of the limited fuel reserves that contemporary space craft are physically able to carry in relation to their payload. That means abusing every possibility of a [gravity assist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit), that means launching rockets from the equator, that means launching rockets into the direction of the Earth's spin, that means timing your [gravity turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_turn) properly and that means *not going straight up*.",

    "answer": "A cancer cell is just a regular cell with imperfectly copied or damaged DNA.  Most often, that damage means the cell won't be able to survive and perform its function and the cell dies (or is killed by the immune system) without causing any harm.  Sometimes, the DNA damage causes the cell to survive, grow, and reproduce uncontrollably, potentially spreading to other areas of the body.  At this point, the cells are considered cancerous and can grow and multiply to form tumors, ignore signals to stop growing, redirect bloodflow from the body to keep themselves growing, 'hide' from the immune system by appearing to be healthy, and potentially move into new areas of the body.  The damage to the DNA can come from any number of sources, from a simple mistake in making a copy to direct damage from UV radiation to carcinogenic chemicals that enter the cell and cause damage.",

If you're particularly geeky, \"Hey, Einstein, I'm on your side!\"  Something else he's known for is the theory of *relativity* (two of them, actually) which say that a lot of things are *relative to* other things -- that is, they can't be objectively measured. Specifically, we're interested in the components of both theories that talk about time.  The theory of *special relativity* says that a moving clock ticks slower than a stationary clock. That is, a clock that's moving very fast will measure time slower ***relative to*** a clock that's not moving. It won't see its own seconds passing any slower, but it will see a stationary clock's seconds passing *faster.*  The other theory, about *general* relativity, says that a clock deeper in a gravity well ticks slower than one farther away. Conversely, a clock further away ticks faster.  Put these two together, and someone living on a space station actually experiences the flow of time very slightly differently: after spending six months aboard the ISS, Einstein's theories predict that an astronaut would age about 0.005 seconds *less* than us schlubs on Earth.",

But relative *to your fast-moving car*, rain is traveling downwards *and backward* - in other words, from the perspective of the car, the rain is falling at an angle that tilts it into your windshield and away from the back window.  Raindrops fall fairly slowly - the very largest raindrops fall at [about 10 m/s or a little over 20 mph](https://gpm.nasa.gov/resources/faq/how-fast-do-raindrops-fall). That means that if you're going at highway speeds (say, 30 m/s), the tilt of the rain is very sharp. Relative to your car, the rain is traveling at an angle only about 18 degrees above horizontal (for those of you who are interested in the math, this is arctan(10/30)) at most. So the situation [looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/068FWWX.png) from the car's moving perspective.

Alcohol and tea has been one of human's earliest ways to avoid water borne diseases, and has been a significant driver of human genetics, and so I made the assumption that the evolutionary pressure could affect human behavior as well.

This is quite an old process, and in most circumstances is still done without any encryption - which basically means the employer can take a peek at it.  All other messages are sent encrypted (with HTTPS). This is that padlock icon in your browser, and it means that before sending anything, the browser and the server agreed to use a secret code so that noone else can read these messages.  However, some browsers (like Firefox (by the way you should totally switch to it it's really good)) can use DNS-over-HTTPS, which is the same encrypted connection to the DNS server. It's not the same level of security as using a VPN though, as they can still see that you're connecting to [172.217.13.238](https://172.217.13.238) and then do a reverse DNS lookup - that tells them you connected to some Google server, which could be anything.

    "answer": "This phenomenon varies between different food types. Put simply, as you chew, your saliva dissolves the food in your mouth to help you swallow it. The first thing your saliva touches is the outer layer of your food. In the case of prepared meals like steak and pasta, the main flavor is on the outermost layer of your food, as you chew and swallow the saliva in your mouth it takes the flavors (herbs, spices, salt, seared crust etc.) down with it and you taste more of the remaining meat or wheat in these examples, which don't taste as flavorful without that outer seasoning. This is also why if you don't like the flavor of broccoli or peas, they taste worse the more you chew them, since the seasoning washes down with your saliva and the vegetable taste starts coming out.  You'll notice that this doesn't happen with fruits, ice cream, or chocolate etc. since in those cases all layers of what you're eating have the same flavor.",

Every transaction/mining operation is verified by the entire network (everyone who is mining), so you'd need a majority of those people to be in on the scam in order to pull it off. If you report a different transaction than everyone else, your transaction gets discarded as \"incorrect\".  Centralized systems like banks use double-entry bookkeeping. That means that, for every addition to an account, there must either be a subtraction from another account (transferring funds) or a physical input (cashing a check or depositing cash). So the system admin would have to either fake transactions from real accounts (in which the owners would quickly find out) or try to fake a physical interaction (counterfeit money or a fraudulent check) in order to gain money for themselves.  It should be self-evident that, if you're making counterfeit money that can pass bank inspections, you're in a far different tier than hacking bank accounts.

    "question": "ELI5: What is the actual purpose of AC power?",
    "answer": "Electric generators and motors can use dc or ac, not both.  DC generators and motors need brushes to catch the power from the spinning part, and this brushes require big big maintenance. When AC was discovered, it allowed to make generators and motors at 2/3 of the price of a DC one, and they are completely maintenance free, because they don\u2019t need a brush system. So they won, and were adopted in mass.  Not having brushes allows to produce higher voltages without issues. Higher voltage allows to  transfer the same power using thinner wires, this makes transport and the generator parts to be done with thin cheaper wires, saving even more money.  Then the power transport in cables has losses along the line, electrons flow heats the cables, with high voltage, you can transport power by moving fewer electrons but with higher force in each of them. So again, another win for high voltage systems, and again high voltage production is easier if done in AC. There are DC high voltage lines, for example, submarine cables and nation to nation lines may be high voltage DC; not so common but it\u2019s done sometime, for example, a country with 115v 50hz AC may transform it to DC to sell it to another country that then transforms it into its own 220V 60hz AC. This is done because the 2 different AC systems are completely incompatible, because both need to transform it, they may have a DC line between them.  Add in that illumination can be done with DC or AC without difference.   Basically the only drawback for AC is computers. Computers need low voltage DC. So we use an AC line for everything, and transform it to low voltage DC only in the devices that need it. Another thing that can\u2019t work in AC are batteries, so any system that has a battery needs to be DC. This doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t do a AC system with a DC conversion between system and battery, sometime it\u2019s done, it\u2019s overly expensive but may be done.",

Judicial decrees include things like arrest warrants, bail terms, that sort of stuff. This means they hunt fugitives, which is probably where most of their video game involvement comes from.  Marshalls don't generally investigate the way that cops or the FBI do. A judicial decree is something given to a specific person, so there's no whodunit to solve. A Marshall would only be involved after someone else has taken care of that part.   They do have some peace-keeping and security roles like other law enforcement, but only in specific scope.

    "question": "ELI5: Why do we stutter even though we know exactly what we want to say?",
    "answer": "It's not my specialist subject at all, but I've read a couple of articles on the subject.  To make words come out of your mouth, there is a part of your brain that takes the \"words you want to say\" messages and controls the parts of your mouth, tongue, breathing and stuff to make the desired sounds come out of your mouth.  There is another part of the brain that deals with hearing and understanding.  That part of the brain takes sounds coming in your ears and identifies word sounds and constructs meaning out of them.  When you actually want to speak, both of these processes are working together.  In your brain you form the sequence of words you want to say, and send them to the \"make words come out of your mouth\" process.  At the same time the \"understanding language\" part of your brain is listening to the actual sounds coming out of your mouth and checking that the sounds it is hearing are a correct representation of what you wanted to say.  If it detects something going wrong, it interrupts the making words process and makes you go back a bit and do it again, but right this time.  For people who stammer, there is a mismatch in this process.  The \"detect a mistake and correct it\" process happens when it doesn't need to happen, and causes a stutter.  Of course once the first stutter happens, there is now a genuine mistake, so the process repeats, and you get caught in a loop of trying to correct the error caused by trying to correct the previous error.  It is well known that people who are prone to stuttering and stammering only do it in certain situations, for example if they are nervous or in certain emotional states, because in those situations, there is a different threshold for error tolerance.  If you are comfortable and with people you trust, your brain just doesn't care as much if it makes a bit of a mistake.  If you can't hear yourself speak, then you can't stammer because it breaks the feedback loop.  If you are singing, then a different process is taking place.  The brain deals with music and language separately.  If you listen to a song, for example, it is very often the case that you just don't follow the meaning of the lyrics because your brain is in \"music\" mode rather than \"language\" mode.  When you sing, the sound feedback is being handled by the music part of the brain, so the hypercorrection from the language part of the brain doesn't cause the undesirable interruptions.",

    "answer": "High impedance headphones are a result of the much thinner wires that make up the voice coils which drive the membrane in order to keep them as light as possible. These extremely thin wires are of much higher resistance because resistance is a function of the cross sectional area of a conductor. Because power is voltage squared divided by resistance you need more voltage to increase the effective output power which is what makes them \"harder\" to drive. If the output circuit isn't compensating the sound will just be much quieter.  Speakers on the other hand are about massive displacement of air. The lower the resistance, the more current, the more power at the same voltage, the more powerful an amplifier you need. So if you go down from 8ohms to 3ohms you've nearly tripled the amount of current those coils can handle so you need almost triple the power so you need a much higher wattage amp to drive the speaker.  In short, high end headphones require more voltage to drive them to compensate for the resistance of smaller wires while high end speakers allow more current due to the lower resistance of the wire.",
    "follow-up": "Aren't headphones also about the displacement of air though just on a much smaller scale compared to speakers? I understand the principle of greater resistance needing more voltage to get the same level output for headphones. I still don't understand why lowering the resistance means more input is needed for speakers though as this seems to be the exact opposite way to how headphones work? Surely 1 volt into headphones with a resistance of 30ohms is going to give a much louder output than headphones with a resistance of 300ohms, so why is it the other way around for speakers and a more powerful amplifier required?  Edit: just to add that I've played around with the calculator linked below to see if I can understand this. My amp is rated at 60w at 8ohms or 120w at 4ohms.   At 8ohms fed by 60 watts we get 2.73A and 21.9V. At 4ohms and 120w we get the same volts, but current has increased to 5.47A, so effectively doubled. A few questions on this then: Is the increase in current the reason why a better quality amp that can handle the higher current is needed at lower resistances even though it should be easier to push the current through and if so, why? Is the power going to the speakers determined by the number of volts being fed into them and in order to keep the voltage up as resistance decreases more current is needed? If I'm correct with both of these then why isn't current an issue with higher resistance headphones, or is it?   https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/electric/watt-volt-amp-calculator.html"

    "answer": "The fold in the eyelid you are describing is called the epicanthic fold. it's associated with greater levels of fat deposition around the eyeball, a feature that is the most prominent in native North Siberian, Aleutian and Inuit populations. The extra tissue is thought to provide greater insulation for the eye and sinuses from the effects of cold, especially from freezing winds, and to represent an adaptation to cold climates. That means that in extreme temperatures, their faces would be more protected from sub-zero temperatures which could freeze the nose, lips, eyelids and severely irritate and cause cold injuries to the sinuses. It has also been suggested that the fold itself may provide a level of protection from snow blindness. In extreme periods of cold, those who could see best in blinding sunlight reflecting off of snow and ice could hunt most successfully.  its appearance in peoples of Southeast Asia can be linked to possible descent from cold-adapted ancestors, its occurrence in various African peoples doesn't follow a cold-adaptive explanation for it appearing in the latter groups. The epicanthic fold found in the san African people has been tentatively linked to protection for the eye from the high levels of ultraviolet light found in desert and semi-desert areas. That's not dissimilar to an advantage in snow and ice covered environments. The ability to see clearly and without distortion from extreme sunlight in a parched, less vegetation-covered landscape with harsh sunlight that distorts the landscape would be a similar advantage.",

The FDA requires all medications to have an expiration date of no later than two years after the date of manufacture, regardless of how long the medicine actually stays good.  Many medications stay effective long after that, its mostly just a matter of trying it and seeing if it still works.  You just don't want to take more than whatever the normal dose is, even if it seems less effective, since some medications have a very low margin of safety and so taking 3 pills that are 75% effective as opposed to 2 that are 100% might put you over that, for example.  The FDA requires expired medications to be safe if you are taking no more than the maximum dose of them.  IE, if a medication says to take 2 pills it will *always* be safe to take 2 pills regardless of how expired the medication is.  Again, the worst thing that happens is it just does nothing.

    "answer": "A few different things can happen to make you constipated, and usually you have all of these things happening together in varying degrees:  Your gut motility (how much the walls are moving stuff through) slows down  You absorb too much water from your intestines into your blood  Your faeces become compacted and hard  Anything you eat that causes any of this to happen is what causes constipation.   Basically, it\u2019s anything low in fibre, high in sugar, and lacking fermentation.  Fibre increases faecal bulking, which stops your stool from becoming compact and hard.   It also draws water into your colon through *osmotic pressure* and encourages gut motility.  Fibre also feeds the natural microflora in your gut, which promotes gut health and further prevents constipation.   If your food is low in fibre, you have none of these benefits, and you are at risk of constipation.  If you eat a diet that has very little fermented food (cheese, yoghurt, kombucha, beer) then you also may become constipated.   These foods contain bacteria that help your intestines function.   They promote gut motility by irritating your gut lining.   They also help digest some of the food you eat and spit out things you need but can\u2019t make by yourself - things like vitamins.

The problem is that I can read a chapter and have no idea what I read. You could take the book away from me, ask me about some really important details, like a character's name, and I'd have no idea.   It's really frustrating to and it's why I don't read much.  When I'm reading, my eyes are scanning the words, I know the words make their way into my brain but since I'm usually day dreaming at the same time, the words from the book don't get processed. I don't know where they go, but it's not into my brain. The result is that when I notice myself doing it, I have to go back and start from the last thing I remember which usually means reading the same few pages or the same chapter multiple times.   I'd suggest comparing it trying to read with music playing, but I think more people than I realize can do that just fine. Personally, I can't. If there's music or a TV on, that's where my mind is, it's not involved in what I think I'm reading.

    "question": "ELI5 how does the IRS \"wash rule\" work?",
    "answer": "Put simply, the wash sale rule prohibits an investor from claiming a capital loss for tax purposes if they repurchase the stock or security within 30 days.1  Specifically, the IRS deems a transaction a wash sale if the investor does the following 30 days before or after a sale:  1. Purchases the same investment 2. Purchases a substantially similar investment 3. Enters into a contract to buy a similar investment 4. Acquires a similar stock for an IRA or Roth IRA  An Example  Imagine an investor unfortunate enough to purchase Lucent Technology stock when it was trading upwards of $70 per share. Over subsequent years before the firm disappeared through mergers and acquisitions, that investor watched accounting scandals, financial trouble, and sales meltdowns wipe the share price down to $1.3  Ever the enterprising baron, our investor realizes that if they sell their shares, they can report a capital loss and lower their tax burden. The problem? They believe that Lucent, or the firm that ultimately owns it, will rise from the ashes and return some of the market value which it has lost.  Suddenly, our investor gets a brilliant idea. During the last week of December, they call their broker with instructions to sell their shares in the telecom equipment supplier, locking in the capital loss. Three weeks later, during the first half of January, they ask their broker to repurchase those shares of Lucent. All is well in the world; they locked in the capital loss while holding onto the shares. Seems ingenious, right?  The wash sale rule, as you remember, does not allow an investor to claim a capital loss if they repurchase the investment within 30 days. In other words, unless the investor waits until the 30-day period has elapsed, they will not be able to write the off the loss.  There are ways around this, but let us assume the guy in the article didn't do that.  He sells his shares down at $1 in December, buys them back in the next year at nearly the same price, and the stock goes back up.  His 2019 taxes say he lost $5,000,000 and he got an $800,000 tax break, but in 2020, they went up to a total of $5,045,000 ($45,000 profit), but he gets penalized for the wash sale, and has to pay back the $800,000",

    "answer": "Put really simply, \"Internet of Things\" is the idea that a lot of devices we use could be exposed to and controlled by a network and that this could be a good thing.  For example, having a lamp connected to the internet sounds silly to begin with, but it lets you create a remote control for the lamp. It's not that remote controls for lamps don't already exist, but they tend to use radio signals or infrared and both of these have line of sight and range problems. Having web-enabled doodads in the house means you can check if you left the oven on from the store and, if so, turn it off. Or, if you see a great deal on a roast while shopping but it's kind of late, you can start the oven preheating before you leave. Or, if you plan to arrive home after dark, you don't have to *leave* lights on, you can turn them on when you approach from outside.   The \"how it works\" is a bit of a mess right now. A lot of devices use their own special \"language\". For example, my fridge has internet-related features, but I can only control it from a specific app the manufacturer makes. My thermostat is internet-enabled, but interfaces with Amazon Alexa so I have more choices about how to control it. But there are some other \"languages\" that are more open, and devices that use those can be controlled from a lot of different apps or other devices.  There are lots of rainbow-tinted unicorn fantasies about how great it would be if every device were internet enabled. But whether it's a good thing or not really comes down to who implements it, how they implement it, and what they do with it.  For example, it'd be GREAT if my fridge could tell me its inside temperature regularly and how long it's running. Then I could use programs to perform analysis and notice if it seems to be malfunctioning. Instead, the only thing I can really do with the app is change the set temperature or get an alarm if the door is open for too long. Even if it had the features I wanted, it speaks its own language to its own special app so I couldn't access the data in a way that lets me use it.   Alternatively, my thermostat has both Alexa control *and* an API that I can use to access its data. Because of that API, I can write programs to analyze the data for me. I use a program someone else wrote to keep track of how my A/C is performing and to help me understand if it needs maintenance. This is a good thing!   Obviously people are concerned about security. There's a long way to go on that front.   In theory, some day, I'll be able to run ONE application that manages all of my devices. Where we are now, that's a bit of a pipe dream. Google has its own thing, Amazon has its own thing, Apple has its own thing, and a dozen vendors have their own thing.

We still have wars to be sure, but, none on the scale of WWI or II. Too many nations are scared of what will happen if nuclear powers directly go to war.

    "answer": "It really depends on what type of plane your are talking about and the level of auto pilot that your plane has. But regardless yes it is more difficult than a car:  Controls: Steering is far more like a boat than like car only you have elevation as well. I'm sure other redditors will go into greater detail but your controls are far more complex and if you are relying on the auto pilot you need to understand how to read and program that specific autopilot exactly. You can't learn to fly a Boeing 737-400 and then go fly a Boeing 737-800 - you'd have to go specifically retrain (Boeing 737NG course).  Navigation: In a car you are driving on a road with road markings and road signs and nowadays with extremely an useful GPS lady to guide you along. A huge part of flying is navigating as there's no signs up in the air to guide you along. And with weather conditions you have to learn to navigate by instrumentation alone.  Radio: This is the reason I could never be a pilot - I do not understand what is being said over the radio and you cannot fly safely without having proper communication and radio discipline. You have to be listening closely at **all** times because there's no way to fly safely without listening out for air traffic control constantly.  Safety: If your aircraft experiences any problem in air you can't simple pull over and open the hood. Therefore every single of aspect of flying involves safety checks and doublechecks. And these are not things that you can skip like when you pull your car out in the morning and you don't checked for punctures. You must follow specific checklists each flight in particular order.",

    "answer": "The fold in the eyelid you are describing is called the epicanthic fold. it's associated with greater levels of fat deposition around the eyeball, a feature that is the most prominent in native North Siberian, Aleutian and Inuit populations. The extra tissue is thought to provide greater insulation for the eye and sinuses from the effects of cold, especially from freezing winds, and to represent an adaptation to cold climates. That means that in extreme temperatures, their faces would be more protected from sub-zero temperatures which could freeze the nose, lips, eyelids and severely irritate and cause cold injuries to the sinuses. It has also been suggested that the fold itself may provide a level of protection from snow blindness. In extreme periods of cold, those who could see best in blinding sunlight reflecting off of snow and ice could hunt most successfully.  its appearance in peoples of Southeast Asia can be linked to possible descent from cold-adapted ancestors, its occurrence in various African peoples doesn't follow a cold-adaptive explanation for it appearing in the latter groups. The epicanthic fold found in the san African people has been tentatively linked to protection for the eye from the high levels of ultraviolet light found in desert and semi-desert areas. That's not dissimilar to an advantage in snow and ice covered environments.

    "question": "ELI5 how does the IRS \"wash rule\" work?",
    "answer": "Put simply, the wash sale rule prohibits an investor from claiming a capital loss for tax purposes if they repurchase the stock or security within 30 days.1  Specifically, the IRS deems a transaction a wash sale if the investor does the following 30 days before or after a sale:  1. Purchases the same investment 2. Purchases a substantially similar investment 3. Enters into a contract to buy a similar investment 4. Acquires a similar stock for an IRA or Roth IRA  An Example  Imagine an investor unfortunate enough to purchase Lucent Technology stock when it was trading upwards of $70 per share. Over subsequent years before the firm disappeared through mergers and acquisitions, that investor watched accounting scandals, financial trouble, and sales meltdowns wipe the share price down to $1.3  Ever the enterprising baron, our investor realizes that if they sell their shares, they can report a capital loss and lower their tax burden. The problem? They believe that Lucent, or the firm that ultimately owns it, will rise from the ashes and return some of the market value which it has lost.  Suddenly, our investor gets a brilliant idea. During the last week of December, they call their broker with instructions to sell their shares in the telecom equipment supplier, locking in the capital loss. Three weeks later, during the first half of January, they ask their broker to repurchase those shares of Lucent. All is well in the world; they locked in the capital loss while holding onto the shares. Seems ingenious, right?  The wash sale rule, as you remember, does not allow an investor to claim a capital loss if they repurchase the investment within 30 days. In other words, unless the investor waits until the 30-day period has elapsed, they will not be able to write the off the loss.  There are ways around this, but let us assume the guy in the article didn't do that.  He sells his shares down at $1 in December, buys them back in the next year at nearly the same price, and the stock goes back up.  His 2019 taxes say he lost $5,000,000 and he got an $800,000 tax break, but in 2020, they went up to a total of $5,045,000 ($45,000 profit), but he gets penalized for the wash sale, and has to pay back the $800,000",

    "answer": "The major arguments that are actually valid are:  1. There is concern that it would cause drug prices to come down to a level where the incentive to develop innovative therapies wouldn't be as strong  2. The standard of care will go down due to cost control measures making it hard for hospitals to make the economics work  3. There is concern that patients/doctors will lose autonomy with regard to treatment options, and decisions will be made at a system level, not with a patient's best interests in mind.  HOWEVER, most of these have been shown to be questionable at best and are largely not good faith arguments. The current level of complexity in the US healthcare system makes it really easy to muddy the water around the issue, and the profit-generating elements in the healthcare space invest enormous sums lobbying against any threats to their profits.",

It is 14 miles even though 20 is a higher number than 14.  Similarly the units of currencies are mostly irrelevant and miss the point, you would need to talk about the average income in the countries and purchasing power parity.  Instead what is usually meant when referring to a currency as being strong is that there is a high and reliable demand for that currency. The US dollar is going to be able to be traded for valuables in the future, the US government isn't going to collapse or cause hyperinflation of the dollar. There is going to be a demand for USD because people will need it to purchase things in the future.

    "answer": "There are two ways you can write up the netcode for a game. You can either handle the button presses when they were originally pressed, or you can handle them when they get to the central server.  Let's say you're starting with the central server timing. This is also referred to as Delay-Based. If you press a button on your screen, until you receive an acknowledgement from the server that the button was pressed, nothing happens. This creates a lag that you have to overcome that just isn't present with in-person gaming, and is going to vary greatly depending on your connection at the time. However, everything you see on your screen is guaranteed to be what actually happens.  The other way, handling buttons based on when they were originally pushed, is what is referred to as rollback.  Imagine each button press gets sent to the server with a timestamp. Your local game can start playing the actions right away, because it expects that the server will accept that button press at that time.  When it gets to the server, it will look at the timestamp of the button press. If it has already done any calculations for any button presses later than that, then it rolls back those button presses, adds the new one, and then replays them, and sends the correction to both clients.  This means that you effectively always get your button press at the time you pressed it, without weird lag making it much later than you intended. This also means that, if there is substantial lag, you can see the game stutter as it corrects itself, but if there is very little lag, then everything appears very smooth for both players, making them feel as if it's a local game.",

    "answer": "The whites of your eyes have little to do with what you actually see. The pupil of your eyes is responsible for receiving light and transmitting it to the brain to be perceived as vision.  Squinting changes the angle of the lens of your eye overlying the pupil, causing light to be refracted differently to certain areas inside of your eye, some of which are better at detecting brightness of light, while others are better at detecting color and overall acuity (sharpness) of an image.   If you wear glasses for nearsightedness (trouble with distance vision), you can actually improve your distance vision slightly through squinting -- it bends the light in a way that partially corrects the lens abnormality in nearsightedness. If you only have a mild case of nearsightedness, squinting can almost correct it entirely (but will cause eye strain and other issues doing it all the time). All your glasses (or contact lenses) do in these situations is add another lens with a correction factor to cancel out what your lens isn't doing properly and hence correct your vision.",

    "answer": "Some people are better at memorising than others. Also, some people are better at reading sheet music than others. Personally, I find it much easier to read sheet music quickly than to memorise pieces.  Some classical musicians absolutely can memorise long and complicated pieces of music. However, it can be useful to have the sheet music in front of you just in case, even if you don't need to read it. For many classical musicians, the sheet music acts more like a quick memory jogger to remember what the next section is, so that you can then pour your effort into playing that as expressively as necessary.  There are definitely some instruments that are more difficult than others, but this can be for a variety of reasons. As a flautist, I can only play one note at a time, so it's arguably a much simpler instrument than piano or any stringed instrument. At the same time, I don't have as much option for relying on muscle memory. On the piano, you can get used to the way your hands move to play a phrase, and the same for guitar - but on the flute, there's not the same \"easy\" muscle memory for being able to play the next phrase without thinking about. (I'm sure a better flautist than I am might disagree with me about this, but I struggled with the muscle memory for playing phrases on the flute much more than I ever did with the keyboard, guitar, or drums.) As a result, the sheet music can be quite helpful as an aid when the muscle memory isn't as well developed for playing a piece.  Finally, it might just be down to convention and habit. Classical musicians almost always have their sheet music handy, so they almost always put it in front of them. Guitarists often practise without sheet music, so they don't feel as much need to put it in front of them.",

    "answer": "This hopefully counts as eli5 answer: gradients tell you how fast a thing changes. So you need two inputs: what is the thing you're looking at, and what's the knob you turn to make the thing change. Usually the first input is a number, or numbers, say, the temperatures of every key on your keyboard. There are typically two knobs to turn: the time knob or the \"space\" knob. They just return different gradients. The time knob will take only one key of the keyboard as input and will tell you how fast the current temperature of that key changes over time. Use another key as input, and you get the current change of temperature. This is a gradient over time, it will tell you how the input temperature changes at one point on the keyboard.  The other knob is the spatial knob. It takes as input the key again, but it will tell you how the temperature changes as you move from this key down, or left. So while the first gradient is change in temperature per minute, the second is change in temperature per inch. As such, a gradient can be used as prediction. If you know the current temperature of a key and the time-gradient, you can calculate roughly how warm the key will be in 3 minutes. And likely: if you know the spacial gradient, you can estimate how warm the key on the left is.  Edit: using time and space knobs are the most common  gradients. But there are more knobs, generally anything that has an influence on your input can be used as knob: everything else returns a very boring gradient that is 0 everywhere, no matter how much you turn that knob, your input doesn't change.",

    "question": "ELI5: How does a non-profit work?",
    "answer": "A non-profit has nothing to do with making profit. The name is misleading, they can, and absolutely do make profit and can have  a primary goal of profit. Non-profit is a terrible terrible misleading name. It's not about making profit, its about what you can do with that profit.  A non-profit is just a way to organize a business for tax purposes. Hard stop  The benefit of not being a non-profit, that is you are a regular business is that you can directly give your owners money and sell shares of the company.  A non-profit, really the only downside is you can't do that. The owner(s) of a non-profit can't just take money from the company. However, this is basically BS. Because in a non-profit, you can still pay wages, so you just hire your owner and pay them a wage, which is *exactly* what happens in many. You start a non-profit, and whether you work or not, you pay yourself a wage from their money.  Non-profits get significant tax benefits over traditional companies and that is the reason many businesses are organized that way. It is NOT about profit.",

A fuel-air mixture is drawn into the cylinder, compressed, then ignited; the force of the expanding gas as a result of that ignition drives the piston down and imparts energy to the crankshaft.  In a diesel engine, though, even if you let off the gas pedal, the engine will still draw a full charge of air into the cylinders, and that air acts as a spring; because the engine is still turning, it's still compressing the air, and the air then rebounds when the piston falls back down.  What a Jake brake does is it opens the exhaust valve as the piston reaches the top of the cylinder, bleeding some of that air off and robbing the crankshaft of power.",

    "answer": "The answer is: we're still trying to get there!  Sugar is easy to find for a few reasons.  1. Sugar is a small molecule who's shape is pretty consistent. This lets us design very effective receptors to interact with it in all environments (temp pH and salt content) The above isn't true for say proteins who's configurations are dependent on their local environment. Thus anything that interacts with them must do so under very controlled conditions. This might require either very specific environmental controls, or tedious preprocessing (preparation steps before measurement)  2. Sugar is relatively abundant to other species in your blood. Sugar exists on the order of magnitude of mmol/L in your blood. This is hundreds to hundreds of thousands of times higher than other relevant biomarkers. This is the difference of trying to measure the weight of a sandwich and the weight of the salt in the meat of the sandwich. The problems simply are not comparable. We also need more blood to be confident we will find something. 3. Diabetes is a massive market that provides financial incentive that has hugely oversaturated the sugar diagnostics market. If you're making a portable sensor, chances are that in the early stages, you're going to need a well known test case to compare your results to. Sugar measurement is a simple initial test. It's low hanging fruit for the reasons listed above. There are tons of comparison points. It's financially viable. Even if your goal is to diagnose cancer, at some point you will likely end up diagnosing sugar concentration.  There's no reason we can't make portable diagnostic devices that can measure protein and DNA concentrations, but it is simply harder to do than it is to measure sugar concentrations. We will get there one day.  tl;dr  Diagnostics is hard. Sugar is diagnostics on easy mode",

And when materials burn they emit different wavelengths of light based on their composition (called their \u201cEmission Spectra\u201d).  But planets are different.  They don\u2019t burn.

    "answer": "The heart is a muscle, and a strong muscle will always out perform a weak one. Aka, your heart will be better at circulating blood if it's in good shape, thus allowing more blood to get to \"injured\" places in the body, thus healing them faster.  Also, increased exercise causes decreased fat in the body. Fat clogs arteries making blood flow slower. Your body also has to work harder in general to support the extra weight. So, decrease your fat and you'll increase your performance in all areas.  Here's an example. Let's say your liver is damaged. It needs 100 blood cells per hour to heal. Your heart is only able to deliver 75 per hour because it's weak. On top of that you have fat, restricting blood flow, so that 75 cells goes down to 50. It will now take your liver twice as long to heal than if your heart was strong and you had less fat.",

Well you generally don't want your objects passing through each other so you want the game to detect when two objects have \"collided\" so you can have them do things like explode or bounce off of each other. So you write some code for this \"collision detection.\"  Well, just about every game in the world has objects for which we need to detect collisions. So rather than every game studio in the world independently coming up with their own collision detection code from scratch, I'm just going to sell them mine. Saves them time and makes me money.  But just doing collusion detection wouldn't be efficient. So we add in just about all the stuff that's common to all games, or all games of a certain genre. Like applying gravity to objects, code for rending objects into the images you see on the screen, determining line of sight, etc. etc.  Take all of those common and ubiquitous functions that are applicable to lots of different games and package it up and now you have a game engine.

    "answer": "The top 1% of taxpayers in the US account for 20% of the country's income and 40% of the country's taxes.  That ratio is consistent with what you would expect given the tax rates in the country.  Typically people who say that someone isn't paying taxes don't understand how taxes work.  Specifically, neither people nor corporations are taxed on revenue - everyone is only taxed on *income*, which is the amount of money you have left over to spend on yourself.  For low wealth individuals nearly 100% of the money you make is income because the only cost involved in you making money is your time.  But for high wealth individuals and corporations that isn't true.  If you have to pay someone else $100 so that they can earn you $150 then it doesn't make any sense to take you on that $150 in revenue, it only makes sense to tax you on the $50 in income that you actually made.    If you do tax on revenue then all you do is create a situation where people can't afford to both pay taxes and hire employees.  Imagine if you have to pay someone $100 to make $101.  If you get taxed on that $101 of revenue then you end up losing money on that, so no one would do it and its rare for anyone to have a profit margin higher than a few percent.  What this means is that just because someone or something has huge revenue doesn't mean that they have much income.  That is, just because Company X is making $50 billion per year doesn't mean that it has $50 billion per year to distribute to shareholders.  In reality it has far less than that, and its that disposable income that the company gets taxed on.

    "answer": "If I'm not mistaken, you're asking why in an enclosed are like a room, walls aren't always continuous but have columns sticking out. Is that it?  The answer is that, except in special cases, walls do not support anything (but their own weight), but columns do. This is why when you see a building being constructed, you see the frame (beams and columns) being built first, and then walls built later. This is why you sometimes see beams sticking out from the sides of the roof. In this case, we say that walls (called curtain walls) are not an active structural element: they do not contribute to the supporting frame. They're there like curtains: because nobody likes to live in a room with no walls (but they're also helpful in avoiding certain complex loads).  Slabs that make the floor are typically supported by the horizontal beams on the side (and sometimes columns when they're huge). Beams are supported by columns around the corners, and they're sometimes hidden. Columns are supported by the frame from the lower level, and so on..all the way to the foundations.

That's the part of the addiction that nicotine gum and patches can deal with.  The other part is habitual.

    "question": "ELI5: If solar panels can be put on the roof of a house into a battery for electricity, why cant/dont car manufacturers like tesla put it on the top of cars to have unlimited range?",
    "answer": "That is basically an age-old battle between power generation and power consumption.  For solar energy you need space and sun. Lots of it actually, and while in some countries the weather pattern is enough for solar generation, in many countries solar energy on a private site like a normal house can only supply X percentage of your daily / yearly consumption. This is of course still a major benefit, hence more and more buildings incorporate some kind of regenerative system (even only to reduce normal energy costs by a few percent).  For cars however this is a bit problematic, as the space on a car roof is simply way too small to generate energy to generate enough energy efficiently enough to power batteries ... not even considering tunnels, bad weather, being in a garage or roofed parking lot, inside the shadows of skyscrapers in a city or a forest etc. You can optimize your solar energy generation at your home. You cannot do that nearly as good for a car.  Now in theory they can at least supply a bit of energy, but the next issue would be the price. For a building costing hundreds of thousands of EUR the price for a solar system is relatively low (compared to the building price). For a car, the relative price would be much higher, noticeably increasing the cars price ... and e-cars are trying to make their way in an extremely competitive environment, where even a few hundred EUR can already influence the purchase decision of a buyer.   Last but not least: cars are designed in their form and looks with specific goals in mind (good looks, areodynamics etc). Commercial solar panels cannot (yet) be brought into the form necessary for a seamless integration in the often curved roof or an engine hood. There are some developments where solar cells can be formed like plastics, but IIRC they are still a bit out of range of normal, large scale, commercial use.  In the end solar generation integrated into the hull of a vehicle will be coming, but only to supply some additional energy for onboard equipment like radios, lights etc.  SYL",

    "question": "Eli5: what happens to medication and medical supplies after it's expectation date?",
    "answer": "The medication just breaks down and is less effective.  The FDA requires all medications to have an expiration date of no later than two years after the date of manufacture, regardless of how long the medicine actually stays good.  Many medications stay effective long after that, its mostly just a matter of trying it and seeing if it still works.  You just don't want to take more than whatever the normal dose is, even if it seems less effective, since some medications have a very low margin of safety and so taking 3 pills that are 75% effective as opposed to 2 that are 100% might put you over that, for example.  The FDA requires expired medications to be safe if you are taking no more than the maximum dose of them.  IE, if a medication says to take 2 pills it will *always* be safe to take 2 pills regardless of how expired the medication is.  Again, the worst thing that happens is it just does nothing.  There are a handful of exceptions to this, all of which are drugs used to treat very rare conditions and which come with a prominent warning that they can become poisonous as they age.",

    "answer": "There are actually many genes involved in balding, some connected to the x chromosome and some the y. The main baldness  gene is found to be on the maternal x chromosome. So if you are male, you inherited your x chromosome from your mom. So the likelihood of you becoming bald is fairly high if your mom's dad was bald. But remember your mom has two x chromosomes so she may not have passed on the gene to her male child.  The male child may have gotten the mom's x chromosome that doesn't carry the gene. So just because your mom's dad is bald doesn't mean you will be but your chances are higher. Now if your y chromosome,  which you get from your dad, carries one of those other baldness genes NOT related to the x chromosome,  you still have a chance of being bald even if you did not inherit your mother's chromosome that has the main baldness gene. So, If your maternal grandfather is bald you have a high likelihood of going bald. If your dad is bald too, you have an even higher chance of being bald because he may be bald due to a gene on his Y chromosome that causes baldness.",

So whenever oxygen levels dipped, insect sizes changed to adapt -- and no lungs were needed.

    "question": "eli5 Can someone explain me what is a musical scale?",
    "answer": "A musical scale is a series of notes that repeat after an octave. Scales in western music usually have 7 notes, with the eighth being an octave of the first note. An octave is just two notes that sound the same, but one sounds \"higher\" than the other.  In western music, there are 12 notes that repeat: A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, then it starts repeating with A again. [Here's a picture to show how the notes are arranged on part of a piano keyboard](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3c/83/a7/3c83a794158355fe0e58232d9ce56e34.jpg). The # and \u266d note names (the names of the black keys) are interchangeable.  When you play a scale, you aren't playing all the notes. To simplify a lot, some notes just *sound better* when you group them together. If you were to just play all the notes, it might sound like chaos.  For instance, the most common scale in western music is the major scale. You can pick any note and play a major scale starting with that note. If you pick the major scale starting on C, the notes will be C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. If you pick the G major scale, the notes will be G, A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. To figure it out yourself, use this pattern: you can pick a note (call it the *root note* of the scale), then move up the keyboard (to the right) by this set of steps: skip a note, skip a note, don't skip a note, skip a note, skip a note, skip a note, don't skip a note. And that's a major scale.  If you were to \"play in a scale\", you can play any of the notes in that scale in whatever order you want, and they'll \"sound good\" with anyone else playing in that scale.  There are a lot of different kind of scales, and using them in different ways, in combination with each other, helps us to make interesting songs, based on the basic concept of tension and release.",

    "question": "ELI5 why hand prosthetics are so challenging to create?",
    "answer": "The one of the most important things to think about when designing a prosthetic (after safety) is how you are going to control it. It might initially seem like, \"we have things like bluetooth, so why is this hard?\" but think about where that signal is coming from in the first place. One of the simplest ways we did prosthetics was by coupling it to motion of another joint. For instance, if you raise your shoulder, your hand closes. Lower your shoulder again and it opens. Obviously, this is very mechanical.   For more advanced methods, we can look at the nerves in your arm. There are three main nerves, but each of these give off branches to different muscles, and we aren't skilled enough to directly measure signals going directly to all ~25 muscles in the forearm and hand. One thing we can do, though, is cheat. Instead of looking for a small nerve, we can put a chip in the region of your brain that sends signals to the hand. The problem here is that we still can't pinpoint a signal. We can train you to use it better, but it is like learning to walk all over again... with the extra difficulty of your muscles don't work properly.  So what is the absolute easiest way to deal with all of these problems? Simple - limit the function of the hand. While we can't get each nerve signal, we can measure signals in the larger nerves. Your hand wont have the dexterity of a slight-of-hand artist, but we can restore *some* of the lost function, which is preferable to none.",

    "answer": "There's a lot of hardware that you'll pass through, and most of it you have no way of even knowing.  You can only find out *approximately* how many routers your packet touches on the way to its destination because of a fancy hack of setting the TTL to various incrementing values(which decrements with each router until it reaches 0 to prevent routing loops), and getting TTL Expiry messages back from the router that sent them.  However, that doesn't even tell you the number of routers, since technologies like MPLS let a service provider create a pseudo-routing-shortcut through their network from one edge to another, which can bypass the TTL mechanism in the intermediary steps.  Then you have various switches and signal boosters along the way, which are also going to be transparent.   At the same time, you could be going through \"virtual\" devices. You could have a packet go into a Layer 3 Switch on one Virtual LAN (VLAN), which passes between two Layer 3 Routers within the switch, and then out another VLAN on the switch.

This means that internal parts don't have to adjust individually, and to boot, it is highly easy to transform AC into DC, via the use of diodes/resistors and often capacitors to deal with the drop in power that comes from the AC source.  AC is easier to transport across large distance, as it basically loses less strength (Voltage) over longer cabling. Even great conductors like copper have some resistance, so that particularity of AC is important. It is also used by most appliances that don't necessarily ***need*** DC, such as refrigerators, or dryers.  Basically you want DC when you need efficiency, you want AC when you want distance, but this is am excessively dumbed down version.

Absurdism is the philosophical position of addressing the problem of meaninglessness by just having your own meaning and reveling in its absurdity.  Nietzsche suggested dealing with the existential threat of nihilism (a byproduct of the death of God) by rising above one's own humanity and creating one's own meaning (as one's own god).

Because of privacy concerns the use of such cookies to identify people has been curtailed a bit in recent times.   Another way to track people is by their IP address, but most people on the Internet automatically get a different IP address every day, so that is of limited use.  However when your browser talks to a web-server its ends out all sorts of information about itself to the server to get a better browsing experience.  These information may include, the name and version of the webbrwoser program and OS, the preferred language of the user, installed fonts or screen resolution.  Any single one of them is not all that useful. However the combination of these various bits of information can narrow it down quite a bit.  By using as many different dat points as possible you can create a unique signature for a visitor, a fingerprint so to speak.

    "answer": "Back in the day, a video game came on physical media and shops would have a limited stock on the day it was released. To ensure you could play it on day 1, you would \"pre-order\" your copy of the game to reserve it at the shop and go collect it on the day.   Knowing how many pre-orders there were helped game companies gauge the sort of popularity the game would have. Lots of useful information for them, and money in the bank.   The downside for consumers was that reviews for the game would come out after people had bought the game, so if it wasn't all that good, it was too late for those buyers unless they went through the hassle of refunding it.    These days, there is no physical disc. Games are bought and installed off of the internet. Steam or PSN or Xbox live have unlimited copies to sell the moment the clock hits 00:00. There is no benefit for the consumer to pre-order. They can buy whenever. There is only the aforementioned downside.

But once any part of you is consciously aware of the fact that you are sleeping, it becomes much more difficult to remain asleep. At that point any aggressive change in the status quo of the dream is likely to jar you awake.

    "answer": "Lots of eli12 in this thread.  I'll take a stab at lowering that to 5  'grounding' is basically needed to ensure that everything is at the same 'electrical level' (voltage).The hazard of not grounding something is that if the electrical level (voltage) is different in one place compared to another and you touch both, it becomes level by going through you (not good). So as long as everything you touch is all the same level it won't go through you because there is nowhere for it to go. As long as everything in the ISS is all connected to the frame so that it is all the same level (voltage) you are safe.  This is why if a utility truck touches a power line and a worker gets out and touches the truck (high level/voltage) and the ground (low level/voltage) at the same time the electricity goes through their body and shocks them badly. If their co-worker JUMPS onto the ground and is never the bridge between the two levels (voltages) at the same time, they will be safe.  The important thing isn't dirt, it's that everything is the same 'level' of electrified.",

    "question": "Eli5: why is there no test for the \u201cchemical imbalance\u201d that is often mentioned for depression?",
    "answer": "If it\u2019s any similar to some other hormones like the HPA axis, it\u2019s because there\u2019s only a very low amount of that chemical circulating in your body at a time. Most of it is produced in your brain and used a very short distance \u2018downstream\u2019 from there, which effectively leads to undetectable amounts in the wider circulation. So if you took a blood sample from someone\u2019s arm like we normally do, you would hardly detect the chemical, let alone be able to tell if there\u2019s an imbalance. You\u2019d have to take a blood sample inside the brain between the two specific points where the chemical is produced and absorbed again, to be able to tell anything at all.  That being said, things like depression or adhd are usually caused by neurotransmitter problems. They are molecules that you find in the brain and that allow one neurone to communicate with the next, but they are not found in blood much at all. So again you\u2019d have to somehow sample the connection between two neurones to measure the amount of neurotransmitter.  An easier way to do it is to monitor the effect of drugs that affect neurotransmitters. If you give them SSRIs (serotonin reuptake inhibitors), what you are doing is forcing serotonin to be present for a longer time before it is reabsorbed, thereby making sure the signal travels correctly from one neurone to the next. Normal people will react differently to the drug compared to depressed people with a serotonin deficiency as it were. Compare it to to adhd meds: normal people on adderall act all high, while people with adhd on adderall are able to calm down",

    "question": "ELI5: Why is the ground wire called \"ground\" when it goes back to the source and not into the ground?",
    "answer": "That's not entirely correct. The ground wire is not an alternative neutral wire for safety. It does not go back into the main grid. (even though it is usually connected with the neutral) It goes into the ground connector to form a solid connection with the earth.   The diffirence between the neutral and the ground is that the neutral goes back to the source where the electricity is created. Thus, the powerplants generator. Whereas the ground literally goes to a big rod inserted into the Earth.   The point of the Ground wire, besides to prevent against electrocution if metal objects get energised because of a fault, like you correctly said, is actually to act as a common refference and equalising point for all electrical systems and measurements.  Ground is basically the closest thing we have as a \"zero\" for electrical potential, so it's very useful for measuring with. It's also important for our safety that our electrical systems are equalised with ground, because it's the closest to the electrical potential that us humans are at, because we're always standing on it.   It also helps prevent against interferance or issues when you connect two circuits with their own powersource together. Because electrical potential is a very local thing. So two independent isolated battery powered circuits that are both reading 24 volts across their poles, might actually have two entirely diffirent amounts of electrical potential when compared to eachother. So by connecting them both to ground you create a sort of soft electrical connection between the two circuits that equalises them to one another so they'll play nice together, without the chance of interferance or damage.",

This lets the webserver effectively track you between requests, which are needed for things like a logged-in session.   One important thing with a cookie is that it belongs to one domain name. Your reddit.com cookies don't get sent to a request to google.com. However, there are things *in* pages.  If you see a \"Share to Facebook\" or \"Like us on Facebook\" icon on a page, that image is going to be hosted on Facebook's servers. When you load the page, your browser is going to see the reference to that image and request it as well.  When your browser requests that image, it also includes something called a Referrer URL in the metadata. This is the URL of the page that is asking your browser to fetch that image. It's also going to include the cookies for *Facebook* since that's the server it's requesting from.  This means Facebook can track you based on your cookie values, and they know where you're browsing, based on the Referrer URLs.

    "question": "ELI5 If time is a dimension, why can you only go in one direction?",
    "answer": "Ok, so this is far from a fully accepted theory, but it *is* a theory, and based off some very well-accepted theories.   In General Relativity, you don\u2019t really \u201cmove\u201d through time. Instead, you *are* at all points in time.   As an example with lower dimensions so we can understand it intuitively, imagine a pen moving left and right. Then, as time progresses, you move the page downward under the pen, leaving a line on that page.   The left/right position of that line on the paper represents the spacial position of the pen, while the up/down position represents the temporal position of the pen.   If you look at a single horizontal slice of that line, and you move the horizontal slice upwards at a steady rate, you will see what *looks* like a point moving left and right, imitating the path that your pen took.   But you know that the horizontal slice giving the motion of the pen is actually only a slice of the full picture. In fact, the ink of the pen makes a full line. It just *exists* in both time and space. It\u2019s not moving, it\u2019s not going forward or backward, it\u2019s just a line sitting there.   The only way to see motion from this line is by only looking at a single moving slice - a single moment in time - at any given instant.   This is what happens in real life. You are a 4-dimensional, static line through spacetime. The reason you seem to move, think, and be dynamic in any way is because you\u2019re experiencing a single slice of time, a single instant in your \u201cworldline\u201d (that\u2019s the real name for it), and that slice of time you experience is moving forward through time at 1 second per second.   Ok, but here\u2019s where it gets really weird.   How do you know that you\u2019re progressing through time? You\u2019re only ever living in the exact present, it\u2019s not like you have a sense that tells you time is passing, so how do you know it is?  Generally, the response is that you remember all the past instants in time, right? That layer of recent memories tells you you\u2019re moving through time, forming new memories.   But (assuming we accept that memories are due to some arrangement of matter in your brain, and not caused by magic or spirits or whatever), there\u2019s absolutely no way for you to differentiate between actually progressing through time and developing new memories, or just being a static entity that can\u2019t move, or do anything, that\u2019s stuck in a single instant in time, but with memories from all the previous instants.   Essentially, the idea is you aren\u2019t moving through time, you\u2019re stuck in this exact moment, but with the *memories* in your brain telling you that you are moving through time.   So now, the question isn\u2019t \u201cwhy are we only moving in one direction through time\u201d because in fact, you aren\u2019t moving through time at all. You\u2019re just a single static slice of your 4-dimensional worldline with the memories making you *think* you\u2019re moving through time. Rather, the question is \u201cwhy do we only remember the past, and not the future\u201d.   And the general idea for that is because of entropy. Let\u2019s pretend that your brain is a watermelon, and you\u2019re trying to remember a hammer that\u2019s coming to smash that watermelon.   Now, theoretically, it\u2019s within the laws of physics for a smashed watermelon to spontaneously bounce off the ground, join together, and throw a hammer into the air. It\u2019s *possible*, but insanely unlikely, because every one of billions of trillions of particles would have to vibrate in exactly the right way at the right time to accomplish that.   On the other hand, it\u2019s *very* likely for a watermelon hit by a hammer to spontaneously smash. That\u2019s something that increases entropy, and you have common sense to realize that would happen.   So, if we see a smashed watermelon, we can pretty easily conclude, \u201chey, a hammer probably hit this\u201d. If we see an *unsmashed* watermelon though, you can\u2019t conclude \u201cthis watermelon probably solidified from many small chunks of watermelon on the ground and threw a hammer into the air\u201d.   In a way, you can say a smashed watermelon \u201cremembers\u201d into the past that it was hit by a hammer.   On the other hand, a solid watermelon can\u2019t \u201cremember\u201d into the future that it *will be* smashed, because the probability that a solid, unsmashed watermelon corresponds to being hit by a hammer in the future is so vanishingly small.   Your brain is basically that watermelon. It can\u2019t remember into the future because it\u2019s so insanely unlikely that a brain affected by the future would somehow reverse every process required to, for example, erase a memory, send the signal back down the optic nerve, causing your cones to yeet out photons into space.   **TL;DR:** *You don\u2019t move through time at all, you\u2019re stuck in time with memory of the past.

    "question": "ELI5 What is universal healthcare?",
    "answer": "Commonly referred to a socialized medicine. Essentialy government run, tax funded single-payer healthcare system.   Most European and lots of asian countries have various spins on this. A familiar example might be Canada. Each province (state) has a provincial healthcare body that runs all of the hospitals, pays for all the doctors, nurses, MRI machines etc. Resources are funded and allocated where the demand is. i.e. a hospital in a growing city gets more doctors and machines and testing labs etc.   So unlike in the US, where healthcare is paid for almost entirely by private healthcare insurance plans, along with huge deductibles where patients have to pay out of pocket, in Canada (for example), you just rock up to the hospital with a broken leg, wait until its your turn, leg gets an x-ray, reset, a cast and you go home. Most you'll have to pay for is parking at the hospital and a drink from the ER vending machine.   The criticism is that for non-critical procedures and injuries, depending on priority you can wait some time for your \"free\" healthcare. Its not uncommon to be in the ER room of a hospital with a broken bone for 3-4 hrs. Its not uncommon to have a several month waitlist for joint replacement surgery. You might have to wait a few days or a few weeks for an MRI or some type of test. But its all done on a priority basis. Mostly. But its free (as in paid for by everyone's taxes).  Comparatively, in the US, you rock up to a hospital and you get an x-ray, pain killers, see a doctor, have a cast set all within an hour.

    "answer": "There would be no way to route traffic efficiently without IP addressing.  The only way it's done efficiently is by knowing based on network address where to route your traffic.  Think of it more like sending something in the mail, vs a phone book.  You need multiple pieces of information to get it to the right place right?  You need Zip Code (US), State, City, Street Address, and Person.  You mail that piece of mail from one side of the US to another, the first thing they do is look at that information to determine how it's going to get to it's destination.  You can't just put a name on there, as there is no way for the mail service to know that name out of the 300 million people living in the US.  So they start with ZIP code (which is really smaller than state), then narrow it down by street address, then eventually when it gets into your mailbox your wife hands you the mail because it ends up with your name on it.  Same way IPs work.  The numbers are not just randomly assigned.  Network address space is reserved by classes.  And routing tables know where those addresses are assigned to.  We know that everything 8.x.x.x is going somewhere, and everything that 9.x.x.x is going somewhere.  Then, as it gets closer to the destination, we use the additional digits to pinpoint where it's going until we get to the last digit and then we have the server.  Also, its VERY important to know, that name does not equal 1 server or IP address.  For example, when you go to [google.com](https://google.com) you go to 10000s of servers, not just a single server with a single IP address.  Also, for smaller setups, 1 server can house multiple IP addresses.  I have 5 domain names hosted on a single IP address.  That's why you can't just go to a name.  Really the name gets resolved to an address (or one in a pool of addresses), and then when you hit that server your browser says \"Hey, I'm trying to get to [myfavoritedomain.com](https://myfavoritedomain.com)\" and the web server serves it up.",

    "answer": "Your whole body actually prefers to sleep a bit cold. Studies have shown that keeping your thermostat at about 65 degrees Fahrenheit is optimal for the deepest sleep. Also, apparently keeping a cool head allows your body to expel heat more effectively (understandably). Since keeping your body warm takes energy and sort of defeats the purpose of sleep (that being to rest), we can imagine why we want to expel this heat. The body temperature we keep while awake is such because our chemical reactions and electrical signals in our body happen most efficiently at these temperatures. We don\u2019t really need to be think and act while asleep, so this conservation of energy while resting makes sense.   So body saves energy and rests easier by being a bit colder. Keeping a cool head is important to expel heat.    Aome anecdotal notes: Actually, for me I quite like my body at the same temperature as my head, it just makes me feel safe and relaxed to be covered, so I continue to sleep with a blanket. Additionally, my hands and feet are often *colder* than my head, so I also sometimes use my blanket to warm them up to the comfortable temperature my head is at, not past it to be warmer.     My really quickly gathered sources I\u2019m not an expert I just made a quick google search to back up my ideas:  https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/best-temperature-for-sleep  https://rem-fit.co.uk/blog/why-do-you-prefer-the-cold-side-of-the-pillow",

    "question": "ELI5: Since it rains diamonds on Saturn and Jupiter, do the diamonds just pile on each other? Do they evaporate?",
    "answer": "The gas giant planets are incredibly hot inside.  They have an enormous, rocky core, the surface of which is closer to a volcano than the earth's crust.  It's covered with an ocean of liquid gas that consantly boiling away then raining down again. Anything that falls to the surface is boiled and returns to the upper atmosphere.  The problem with the diamond rain is that it's theoretical. The presence of it depends on how convective the lower atmosphere and oceans are.  If they're highly convective then the diamonds will mix with oxygen and burn to create Co2. Eventually, all the carbon will be burned this way and there'll be no diamond rain.  If they're more evenly layered, or if a thick layer of hot gas is preventing the liquid ocean from coming into contact with the molten surface, then the diamonds will fall into the lava and boil away without getting the chance to bond with any oxygen.  AFAIK, we don't know which of these is true. We don't even know how thick the atmospheres are or how big or hot the rocky cores are.",

This process will see them emit one of three types of radiation depending on the element in question. You can see alpha, beta, or gamma decay. Alpha and beta are emissions of protons and helium nucleus. Gamma is an emission of very high energy light.   Radio waves are a form of very low energy light. Even though it is light like gamma it doesn\u2019t carry enough energy to knock electrons out of place (this is called Ionization) thus making it pretty much harmless. The spectrum of light goes from radio to microwave to infa red to visible to ultra violet to gamma. Only when you get to UV will the light have enough energy to do real damage.   As to why they are named that way I have no idea. Also this is more physics than chemistry in terms of the flair.",

    "answer": "A Discord server is a community. People can chat in different channels. Different channels have different names, and are used for different things. They can also have different rules. However, they are all in one server.   Roles are just, a role I guess. It's quite hard to explain. When clicking on a member on the right, you can see their roles. You can also mention an entire role (mention the members with the role) if the settings of the server allows it.   You can DM people in your server if, again, if the owner allows to do it. They can turn it on or off in the settings. If you DM someone, leave the server, and don't have any mutual servers, you can not DM that person.   You can send a friend request with the \"Add Friend\" button and entering the username and the user's discriminator with the following format:   <username>#<tag>   They must accept the request. Once you friend someone, no matter if they share a mutual server or not, you can DM with him.    Verified Discord servers mean that Discord officially verifies it. It is not very common of course, as you have to apply for verifying your server.   You can create your own server for free, and invite people with the \"Invite people\" button. You can create a one time use, make it valid for a day, and do stuff like that.    You can only join 100 servers though. If you try to join a server, the server invite will display as \"Invite Expired\".   Nitro is the \"premium\" version of Discord. In a server, the owner can upload custom emojis for the members to use. However, you can only use a emoji in that server. With nitro, you can use the emojis from a server anywhere, from your DMs to other servers. Nitro also allows you to use animated emojis.   If you have any other questions, tell me. :)",

I have been in their collection centers and rent payroll and equipment is not that much.",
    "follow-up": "Like others said, the cost breakdown of that unit is immense. As a patient here's what you're paying for for it:  Serological testing to make sure that it's free of HIV, Syphilis, T. Cruzi, HBV, HCV, HAV, and numerous other agents.  Blood bank testing to ensure complete accuracy that that unit is for sure a specific blood type (and in some cases that unit will be processed for further antigens which can get really pricey REALLY fast. I'm talking like $60-70 a drop of reagent). Need it irradiated or leukocyte reduced? That's more processing that needs to be done.  Processing of the unit in a safe clean environment to make sure the unit is properly separated with all the cellular components intact.  Paying for the transport of the unit through a courier that will ensure the unit is kept in a strict temperature range for storage.  Paying for the medical lab personnel to test the unit again, test your own blood to ensure compatibility, and to issue the unit.  Paying for the nursing staff to physically administer the unit to you and make sure you dont have a transfusion reaction.   Needless to say there's many other things that get factored into the price of the unit, and oh boy do some of those units get VERY pricey. But that's a veeeeery general breakdown. While equipment and payroll themselves may not be very expensive for the blood collection center you've been in, there's tons of moving parts to ensure that you get a safe blood product. And once you're in the lab itself the payroll and equipment gets significantly higher as you're paying for years and years of education and training in that staff.

You can only have one heart because of the way your body is laid out.  Your heart is kinda in the middle-ish of your body, and all of your blood *has* to go to your heart, make a detour through your lungs to pick up oxygen, and then swish around your body to drop the oxygen off.   If you had two hearts, this carefully-choreographed system just wouldn\u2019t work.  But kidneys.   Kidneys are special.  They\u2019re unusual.   They kinda just float in your abdomen, at the back.   Some people only have one, and some people have three naturally.  It doesn\u2019t make much difference.   Weird, right?  Kidneys filter your blood.   All your blood passes through them, and they push out the excess water and salt, and other dissolved waste products.   This trickles down into your bladder and you pee it out.  Now, you can pretty much attach as many of these kidney tubes as you like to your bladder.   So if a kidney still has some function, there is no reason to cut it out.   It\u2019s helping, even if it is not enough by itself to keep a person alive.   In a person with kidney problems, it\u2019s pertinent to give them every bit of help possible.

Third, Employers are desperate for workers, so potential employees are using that to their advantage to try and get employers to pay higher wages. This has happened in the past - workers demanding higher wages - except this time, the people actually have the advantage, due to being in high demand.   From an economic standpoint, look at is as supply and demand or the concept that scarcity increases the value of goods. Under current conditions/pay rates, employees are currently both in high demand and scarce. Many employers aren't giving into the demands (raising wages) so they can't obtain full staffing.

    "answer": "A cancer cell is just a regular cell with imperfectly copied or damaged DNA.  Most often, that damage means the cell won't be able to survive and perform its function and the cell dies (or is killed by the immune system) without causing any harm.  Sometimes, the DNA damage causes the cell to survive, grow, and reproduce uncontrollably, potentially spreading to other areas of the body.  At this point, the cells are considered cancerous and can grow and multiply to form tumors, ignore signals to stop growing, redirect bloodflow from the body to keep themselves growing, 'hide' from the immune system by appearing to be healthy, and potentially move into new areas of the body.  The damage to the DNA can come from any number of sources, from a simple mistake in making a copy to direct damage from UV radiation to carcinogenic chemicals that enter the cell and cause damage.",

    "answer": "Maps tend to be split up using grids, which work just like the graphs you've seen in maths - A bunch of numbers along the bottom as your X axis and a bunch of numbers up the side as your Y axis. Those grid lines are then subdivided further. The purpose of doing this is so that you can just give someone an X and a Y coordinate on that grid instead of having to tell them to look through the entire map until they find a particular notable feature.  For a quick example, let's say we were looking at [this map](https://bam.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/zqc2n39/small). You were trying to find the tourist information centre and you're so dumb you can't find it on a one-building map. I could tell you that it's in the top left square, but that's not helpful at all. There are four entire squares here! So instead, I tell you it's in 47,33. That lets you know right away which square it's in. You just follow the X axis along until you get to square 47, and follow the Y axis up until you get to square 33, and now you know exactly which square it is!   But it turns out you're actually so dumb that even knowing the square it's in, you still can't find it. In that case, I could tell you it's at 476,334. The last digit of each of those is like a decimal. So you go along to square 47,33 again like last time, but now you know you need to count 6 decimal places along the X axis and 4 up the Y axis, and you now know not just which building the tourist information is, but also the exact part of that building.  The same principle works for massive maps too, only those maps are so big that finding the tourist information without the coordinates could actually be difficult. There might be ten thousand squares on a big map which would be very impractical to search through one by one.   Coordinates only work for specific maps. Each map will have its own coordinate system, which will depend on the scale of the map, the scale of the grid, and where the map places its 0,0 point - one map that puts it on a particular lake will have different coordinates to another map that puts it a mile south of that lake. The humans of Earth happen to have decided on another map system though - latitude and longitude. These work pretty similarly to grind coordinates, but cover the entire globe. The idea of these is that because they use a universal system - angles away from an arbitrary centre-point - as opposed to arbitrary distances away from an arbitrary centre point, anyone can locate anything on Earth just by knowing how angles work and where the arbitrary centre point is, and if more precision is needed, a new decimal place can be added without needing to change any of the scales of the map.",

It seems to me that this is less secure than an old chipless card that at least requires a PIN.",
    "answer": "The chip and/or the PIN are a means of verifying the transaction is legit.  On a card without the chip, the only data is its number, the expiration date, and maybe the verification code on the back. The magnetic stripe is usually just the card number. These kinds of terminals require the PIN because (hopefully) only the authorized cardholder knows that PIN. These cards are easy to duplicate so we NEED extra security measures.  Cards with a chip, on the other hand, are a lot harder to replicate. The chip is actually a tiny computer that does some math on some inputs and generates numbers in a way that isn't easy to guess even if you see it done for a few thousand inputs. The bank who issues the card knows the secret information that makes it possible to predict the numbers. So, oversimplified, when you use a chip reader, the terminal gives the chip some inputs, gets the chip's result, then sends the inputs and the results to the bank. The bank verifies that the inputs should produce that output on your chip. So in a way, the chip IS the PIN, but it's more secure than that because you can't accidentally give someone knowledge that makes them able to replicate your chip.  It's probably possible to copy a card with a chip, but it would take a high degree of sophistication and someone would have to physically steal your card to do it. You can't reproduce the chip from observing a single read, and in theory even seeing hundreds of thousands of input/output wouldn't be useful. Because it's incredibly close to impossible to duplicate these chips, when a terminal uses the chip as an ID you don't have to use a PIN. The assumption is it means someone would've had to have stolen your actual card and you'd probably notice that much more quickly than it takes to figure out someone's skimmed a traditional card.",

A large airline has large reserves of pilots and aircraft in case of a breakdown or delays leading to cascading issues in on time departures. Small airlines have few planes in reserve and fewer pilots.  A cheap airline simply won\u2019t fly a new plane in as it would be far too expense to justify. Budget air survives on margins, and flying empty planes and new crews in doesn\u2019t make economic sense if your airline isn\u2019t based in customer service.

A similar technique worked for usb, but eventually more security was added to the computer firmware to prevent these types of attacks, at least with the default settings.             Protocol attacks rely on the host controller not properly error checking data from the device, so the device can fool the host machine into overrunning buffers, resetting important variables, or even jumping to code.             As an aside, there are also malicious USB sticks that use capacitors to build up an electrical charge and simply destroy the USB port and possibly the entire motherboard.

    "answer": "Your TV provider literally points a satellite dish at the appropriate satellite or has a direct digital feed from the transmission suite. When I say direct, they pay internet backbone companies to provide a high speed, multi routed feed between the sites.  As an aside ...  I've been in the transmission suite at the Atlanta studio of CNN international although it was many years ago.  The signal from the studio was piped over to the dish farm next to the Turner \"Mansion\" and transmitted to various satellites from there.  For my work we were using the Intelsat uplink and the corresponding downlink in the UK at Madley. At the downlink it used to then be bounced up to the Astra satellite constellation for Europe.  So while a great deal will have changed since then, the studio signal will still follow a similar path as it did then. The delay from the studio to a TV in Europe was about a second.  The London studio feed was sent to Atlanta in a similar way, but was piped to an uplink in London using a high speed, dedicated connection. These days your home broadband is many times faster than what was used, but even 4k signals aren't that bandwidth hungry really.  The London feed would be mixed in at the studio in Atlanta, so the delay could be a couple of seconds if you were watching a TV in London while standing in the London studio. It was an odd experience.  All the feeds are backed up with alternate systems in case of failure. Although the London studio feed was cut off once when a backhoe dug through both primary and alternate fibres on the route to the uplink. They used another physical route for the alternate feed after that.  Happy days.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why is the economic middle class shrinking?",
    "answer": "Concentrating wealth is what a capitalist economic system is set up to do. Imagine you're Jeff Bezos. You have one high level goal in running Amazon - make money for yourself, and make money for your shareholders. You can accomplish that goal in two ways, sell more things and reduce your expenses. You're probably already selling as much as you can, so the easiest way to have the lowest possible expenses is to pay your employees as little as you can get away with. Most of the rest of the economy is run by other Bezoses who have more or less the same goals - workers are, as a result, forced to work for less than the value of their labour because there's a lack of better options.  Theres a snowball effect that takes place here - the bigger Amazon gets, the more money and influence you have and the more you're able to accept risks and expand your company - big companies have an easier time getting even bigger than smaller ones. You're also more able to influence government policy by lobbying or threatening to move jobs abroad if, say, minimum wage or tax rates were to increase. As more and more of the economy is absorbed by these massive corporations smaller businesses where individuals or small groups of employees have bargaining power fall by the wayside. A single worker at your company has no ability to demand a better wage since they can easily be fired and replaced by an even more desperate person who needs the wage to live.  To put it as simply as possible, those middle class jobs have begun to disappear because it's more profitable to pay your employees less. The less of those jobs there are the more people are forced to work lower paying jobs out of desperation, and as more people work in these jobs at or below the poverty line they become less able to have any influence on this system as they have no time to politically organize when they're working two jobs and no bargaining power when they're easily replaceable.

Lower gears mean that the engine is turning more times (more power) for every time the wheel turns. This gives it the extra oomph to accelerate. But the engine can only rev so high, so more gears are needed to go faster. As you go faster the gear ratio changes meaning the engine is turning less times for every rev of the wheel. This creates efficiency at high cruising speeds for better gas mileage. It only takes about 15 horsepower to keep a car going at speed, while it takes many more ponies to get up to that speed. All that being said, there is a style of transmission known as a continuously variable transmission, which doesn't change gears so much as smoothly changes the ratio as needed while driving, resulting in a smooth acceleration without changing individual gears.",

    "question": "eli5: What is the intrinsic value of crypto, what will protect it from banks tanking it in their backing, and how is it more than just a literal gamble?",
    "answer": "The value in crypto is because other people value it, and use it as a means of exchange. That's basically it.  Every currency is underpinned by the market it has exclusivity in. For example, people often say the US dollar is not backed in anything, but that's not strictly true. It's backed by the US economy, and the fact that in order to play in the US economy you must use dollars, and you must pay your taxes in dollars. Due to the sheer size of the US economy, the dollar is so powerful that it's used as the de-facto means of exchange worldwide, hence why 90-95% of *all* international trade uses dollars, either directly or indirectly as an intermediate currency (most of that remaining 5-10% are Euros for inter-EU trade, and then Yen which is largely in lockstep with the US Dollar).  For crypto, that market is (at the moment) mainly illicit items that can't really be purchased in real-world currencies because the governments that issue those currencies are the ones who define those items as being illicit in the first place.  However, that's also fundamentally what will likely by the undoing of crypto, at least as we know it. Currently, crypto has a very short list of primary uses ranging the full spectrum of illicit activities, from relatively harmless activities like buying marijuana or pirated music to extremely harmful activities like buying child pornography. But the really two big problems crypto has are due to it's association with money laundering and avoiding economic sanctions, and as a result there's a reason why something on the order of 90% of crypto mining is done in China, Russia, Iran, and Venezuela.  Further, should the United States choose to do so, it can pretty easily swat crypto down, as the US government can effectively ban any party from exchanging dollars for crypto, either directly or indirectly, as is shown by sanctions against existing governments. The only reason crypto hasn't been hit *yet* is essentially because it's beneath the notice of Congress and the White House, but it'll only take a single high-profile case facilitated by crypto exchange for the US government to go to town on crypto markets, at which point the value will tank because crypto's already poor liquidity will be effectively frozen. For an example; just think of what happens if/when there is a major terrorist attack in a western country paid for in Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever. The US government *already* locked down on air travel in the wake of 9/11, despite complaints that persist to this day. Just think of what the US government will do when the only people who suffer are seen in the popular zeitgeist as terrorists, kiddy-diddlers, and drug dealers.  In essence; crypto is neither an investment or a store of value. It is a flash in the pan, and a means of short term speculation, but while the technology is neat (and will probably be used legitimately in the future), the current coins are all at the mercy of powerful governmental agencies, and will only survive (and maintain value) so long as they fly under the radar.",

From the FAQ for the study I am in:  >**How can this test tell the difference between antibodies produced from infection and antibodies produced from vaccination?**   When a person is infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, their body makes antibodies in response to several viral proteins, including nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein. The vaccines currently approved for use in the UK only trigger antibodies against spike (S) protein.   The lateral flow devices (LFDs) that we used in the self-test antibody study detected antibodies to the spike protein so we were unable to tell if the antibodies were due to infection or to the vaccine (which is why you have been asked to provide this blood sample).

Calling them protons would induce new problems like too the mistake of the direction electricity moves, I think the problem is worse. So quite reasonable they are called holes, not protons."

    "question": "ELI5:What is animal instinct ?",
    "answer": "Instincts are complex innate behaviours, reflexes are simple innate behaviours. For instance, when a human baby is dipped underwater, it immediately holds its breath. That's a reflex.  When a sea turtle hatches from its egg, it heads straight for the ocean. That's far more complex than just holding your breath so we consider it instinctual behaviour.  The behaviour of complex living organisms is largely governed by brain chemistry and hormones in particular. When you find yourself in a surprising situation, it's a hormonal response that causes you to feel afraid, aggressive, overjoyed or any other emotion. And your behaviour will result from that.   I'm sure you've heard of the fight or flight response in the face of something scary for instance. Something surprises the organism and the brain immediately gives a response that causes the organism to respond with aggression or fear.  So now that we understand that brain chemistry can determine how an organism behaves. We're also closer to understanding how instinctual behaviour is \"stored\" or passed on from parent to sibling.  Take those hatching sea turtles for instance. Sea turtles immediately head for the ocean by heading towards the brightest patch of the horizon in their field of vision. If they keep doing that, they'll find the quickest route to the water.  There are many possible reactions a baby turtle could take after hatching:  * It could lie still and rest after the exertion of hatching * It could start looking for food to replenish its energy after hatching * It could set off in a random direction * It could follow the scent of water (and risk ending up in the wrong body of water rather than the ocean)  But lots of animals are hanging around for the express purpose of feasting on the hatching baby turtles.  So natural selection means that the lazy turtles, the lost turtles, the wandering turtles are the first to die. And the turtles whose brain chemistry urges them to get moving, to head towards the light on the horizon and to get into the water are the ones that survive the most.  The turtles who survive the most pass on their genes the most. Evolution simply means that for baby turtles, those whose brain chemistry urges them to rush for the ocean fastest are the best young survivors. And over time that means that every single turtle that hatches has the overwhelming desire to race to the water.  That's instinct. And that's how instinct is stored and passed on. They are chemical balances in the brain that produce behaviour that is so beneficial to survival that pretty much every member of a species has it. Because all others die.",

But looking back at the history of that area of Europe in the years between 1815 and 1945, the only war on mainland Europe that could've involved Switzerland was World War 1. Switzerland had not formed any defensive alliances or the like simply because they didn't need to.   Ultimately, the geography of the region kept it safe.   The effort to invade Switzerland would have weakened the attacker too much for little gain. Additionally, the lack of any coast meant no navy, and no colonies to fight over. Thus no reason to get involved in WW1. Same for WW2.  So they kept this pretence of neutrality to deflect any embarrassing questions about their actions during WW2 (cough cough stolen Nazi gold cough), stuck to their guns on it during the cold war, and now everyone thinks Switzerland is a peace loving nation in the middle of a violent continent and always has been.

    "answer": "Your TV provider literally points a satellite dish at the appropriate satellite or has a direct digital feed from the transmission suite. When I say direct, they pay internet backbone companies to provide a high speed, multi routed feed between the sites.  As an aside ...  I've been in the transmission suite at the Atlanta studio of CNN international although it was many years ago.  The signal from the studio was piped over to the dish farm next to the Turner \"Mansion\" and transmitted to various satellites from there.  For my work we were using the Intelsat uplink and the corresponding downlink in the UK at Madley. At the downlink it used to then be bounced up to the Astra satellite constellation for Europe.  So while a great deal will have changed since then, the studio signal will still follow a similar path as it did then. The delay from the studio to a TV in Europe was about a second.  The London studio feed was sent to Atlanta in a similar way, but was piped to an uplink in London using a high speed, dedicated connection. These days your home broadband is many times faster than what was used, but even 4k signals aren't that bandwidth hungry really.  The London feed would be mixed in at the studio in Atlanta, so the delay could be a couple of seconds if you were watching a TV in London while standing in the London studio. It was an odd experience.  All the feeds are backed up with alternate systems in case of failure. Although the London studio feed was cut off once when a backhoe dug through both primary and alternate fibres on the route to the uplink.

Or if you\u2019re not in STEM and don\u2019t know where to start, go to a STEM student or prof and help them find you classes where you\u2019ll learn about those things: resonant frequency, signals, energy-based physics (such as calculating the height a roller coaster will go based on potential energy instead of based on velocity and acceleration), thermodynamics, waves.    And if you\u2019re \u201cbad at math\u201d, change your self-conception and push yourself to get better. Math is about practice more than it is about talent. And math is necessary to really, truly appreciate the beauty of these ways of thinking. So make friends with math.    If you\u2019re not at a university, use Khan academy or any university\u2019s free online courses to study this stuff.     The key point is to study it rigorously - this means homework and math, not just reading a popular science book about the mysteries of the universe.    Just like a musician needs to play his scales, someone who wants to experience the beauty that Tesla is referring to needs to do his math homework.",

A migraine is a neurological condition that can come with fat more complex symptoms. these will often include a headache as an obvious one, but not always, and will often include other effects too.

Other people also experience things like a sensitivity to light or noise, and undoubtedly other things I am not aware of.  Some people have obvious triggers like certain foods or stresses, others are more of a mystery.  If I get a migraine, that is me often shut down for a day or more - the auras starting give me only a few minutes to stop doing things like driving before it becomes dangerous, and then I can be left dealing with the headache and vomiting for a significant period and unable to do anything else other than hiding in bed and trying to sleep through as much as possible.

    "answer": "Any system have angular momentum, around a pivot of choice. Spin is just angular momentum of a particle when considered alone.  Angular momentum are *not* the L=r x v from classical Newtonian mechanics. Instead, we define angular momentum by their main defining characteristic: it is preserved under all continuous rotations. The classical Newtonian angular momentum is a formula that give you a preserved quantity, assuming Newtonian physics is correct. But once we move into the weirder realm of quantum mechanics, we have to abandon the formula and stick with the most important property, the fact that it's preserved under continuous rotations.  Given an arbitrary axis (this axis is normally named z), we can talk about angular momentum around this axis. This is a measurable number that is preserved under all continuous rotations around that axis. Due to funky issue with quantum physics, you can't actually talk about angular momentum around all axis at the same time, because trying to measure this number around one axis disrupt the rest; in fact it's not even possible to talk angular momentum about 2 axes at the same time. However, you can talk about magnitude squared of total angular momentum (when you consider rotation around ALL axis), which IS a number that can be measured.  Without loss of generality, we can assume that we do have a special z-axis where angular momentum exist, because this allows us to have an additional number to identify an electron: the secondary spin number.  If you consider one single particle by itself, this angular momentum give you the spin number, and the angular momentum around one specific z-axis give you the secondary spin number. For an electron, the spin number is fixed to be 1/2, so really you only care about secondary spin number. If you assume that there exist angular momentum around the z-axis, this 1/2 spin number - which tell you angular momentum - limit the possible value of angular momentum around the z-axis. By choosing 1 direction to be called \"up\" (associated with positive number) and the other direction \"down\", we have 2 values +1/2 and -1/2. But warning: this \"up\" and \"down\" don't have any actual geometric meaning, they are merely analogy from classical Newtonian mechanics where angular momentum is represented by a vector that can actually point up or down.  When you consider an atom together with an electron, the whole system itself have a different number that are also angular momentum (of the system). This is called total angular momentum. The electron, when considered alone, have its own angular momentum which is called spin. Subtracting the spin number from the total angular momentum give you orbital angular momentum. Since electron all have the same spin number, you only need orbital angular momentum and secondary spin number if you want to distinguish electrons by angular momentum.",

The \"dimension\" of something refers to how many pieces of information you need to locate something within a space. You need those four values to precisely identify where and when something is, and so spacetime is (classically, at least) four-dimensional.  The reason time slows down at high speeds is more complicated than it appears on the surface: light *always* travels at the speed of light. The thing is, I really do mean **always** -- no matter how fast you're moving, you will always measure light to be moving away from you at one single speed.  >\"But, what if you're moving forward at one-quarter the speed of light and turn on a flashlight? If you're moving at quarter lightspeed, and turn on a flashlight which travels *at* lightspeed, wouldn't you measure the beam of light to be traveling at the remaining 75%?\"  No, you actually wouldn't. That's the thing: a clock that you carry on you will measure \"correct\" time, but a distant clock will appear to slow down, and it will slow down exactly as much as it needs to so that you measure your flashlight's beam to be traveling exactly at lightspeed.  If you don't think you understand it, that's fine; the *theory of relativity* is very hard to grasp, especially if this is the first you're hearing about it.",

    "answer": "Beekeeper checking in - queens are produced from the same egg as workers.  The egg selected to be a future queen is fed more royal jelly which changes her physiology when she is developing.  Once born, she will battle any other queens to the death.  She then matures for about a week, then flies off for mating.  She typically mates with 15-25 drones.  After returning to the hive she will start laying eggs within a week or so.  At here peak she will lay approx 1,500 eggs per day.    Workers are all female, but do not typically lay eggs.  They have different types of roles in the hive based on age. In rare instances they will lay eggs, but since they never mated, the eggs are all male.  Drones are males with no father, but a grandfather.  They do no work to improve the hive.  Their only function is to spread the genetics of the hive.  They are driven put of the hive in the late fall since they have no value at that point.  Honey is nectar that is collected, concentrated and processed with enzymes.  A forager bee brings the honey into the hive and passes it to another worker.  They then store it into a comb.  During this time enzymes in the bee start processing the honey.  Once stored the comb is left open until the concentration of water drops to around 17% and then it is capped.  Workers live about 6 weeks, unless it is winter and they can live up to 4 months in the hive.  Queens live 2-4 years assuming they are not killed by another queen.",

    "answer": "For some weird reason, if you apply electricity to certain crystals, they vibrate with fairly consistent frequencies.   We can make devices that count the number of times the crystal has vibrated. So if the crystal is one that vibrates roughly 16,000 times per second, we can connect that counter to a device that counts up to 16,000 then sends a signal. Every signal represents 1 second passing. Now that we have a device that can count seconds (or fractions of a second), we can make a clock! (This is how digital watches work!)  So basically DSLRs and computers have tiny digital watches inside without a screen.   This isn't always super accurate. Cheaper crystals and mechanisms aren't exactly perfect. If I leave my Nintendo Switch disconnected from the internet, it's usually 2-3 minutes off of the \"correct\" time within 24 hours.

Back in the day, the Display Adapter simply sent out to the screen whatever was in the display memory area of the computer. It was put there by the CPU.

AC is easier to transport across large distance, as it basically loses less strength (Voltage) over longer cabling. Even great conductors like copper have some resistance, so that particularity of AC is important.

A lot of the challenging prep work like the gardening, cutting, and cooking are done for you, making it easy.

    "question": "ELI5: Why is the ground wire called \"ground\" when it goes back to the source and not into the ground?",
    "answer": "That's not entirely correct. The ground wire is not an alternative neutral wire for safety. It does not go back into the main grid. (even though it is usually connected with the neutral) It goes into the ground connector to form a solid connection with the earth.   The diffirence between the neutral and the ground is that the neutral goes back to the source where the electricity is created. Thus, the powerplants generator. Whereas the ground literally goes to a big rod inserted into the Earth.   The point of the Ground wire, besides to prevent against electrocution if metal objects get energised because of a fault, like you correctly said, is actually to act as a common refference and equalising point for all electrical systems and measurements.  Ground is basically the closest thing we have as a \"zero\" for electrical potential, so it's very useful for measuring with. It's also important for our safety that our electrical systems are equalised with ground, because it's the closest to the electrical potential that us humans are at, because we're always standing on it.   It also helps prevent against interferance or issues when you connect two circuits with their own powersource together. Because electrical potential is a very local thing. So two independent isolated battery powered circuits that are both reading 24 volts across their poles, might actually have two entirely diffirent amounts of electrical potential when compared to eachother. So by connecting them both to ground you create a sort of soft electrical connection between the two circuits that equalises them to one another so they'll play nice together, without the chance of interferance or damage.",

    "answer": "So, there actually are literal [dopamine pumps](https://www.duopa.com/how-duopa-works) that are used for Parkinson's disease. Epinephrine (also called adrenaline) is a very important neurotransmitter, and that's also what's in EpiPens. But this doesn't always work for a few reasons.  First, a lot of those chemicals can't easily get from our blood into our brain tissue (or vice versa) since there's a protective barrier. Even the dopamine pump above uses a modified version of dopamine that can, but we can't always do that well.  Second, when you dump a bunch of hormones or chemicals on the body the body reacts by making less of that hormone itself to try to keep itself in balance. This can sometimes cause serious side effects.  Third, very very few problems in the brain are due to a simple issue of \"not enough of a single chemical\" (even Parkinson's, which is basically caused by the brain not being able to make dopamine anymore, is more complicated) You don't water plants in your house with a fire hose because the water that's really good for the plants isn't so great for your computer on the desk next to them.

    "answer": ">So I roughly get how DVDs and CDs work, from my understanding it's a laser that burns little grooves on to the disc and then reads them.  Nope. An optical disc drive shines a laser at the disc, and how the laser reflects in each microscopic location is used to encode the data. At a disc manufacturing plant, a master is used to stamp or etch physical pits into a disc. But recordable discs use a dye or metal alloy that a higher-energy laser can heat to change the reflectivity.  HDDs use a magnetic platter to record the data. An actuator arm moves to different locations on the spinning disc, and the magnetic polarity of each microscopic sector determines the data.  SSDs store electric charge in NAND flash cells. Effectively it's like a tiny capacitor that traps the charge there. The charge state determines the data.

    "answer": "As a truck driver, scales usually aren't more than a small inconvinence as long as you planned ahead and checked your axle weights before hitting the road. Being caught overweight can be incredibly expensive and also can put you out of service until you or your company can remedy the situation.   With DOT scales I am mostly concerned about axle weights. Your load may be under maximum payload for the truck but overweight on one or more axles. Interstate scales typically measure each axle group individually. In general weights max 12,000 lbs for the front axle 34,000 lbs for the rear truck axles a 34,000 lbs for the trailer axles (on most trucks). It can get much more complicated with oversize/overweight heavy hauling and other specialized trucks and trailer.   Most trailers have the ability to slide the trailer axles forward and back and trucks usually can slide the 5th wheel to help you distribute the weight properly over all the axles.     I do scale with most loads before hitting the road at the nearest truck stop if the shipper doesn't have one on location. Most truck stops have scales for $10-12 and you can re-weigh for about $2 if you need to adjust the load or truck. Fuel weight must also be taken into consideration. I have also scaled my truck empty as well to get a baseline weight so I have an idea of what my payload weight can be before arriving at the shipper.",

    "answer": "While it's hard to prove one way or the other, there have been sites discovered where interbreeding was found in the remains. Socially, that implies that a hybrid neanderthal-human individual was not only possible, but that such individuals were accepted parts of their community and lived until adulthood (implying they weren't too weak or sickly to survive). Depending on ancestry there's also a very high likelihood that a given individual will carry the markers of minor neanderthal  additions to their genes. It's much lower in sub-Saharan groups, much higher in Eurasian, because neanderthals really didn't backtrack from Eurasia into Africa once they evolved.  There's also a high margin of human-caused extinction through out-competing them. Tools known to be made by neanderthals as opposed to modern human ancestors don't show many significant changes over an astoundingly long time- We were figuring out how to make better tools, they weren't. With better tools, we had better living. Eventually, it's suggested, there just became more and more of us, less and less of them, until we were all that was left.   More like neighborhood gentrification, and less of an explicit war where two groups met on a battlefield and murdered each other to death.     There's also an argument to be made for climate change as a cause. It's a theory that's getting stronger and stronger in regards to Pleistocene megafauna (with the exception of australia); that it wasn't just anthropocentric, and as the ice age ended, biomes changed. Eventually they changed to a point of not being able to support the megafauna.... Or the neanderthals.     There are a lot of factors at play, and we really aren't at a place where we can point to any one of them and say \"That.

    "answer": "A naked short is an illegal practice in which an institution borrows a share of a stock and shorts it, except the share has not been determined to exist.   For example, say there are 1 million shares of a company. A normal short would be borrowing 100 shares and paying a premium to open a contract giving you the right to sell those shares at a price (the strike price) regardless of what the price is. This means if the stock goes down you can sell it for more than its worth. A naked short, is borrowing shares that aren\u2019t determined to exist. This means if there are 1 million shares, and someone\u2019s buys short contracts worth more shares than what exist in the market, it\u2019s artificial.   This is illegal because it creates an artificial market with non existent shares and mostly undermines the whole system. However this is a common practice by many financial institutions such as hedge funds (citadel for example).   As for what happened on CNBC, an anchor woman actually called what the current hedge funds and market participants naked shorting, in reference to AMC and GameStop stock. This is significant because naked shorting is illegal. So a trusted financial news source like CNBC on air saying it\u2019s naked shorting is validating the reason why many people are buying and holding shares of company\u2019s like AMC and GameStop.

If you need to turn really sharply you keep turning/pulling the lever and the brakes are applied to the left track so its now at a dead stop and only the right track is being powered this lets the tank make very sharp turns.

In rare instances they will lay eggs, but since they never mated, the eggs are all male.  Drones are males with no father, but a grandfather.  They do no work to improve the hive.  Their only function is to spread the genetics of the hive.  They are driven put of the hive in the late fall since they have no value at that point.  Honey is nectar that is collected, concentrated and processed with enzymes.  A forager bee brings the honey into the hive and passes it to another worker.  They then store it into a comb.  During this time enzymes in the bee start processing the honey.  Once stored the comb is left open until the concentration of water drops to around 17% and then it is capped.  Workers live about 6 weeks, unless it is winter and they can live up to 4 months in the hive.  Queens live 2-4 years assuming they are not killed by another queen.",

    "answer": "In an INCREDIBLY simple way, imagine \"borrowing\" a stock off someone to sell (at the current price now), and then buying the same stock later on to return it back to the original person.   You HOPE that the price lowers so you can pocket the difference. Example: If you borrow a stock from me, and sell for \u00a310, you want the price to lower. That way when the time comes to return it back to me, you buy it for the lower price of \u00a35, give it back to me, and you pocket the extra \u00a35.  To quickly go into what happened with GME, the hedgefunds borrowed ALL THE STOCKS that exists, AND THEN MORE STOCKS on top of that, thinking that the price of GME was gonna drop. In fairness, the Price had been in freefall for years and GameStop has been on its last legs for a long time. Smart people on Reddit noticed this, and brought all the stocks, which pushed the prices up. To translate this into the example: they borrowed and sold for $10 a share (not the correct price), but the price went up to about $300 per share. This put the hedgefunds in deficit by $290 per share (about $6Billion total). They had also borrowed more stocks than actually existed. If the price had gone, its not a big deal because you pay off the extra and pocket a bit less. But the price went up.

    "answer": "Hoo boy. That is a simple question with a very complex answer. To understand why you need to understand torque and angular momentum in spinning bodies.  So the basics you need to know is we measure the force of something spinning by its angular momentum. This force is a tangent to the circle or a straight line only intersecting the spin at one point. You can visualize this by spinning something on the end of a string then letting it go. That object on a string will fly off in one direction. That direction is the direction of the force being applied at that moment. Which indicates to you the direction of it's angular momentum.  Now we go to torque. To make something spin it needs to be fixed to a singular point. There must be an axis which it spins around and resists that straight line force we call angular momentum. Otherwise the spin would just turn to linear force. As we know from physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. So as the axis pulls against the object, so to must the object pull against the axis. That pull on the axis is what we call a torque. The direction of that torque force is defined with a right hand rule. If you point your right hand and curl your fingers in the direction of the spin and stick your thumb out, the direction of your thumb is the direction of the torque force. Notice your thumb is now pointing perpendicular to the spin.   (A YouTube video to explain it in depth https://youtu.be/mRZGdvJQnPU)  Now we tie that back into your car. So all 4 wheels on your car are spinning. As we just established that means they have angular momentum and torque. Fortunately for you the torque is normally not enough to overcome the friction between your tires and the road. So you never feel that torque. However, when you hit a deep enough puddle, all that friction is removed and the perpendicular torque force of your car easily can pull you sideways.",

    "question": "ELI5: What is the actual purpose of AC power?",
    "answer": "Electric generators and motors can use dc or ac, not both.  DC generators and motors need brushes to catch the power from the spinning part, and this brushes require big big maintenance. When AC was discovered, it allowed to make generators and motors at 2/3 of the price of a DC one, and they are completely maintenance free, because they don\u2019t need a brush system. So they won, and were adopted in mass.  Not having brushes allows to produce higher voltages without issues. Higher voltage allows to  transfer the same power using thinner wires, this makes transport and the generator parts to be done with thin cheaper wires, saving even more money.  Then the power transport in cables has losses along the line, electrons flow heats the cables, with high voltage, you can transport power by moving fewer electrons but with higher force in each of them. So again, another win for high voltage systems, and again high voltage production is easier if done in AC. There are DC high voltage lines, for example, submarine cables and nation to nation lines may be high voltage DC; not so common but it\u2019s done sometime, for example, a country with 115v 50hz AC may transform it to DC to sell it to another country that then transforms it into its own 220V 60hz AC. This is done because the 2 different AC systems are completely incompatible, because both need to transform it, they may have a DC line between them.  Add in that illumination can be done with DC or AC without difference.   Basically the only drawback for AC is computers. Computers need low voltage DC. So we use an AC line for everything, and transform it to low voltage DC only in the devices that need it. Another thing that can\u2019t work in AC are batteries, so any system that has a battery needs to be DC. This doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t do a AC system with a DC conversion between system and battery, sometime it\u2019s done, it\u2019s overly expensive but may be done.",

That distance, in 3D, forms an imaginary shell around the source, the sun, and all points perfectly equidistant the centre; a sphere. By analogy, in 2D, a ring. If we compare rings of different sizes, but with the same centre, we can ask how we get from one ring to the other. I mean, how do we get the smaller ring to grow to be the larger one? The \"most evenly fair\" way is if the ring grew evenly, I mean all parts expanding uniformly. Now take a \"thin pizza slice\" worth of an entire ring, like 5 degree's worth. For the smaller ring to grow to the bigger ring that same section \"stretches\" and if stretching evenly it makes sense to think that we could draw as many lines straight from one to the other. Those lines are straight and perfectly radial, that is, they go straight back to the centre if we imagine. So? Those individual lines don't have any \"angle\" to them. Each is straight from the centre. That's what we perceive. This applies because light is a wave phenomenon, and waves, like ripples a pound have this property.",

A common lead free solder is SAC 305 which is 97% tin, 3% silver, and 0.5% copper, the mix of metals helps give it the right properties  The ideal mixture comes down to how everything interacts to form little metallic crystals  When you solder something its not like glue where there's material A, layer of glue, material B, there's actually an interface layer.  If you're soldering a copper wire to a gold pad there will be gold, layer of gold/tin/other solder bits that transition from pure gold to pure solder, then layer of solder, then tin/copper/solder mix as it bonds to the wire, then just the copper wire.

The ultraviolet light damages the cells that make up your living skin, and causes them to turn red or blister or peel.  Sunscreen is like a wall that doesn't let quite as much of that invisible, damaging light through. Apply it and it dries into a sort of invisible armor that our eyes can't see... but that ultraviolet light (which our eyes also can't see) can't get through. So our skin doesn't get as damaged, and we don't get \"burned\".",

    "answer": "If you're only interested in *air quality...* Sure, humans could potentially survive in 5,000ppm CO2, but there would be pretty profound physiological and cognitive impacts to that long-term.  Around 1,000ppm is where harms to health begin, and exposure to 30,000 and above is generally only allowed for short intervals.  In EL5: Carbon dioxide builds up in blood as a byproduct of your body and cells working.  This \"waste\" from your cells actually turns your blood acidic and the gas needs to be removed before it begins to damage fragile organs, which is done in your lungs every time your breathe. Your lungs *really* like to exchange CO2 between your blood and the air, which is usually a good thing when you have a lot of carbon dioxide in your blood and little in the air. However, as the air you inhale becomes more saturated with CO2, your lungs will actually work \"backwards\" to move carbon dioxide from the *air into your blood.* This likely comes down to the fact that human lungs have evolved to expect atmospheric CO2 at <500ppm concentrations, so its never been an evolutionary advantage to figure out how to do that.   Plants, by contrast, use atmospheric carbon as a sort of \"fuel\" during photosynthesis - not producing it as waste - so have no such issue with a buildup of concentration.",

Eels have a specialised organ that momentarily produces a difference in eletric potential (Voltage) along a series of cells in the eels body. This series of cells only produce a small voltage, but when summed together, they create quite a large difference and quite a bit of charge. This momentary voltage source finds its path of least resistance through various outlets on the eels body and shocks the would be predator.   To correct a few details from other comments, there will always a be a \"destination\" for charge to flow to. Current is the amount of charge flowing through a specific point at any given time, and resistance is a scalar. The amount of current flowing through a circuit is proportional to the voltage.

That's the part of the addiction that nicotine gum and patches can deal with.  The other part is habitual. The smoker gets used to taking regular breaks and other physical cues like having the cigarette in their hand.   Some people have to attack both in order to break the addiction. I knew a smoker who tried and failed to quit 3 or 4 times using gum and patches. He finally figured out he was still craving holding something in his fingers.

    "answer": "The other answers talking about your pupils are incorrect, or at least not fully correct. It's true that the pupil changes size to let different amounts of light it, but that just takes a few seconds.   The process of eyes adjusting to the dark has to do with a chemical in the cells of your retina. Your retina (the part of your eye that senses light and sends the signals to your brain) is made up of two types of cells, rods and cones. Cones see in color but don't work if there's not enough light. Rods only see light and dark, but they can sense very small amounts of light.   In the rod cells there's a chemical called rhodopsin that's responsible for absorbing light and turning that into a signal to send to your brain, When a molecule of rhodopsin absorbs light, it breaks apart. When it's very bright out, all of the rhodopsin molecules are being broken apart by all the light. If you suddenly move into the dark, you don't have any rhodopsin left, so the rod cells can't absorb the light. It takes about 30 minutes for the rhodopsin molecules to \"regenerate\" so that the rod cells can absorb fully light again.",

    "answer": "*I may have got a bit carried away here, but I didn't have anything else to do this evening... well, nothing important.*  Electricity is about how things with charge push and pull each other around.  Magnetism is... a weird twisty thing that makes some metals stick to each other sometimes.  Electricity was known about over 4,000 years ago - or rather, they knew about effects of electricity; that certain fish could shock you, that lightning was a weird phenomena, that if you rubbed amber you could get things to stick to it. But without the scientific method or the tools to investigate it it was mostly just a curiosity.  There is evidence of people knowing about magnetism over 2,000 years ago; noticing that there were special rocks that iron would stick to.  Around 600 BCE the Greek philosopher and mathematician Thales of Miletus studied both static electric and magnetic effects, and thought they seemed similar - both involving stuff sticking to other things, but with the magnetic stone always working, and the amber material (used for static electricity) needing to be rubbed to make it stick.  By the 12th century travellers in China and later Europe started using magnetic materials to navigate by - the first magnetic compasses. And with that, studying magnetism became a bit more important. In 1600 an English scientist, William Gilbert published a book called De Magnete, in which he set out a bunch of experiments he'd done on magnetism and electricity, showing that they were separate things (and that Thales was wrong), that the Earth was a giant magnet, and he introduced the term electricus (from the Greek for \"like amber\") to describe what we now call electricity (a term that was first used nearly 50 years later).  The 17th and 19th centuries saw a big increase in research on this new \"electricity\" thing, with people like Benjamin Franklin carrying out all sorts of experiments to try to understand it, in 1800 Alessandro Volta developed a battery that could store electricity; electricity was all the rage - although not necessarily with that many practical uses.  In 1819 a Danish physicist, Hans Christian \u00d8rsted, noticed that if you moved a wire with current flowing in it near a compass, the compass needle twitched.  This was the breakthrough needed to finally start putting the pieces together on how electricity and magnetism worked. Over the next few years people like \u00d8rsted, Amp\u00e8re, Faraday, Ohm and Gauss made great progress in understanding how electricity and magnetism worked and were related, and in the 1860s James Clerk Maxwell put it all together to create a series of laws that showed Electricity and Magnetism to be different aspects of the same thing. Not electricity and magnetism, but electromagnetism. Magnetism could be seen as what happens when you view electric effects from a different perspective. Changing electric effects create magnetic effects, and changing magnetic effects produce electric effects.  But there were a couple of weird things that came out of Maxwell's Equations.  If you solved his equations in a vacuum (where there was no existing electric or magnetic effects), you got waves. Waves travelling at a very specific speed defined by existing electric and magnetic physical constants. This speed - when calculated - turned out to be the same as the speed of light. This was another major breakthrough; understanding that light was ripples in electric and magnetic fields - that it was created by wiggling things with charge. Wiggle the thing with charge and you get a changing electric effect. Now you have a changing electric effect you have a changing magnetic effect. But that changing magnetic effect creates a new changing electric effect and so on and so on... the interchanging electric and magnetic effects keep each other going, moving across space as a combined ripple. Light.  Except not just light. Light is only the part we can see. This stuff helped people understand that a bunch of other things they knew about - ultraviolet light, infra-red radiation, later radio waves, microwaves, x-rays... they were all the same thing, these electromagnetic waves, just with different frequencies of wiggle.  Of course there were still problems with the theories, and it would take people like Einstein to put together more pieces of the puzzle - uncovering Special Relativity and what we now call Quantum Mechanics. By the mid-20th century quantum mechanics was developed enough to fill in the last few bits.  ... so... erm... yes.  **tl;dr**: Electromagnetism is a physical interaction - a way stuff affects other stuff. It used to be electricity and magnetism, but it turns out electric and magnetic effects are just different ways of viewing the same thing.",

    "answer": "Not an expert but my best guess is mostly cost, and safety.   If a Lipo takes an impact that can puncture it, there's a chemical fire that's spews poisonous gas. If a lead acid gets a puncture, there's a leak that can cause chemical burns if mishandled.  Lead acid batteries last a few years in a vehicle. Given the cost of repairs in other parts of the vehicle, the lifespan of some vehicles, and the low cost of occasionally topping up the battery until it needs complete replacing, having a lead acid vs lipo isn't that big a deal.   Others have already mentioned how lipos struggle at low temps, but high temps are a big issue too. The battery needs to output a kilowatt for a few seconds, to crank the engine, which for a lead acid warms it slightly but no big deal, but for a Lipo, that would bring it to a really high temp. Lipos at high temp are more prone to exploding. So starting an older engine that needs cranking longer than few seconds is rolling the dice.  All this given in mind, lead acids are the best of a bad bunch. The only other work around is using a Lipo as a battery bank, and a super capacitor bank to crank the engine, which solves the high output when cranking. Then adding heating and cooling elements to the battery case to solve the low and high temps during use. Then specially designing a lipo and it's case to make sure during a crash it doesn't explode.  At that point though you've massively increased the cost to install the lipo effectively, making it's use as a battery crank overkill, or go with it and make a hybrid or electric car. Might as well just use a generic lead acid and forget about it.",

You can only have one heart because of the way your body is laid out.  Your heart is kinda in the middle-ish of your body, and all of your blood *has* to go to your heart, make a detour through your lungs to pick up oxygen, and then swish around your body to drop the oxygen off.   If you had two hearts, this carefully-choreographed system just wouldn\u2019t work.  But kidneys.   Kidneys are special.  They\u2019re unusual.   They kinda just float in your abdomen, at the back.

    "answer": "Forgive me if any of this is off, I took the applicable courses for this like 20 years ago, so probably don't remember everything. But in essence:   Metabolism is the process by which your body converts what you eat and drink into energy. Calories are combined with oxygen to release the energy your body needs to function. You burn calories even while at rest, in order to supply the energy your body needs. The number of calories your body uses to carry out these basic functions is known as your basal metabolic rate. In addition to your basal metabolic rate, two other factors determine how many calories your body burns each day (Food processing (thermogenesis) and Physical activity). A portion of calories not burned through these processes is converted into glycogens (sugar essentially), which are easily accessed and metabolised first. The rest are stored by your body in the form of fat, which is retained to supply energy when there aren't enough other nutrients available.  The weight of calorie dense foods does not translate into the amount of weight gained. That weight is determined by the amount of extra calories stored by your body. To translate this into numbers, each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories. The human body needs to burn about 4100 calories to burn that lbs of fat, which will only happen if there are no other easily accessible calories (like glycogens) available.  So, if you consume something calorie dense that exceeds the number of calories your body needs to function, the rest will be stored as fat. Do this often enough, and you'll gain weight.",

My first response was, sure I can design this for you, but why is this a problem that you think needs to be solved?  This was his explanation:  His wife, and and many of her friends, who are getting up in their age, have to pee in the middle of the night. So they go to the bathroom and sit down. Being half sleepy, and don't wanting to wake their husbands by turning on the light, they just go and sit down. And feel the cold porcelain rim of the toilet.  Women have to sit down to pee. Men don't. We men approach the toilet FACING towards it, so we see if the seat is up or down. So we see if the seat is up or down, and if it is down, we raise it and do our business.

    "answer": "Until someone comes with more energy to get into detail, real brief & pre-k:  Sugar (glucose is the simplest form, and the most rapidly absorbed)* hitting your bloodstream causes insulin release, a hormone made by your pancreas.  Insulin acts as the key to help glucose get into cells (they need it for energy, extra is stored for later).  If a lot of glucose hits your blood suddenly, a lot of insulin has to be released too.  But if insulin keeps pestering the cells too much, they eventually get insensitive to it, and they need more insulin to open the same amount of doors.  So whereas, before, say you needed 10 insulin for 10 glucose (made up #s) now you need 100 insulin for 10 glucose and so on, it worsens.  Your pancreas too keeps having to put out more insulin, eventually it tires out.  So at some point your cells just aren\u2019t responding to the amount of insulin you produce, there\u2019s not enough insulin to remove all that glucose from your blood, and you\u2019ve got high blood glucose (which damages organs/tissues).  You\u2019ll need drugs either to help your pancreas release/produce more insulin, or straight up need insulin injections.  *Simple sugars are bad bc they\u2019re already glucose/almost glucose.  So 50g of skittles hit your blood as glucose faster than 50g of a more complex carb which will take longer to get broken down to glucose and will thus give your pancreas more time to trickle out insulin, and your cells more time to welcome a trickle of insulin rather than a sudden onslaught, making them less likely to get intolerant.  You\u2019ll also have less glucose floating freely in your blood, causing mischief.  *Edit:* Also yeah, as someone else correctly mentioned, it\u2019s excess body fat that more directly causes diabetes to develop; you can be long-term overweight and get diabetes without having eaten a single simple sugar food in your life (although glucose still gets formed by the breakdown of your meals).  My reply\u2019s really just focused on sugar re: diabetes.  Further mistakes/omissions in my insulin resistance mechanism explanation, but eh, come PhD this if you have the energy.  Simplifying anything complex risks omission and misrepresentation.",

    "answer": "A neat thing about the electromagnetic spectrum is that moving electricity can generate magnetism and and a moving magnetic field can generate electrical activity. If you did high school physics then that covers how all of that works.   TMS uses a wand that generates a magnetic field that moves or flips, which generates electrical activity within your brain. The amount that it can generate is actually really small but its able to effect how the neurons in your brain work at least temporarily. This is because neurons communicate using a combination of electrical and chemical signalling. We don't understand fully how it works - because we don't really understand how depression fully works, but its fairly safe and has temporary and beneficial effects for depression.",

There's not really one singular definition for \"processed\" that everyone can agree on, so it can be really hard to say that it does or doesn't have a direct health impact.   That said, three of the things that a lot of processed foods have in common is that they are easy to get, easy to prep, and easy to eat a lot of. They stay stable on store and warehouse shelves for longer, so they tend to be cheaper and in stock more often. A lot of the challenging prep work like the gardening, cutting, and cooking are done for you, making it easy. They also tend to have a lot of the extra food removed during the manufacturing process, so they are more calorie dense per bite.   Sugar is the big deal in my opinion. We consume so much more sugar these days than we used too. Candy, soda, sugar filled \"low fat\" options, \"health foods\" like granola that are packed with sugar, etc...

It refers to the thought process of \"I already spent some money on this. It would be a shame if I stopped spending money on it now.\" In other words, throwing \"good money after bad money.\"  You could imagine the fallacy as \"I bought a boat for $100, but then it sunk in the river. Because I don't want my $100 to be wasted, I'm going to rent a truck for $50 to pull it out. If that truck sinks into the mud, then I'll buy a different truck for $75 so that my $150 isn't wasted.\" The pattern then repeats.  In your specific conversation, the fact that you bought the investment means it is indeed a \"sunk cost\"; the fact that you aren't getting the same money back means it is sunk. If you spend more money on the investment just because you have the investment and are hoping it pays off, you are probably doing a \"sunk cost fallacy\". As a term it is entirely different from profit.

    "answer": "Food intolerance (like lactose) is not an allergy. Most adult humans lose ability to produce an enzyme needed to digest lactose as they mature; some populations are more likely to keep it than others. Because you can\u2019t properly digest lactose, it ends up as sugar in your lower intestine, where certain bacteria use it as abundant food, growing more than they would normally and upsetting the balance with the rest of the flora that eventually results in gas/cramping/diarrhoea etc as your intestines try to get rid of the irritant.   Allergies are a consequence of your immune system encountering substances (often proteins, though not exclusively), that it identifies as harmful. It\u2019s a normal part of the immune system\u2019s function to detect and react to foreign substances - that\u2019s how it fights off infections by bacteria, viruses and parasites. But sometimes, it overreacts to things it shouldn\u2019t, like food, drugs, pollen etc - these are not harmful on their own, but the immune system responds as if they are and the mechanisms that would stop it from overreacting might be slow or weak. So you get allergic reactions. Obviously, not everyone is allergic to the same thing - I can eat as many peanuts as I want, but if I touch some insecticides, I get hives and eventually end up suffocating; you might react the same to strawberries.

    "answer": "Oh! Finally. My time to shine!  So. For reference, I\u2019m currently researching and developing solutions for the Metadata Crisis in the music industry.   The issue is piracy. Let me explain.   Platform exclusivity was tried in the beginning of the DSP (direct service providers) coming to prominence. If you remember, Jay-Z took his catalogue off Spotify and hosted it exclusively on Tidal. Drake had his albums exclusive to Apple Music for a timeframe. This was the norm because artists were being cut massive cheques. The result of all this was we saw these albums get disproportionately pirated by users of platforms that the albums weren\u2019t exclusive too. So the execs at the big 3 decided platform exclusives were over.   We still don\u2019t have a concrete reason why platform exclusivity leads to higher rates of piracy in music when the same isn\u2019t true of podcasting or video. The prevailing theory is that it has to do with the devaluation of music.",

    "question": "ELI5: Fibonacci Sequence: what is it?",
    "answer": "Basically it's a number pattern where each sequential number is the sum of the prior two:  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 etc.  Or  0 + 1 = 1;  1 + 1 = 2;  1 + 2 = 3;  Etc.  Taken alone, it seems arbitrary and boring, but the ratio of each number pair gets closer and closer to a very special number in nature called phi (pronounced fee), which is also known as the golden or divine ratio.  Just as the greek letter pi represents the (approximate) value of 3.14 and is a special number relating to the circumference of circles, phi, which represents a value around 1.6,  has an odd way of showing up in all sorts of natural phenomena. We see this ratio in spirals, such as the spiral of a hurricane, the spiral of the milky way galaxy, or even snail shells. We see it in the proportions of our own anatomy: the ratio of the successive digits of your fingers, or of your hand to your forearm is approximately 1.6 etc. There are many more examples if you do a Google image search for the golden ratio.  Then universality of this relationship lead philosophers to regard it as almost like gods calling card, an artifact of the divine source code that created the natural world (hence the divine ratio). A more secular argument would say something similar but drop god from the equation and say it has something to do with fundamental forces that govern the physical world.   Regardless of the explanation, it seems generally accepted that this ratio is related not just to physical phenomenon but also to our perception of physical beauty. As such it is often utilized in art, especially after the the renaissance, with lots old old famous paintings incorporating the golden ratio. even contemporary marketing firms attempt to utilize it in brand logos, believing it a sort of shortcut to creating an aesthetically pleasing image (the new pepsi logo is an example of this approach in marketing)  Hope that helps!",

[It's actually 4 different chambers](https://breathefreely.com/pasha-chamber-of-sinuses/) (2 for each nostril) for the majority of the population (there's an estimated 10% of the population that have 6 sinus chambers/3 per nostril).  So the short and simple of it is that any of the 4 chambers could be inflamed at any given time causing the 'stuffy nose' symptom in one or both nostrils. But, your body is pretty good about making sure you keep breathing (unless you have sleep apnea) so it regulates the erectile tissue in each side of your sinus to usually make sure you can breath out of one of them.   To get a little deeper into it, the process of warming and humidifying the air you're breathing into your lungs through your nose is energy and resource intensive so your body only sends the extra blood to one nostril at a time. But this extra blood causes the tissue to swell (kind of like when you injure your skin and the area around it swells because of the increased blood flow to the injury) and when you're sick you already have increased blood flow to the infection in your sinuses and this increases the stuffiness on the side your body is trying to regulate the air quality in.

Suppose I am a fruit seller, and I sell apples, oranges and pears, but not peaches.  Late in the afternoon, I have sold all of my apples, but still have a few oranges and pears left.  A guy comes up to me and asks me what I sell.  I tell him I have oranges and pears.  The guy tells me he wants to buy apples and peaches.  I explain to him that although I have neither apples nor peaches right now, I do sell apples, and if he comes back tomorrow I will have some apples for sale, but I never sell peaches.  I decide rather than having to explain this to every customer I will have a sign that tells people what I have available to buy, so the next day I have a blackboard in front of my stall and write apples: 15, oranges: 23, pears: 17.  As the day goes on, and I sell my fruit, I change the numbers so that as I sell the fruit, people passing by know what I have left to buy.  At some point I sell my last apple.  I want to be able to indicate that although I don't have any apples right now, I do sell them, and if they come back tomorrow I will have some more, but I want to make that distinct from the fact that I do not sell peaches.  If I can write apples: 0, oranges: 5, pears: 3, it says something different from saying oranges: 5, pears: 3, because it indicates that although I have no apples right now, I still do sell apples.  That might be a somewhat trivial example, but the ability to indicate that I have zero of something as distinct from not having it allows for a useful distinction to be made.

If you have 3 satellites overhead in space and they all were broadcasting a time synchronized signal, you could triangulate your position very accurately. Like within a few meters. Very handy for flying planes and dropping bombs very accurately.   So they launched a bunch of satellites up there and everything was great. At the time only the military could access / decode the signals. Then, a Korean airliner (which did NOT have GPS obviously) flew into Russian airspace and the Russians shot it down (they weren't very friendly back then and it didn't help that the Korean pilots couldn't communicate very well) thinking it was an American spy plane which they were expecting at the time.

    "answer": "There would be no way to route traffic efficiently without IP addressing.  The only way it's done efficiently is by knowing based on network address where to route your traffic.  Think of it more like sending something in the mail, vs a phone book.  You need multiple pieces of information to get it to the right place right?  You need Zip Code (US), State, City, Street Address, and Person.  You mail that piece of mail from one side of the US to another, the first thing they do is look at that information to determine how it's going to get to it's destination.  You can't just put a name on there, as there is no way for the mail service to know that name out of the 300 million people living in the US.  So they start with ZIP code (which is really smaller than state), then narrow it down by street address, then eventually when it gets into your mailbox your wife hands you the mail because it ends up with your name on it.  Same way IPs work.  The numbers are not just randomly assigned.  Network address space is reserved by classes.  And routing tables know where those addresses are assigned to.  We know that everything 8.x.x.x is going somewhere, and everything that 9.x.x.x is going somewhere.  Then, as it gets closer to the destination, we use the additional digits to pinpoint where it's going until we get to the last digit and then we have the server.  Also, its VERY important to know, that name does not equal 1 server or IP address.  For example, when you go to [google.com](https://google.com) you go to 10000s of servers, not just a single server with a single IP address.  Also, for smaller setups, 1 server can house multiple IP addresses.  I have 5 domain names hosted on a single IP address.  That's why you can't just go to a name.  Really the name gets resolved to an address (or one in a pool of addresses), and then when you hit that server your browser says \"Hey, I'm trying to get to [myfavoritedomain.com](https://myfavoritedomain.com)\" and the web server serves it up.",

You basically find someone who disagree with you on the probable outcome of some event so much that they are ready to put some money on the line.  At some point, they are so certain of themselves that they will agree to give you more money if they are wrong than you will give them of they are right. Y'all write a contract stipulating that.  As the event gets closer, if you change your mind, you can try to find someone else to buy the bet from you. If you made a truly bad bet, you might end up selling the contract for a negative value. Example: you bet 100$ at 3:1, you will pay 100$ if you lose, but get 300$ if you win. As time goes by, it seems doubtful to you that you will win. You can offer to sell the bet for -50$, meaning you give 50$ in addition to the bet. For you, you end up eating only a 50$ loss instead of 100$, so that's a better position. For the person buying the bet, they essentially end up with a 50$ at 7:1 bet. Since they will pay 100$ if they lose, minutes the 50$ you gave them (50$ total), and they will get 300$ if they win, plus the 50$ you gave them (350$ total).

    "answer": "When Tesla said \u201cthink of\u201d he meant rigorously. Tesla thought in ways that created functioning machines - ie rigorous and realistic ways.    I would recommend taking courses on the resonant frequency of structures, on signal theory, on physics where energy calculations are used, things like potential energy and energy flux.    If you\u2019re in college, find these courses in the syllabus. Or if you\u2019re not in STEM and don\u2019t know where to start, go to a STEM student or prof and help them find you classes where you\u2019ll learn about those things: resonant frequency, signals, energy-based physics (such as calculating the height a roller coaster will go based on potential energy instead of based on velocity and acceleration), thermodynamics, waves.    And if you\u2019re \u201cbad at math\u201d, change your self-conception and push yourself to get better. Math is about practice more than it is about talent. And math is necessary to really, truly appreciate the beauty of these ways of thinking. So make friends with math.    If you\u2019re not at a university, use Khan academy or any university\u2019s free online courses to study this stuff.     The key point is to study it rigorously - this means homework and math, not just reading a popular science book about the mysteries of the universe.

    "question": "ELI5 If time is a dimension, why can you only go in one direction?",
    "answer": "Ok, so this is far from a fully accepted theory, but it *is* a theory, and based off some very well-accepted theories.   In General Relativity, you don\u2019t really \u201cmove\u201d through time. Instead, you *are* at all points in time.   As an example with lower dimensions so we can understand it intuitively, imagine a pen moving left and right. Then, as time progresses, you move the page downward under the pen, leaving a line on that page.   The left/right position of that line on the paper represents the spacial position of the pen, while the up/down position represents the temporal position of the pen.   If you look at a single horizontal slice of that line, and you move the horizontal slice upwards at a steady rate, you will see what *looks* like a point moving left and right, imitating the path that your pen took.   But you know that the horizontal slice giving the motion of the pen is actually only a slice of the full picture. In fact, the ink of the pen makes a full line. It just *exists* in both time and space. It\u2019s not moving, it\u2019s not going forward or backward, it\u2019s just a line sitting there.   The only way to see motion from this line is by only looking at a single moving slice - a single moment in time - at any given instant.   This is what happens in real life. You are a 4-dimensional, static line through spacetime. The reason you seem to move, think, and be dynamic in any way is because you\u2019re experiencing a single slice of time, a single instant in your \u201cworldline\u201d (that\u2019s the real name for it), and that slice of time you experience is moving forward through time at 1 second per second.   Ok, but here\u2019s where it gets really weird.   How do you know that you\u2019re progressing through time? You\u2019re only ever living in the exact present, it\u2019s not like you have a sense that tells you time is passing, so how do you know it is?  Generally, the response is that you remember all the past instants in time, right? That layer of recent memories tells you you\u2019re moving through time, forming new memories.   But (assuming we accept that memories are due to some arrangement of matter in your brain, and not caused by magic or spirits or whatever), there\u2019s absolutely no way for you to differentiate between actually progressing through time and developing new memories, or just being a static entity that can\u2019t move, or do anything, that\u2019s stuck in a single instant in time, but with memories from all the previous instants.   Essentially, the idea is you aren\u2019t moving through time, you\u2019re stuck in this exact moment, but with the *memories* in your brain telling you that you are moving through time.   So now, the question isn\u2019t \u201cwhy are we only moving in one direction through time\u201d because in fact, you aren\u2019t moving through time at all. You\u2019re just a single static slice of your 4-dimensional worldline with the memories making you *think* you\u2019re moving through time. Rather, the question is \u201cwhy do we only remember the past, and not the future\u201d.   And the general idea for that is because of entropy. Let\u2019s pretend that your brain is a watermelon, and you\u2019re trying to remember a hammer that\u2019s coming to smash that watermelon.   Now, theoretically, it\u2019s within the laws of physics for a smashed watermelon to spontaneously bounce off the ground, join together, and throw a hammer into the air. It\u2019s *possible*, but insanely unlikely, because every one of billions of trillions of particles would have to vibrate in exactly the right way at the right time to accomplish that.   On the other hand, it\u2019s *very* likely for a watermelon hit by a hammer to spontaneously smash. That\u2019s something that increases entropy, and you have common sense to realize that would happen.   So, if we see a smashed watermelon, we can pretty easily conclude, \u201chey, a hammer probably hit this\u201d. If we see an *unsmashed* watermelon though, you can\u2019t conclude \u201cthis watermelon probably solidified from many small chunks of watermelon on the ground and threw a hammer into the air\u201d.   In a way, you can say a smashed watermelon \u201cremembers\u201d into the past that it was hit by a hammer.   On the other hand, a solid watermelon can\u2019t \u201cremember\u201d into the future that it *will be* smashed, because the probability that a solid, unsmashed watermelon corresponds to being hit by a hammer in the future is so vanishingly small.   Your brain is basically that watermelon. It can\u2019t remember into the future because it\u2019s so insanely unlikely that a brain affected by the future would somehow reverse every process required to, for example, erase a memory, send the signal back down the optic nerve, causing your cones to yeet out photons into space.   **TL;DR:** *You don\u2019t move through time at all, you\u2019re stuck in time with memory of the past. You only remember the past and not the future because entropy*",

    "question": "ELI5: Why home blood tests do not exist, while we can measure our sugar levels with personal devices at home?",
    "answer": "The answer is: we're still trying to get there!  Sugar is easy to find for a few reasons.  1. Sugar is a small molecule who's shape is pretty consistent. This lets us design very effective receptors to interact with it in all environments (temp pH and salt content) The above isn't true for say proteins who's configurations are dependent on their local environment. Thus anything that interacts with them must do so under very controlled conditions. This might require either very specific environmental controls, or tedious preprocessing (preparation steps before measurement)  2. Sugar is relatively abundant to other species in your blood. Sugar exists on the order of magnitude of mmol/L in your blood. This is hundreds to hundreds of thousands of times higher than other relevant biomarkers. This is the difference of trying to measure the weight of a sandwich and the weight of the salt in the meat of the sandwich. The problems simply are not comparable. We also need more blood to be confident we will find something. 3. Diabetes is a massive market that provides financial incentive that has hugely oversaturated the sugar diagnostics market. If you're making a portable sensor, chances are that in the early stages, you're going to need a well known test case to compare your results to. Sugar measurement is a simple initial test. It's low hanging fruit for the reasons listed above. There are tons of comparison points. It's financially viable. Even if your goal is to diagnose cancer, at some point you will likely end up diagnosing sugar concentration.  There's no reason we can't make portable diagnostic devices that can measure protein and DNA concentrations, but it is simply harder to do than it is to measure sugar concentrations. We will get there one day.  tl;dr  Diagnostics is hard. Sugar is diagnostics on easy mode",

Is that how heat energy works? Would it stay in the body unless there was sweat to evaporate? Sounds like the information sources I found are leaving out some important detail about how heat energy works cause this explanation does not compute. Anyone care to fill in the missing info?     Releasing the sweat does not have any cooling effect whatsoever. It needs to evaporate. The vast majority of body heat is lost in the form of evaporation energy. A liquid requires a certain threshold energy - enthalpy - to change into its gaseous form. That's where the body heat disappears. While your body also loses heat by other means (heat radiation and simple heat transfer to surrounding materials), evaporation energy lost to sweat evaporation is usually orders of magnitude bigger.",

    "answer": "X-ray scans are purely to show density - less dense (and water rich) tissues are relatively transparent, whereas mineral and metal rich areas are more dense, hence have a higher ability to attenuate (block over a short distance) X-rays. That\u2019s how the imaging works to detect abnormalities in the body.  You\u2019d need chemical testing to figure out what the filling is made from. Amalgams are mercury based alloys, but the thing about heavy metal toxicity is that they need to be in a water soluble form (such as nitrate or chloride salts, through reaction with their acids) to actually be able to get into the body where they cause neurological issues. As a metal, mercury poses little threat when confined as a solid alloy, as it isn\u2019t susceptible to chemical reactions in the oral environment. Mercury when usually handled isn\u2019t even dangerous through the skin, but it can be as it gives off vapours which are toxic when inhaled, so prolonged exposure of course isn\u2019t recommended.  When used in dentistry amalgams, the mercury is generally combined with silver, copper, or tin.  Also, amalgams are generally a grey-silvery metal, so that\u2019s how you can easily tell as a rule of thumb.

They will have a lower resting heart rate, and improved energy levels over someone who is more sedentary. They are at greater risk for joint injury, but proper supplements and weight exercise can mitigate these effects. As far as pulmonary health in concerned, if they\u2019re not actively smoking or contributing to worsening their lung health, it should improve health in this regard, even going so far as to reverse some of the harmful effects of past smoking.

If you\u2019re looking for advice on training to be faster, plyometric workouts and integrating more interval-based training into your schedule are where you would want to look. Otherwise, it can just be something where you go out for a few miles a day and enjoy the leisure of moving freely.  Lastly, the key to any cardio exercise is core strength.

    "question": "ELI5: Why is the ground wire called \"ground\" when it goes back to the source and not into the ground?",
    "answer": "That's not entirely correct. The ground wire is not an alternative neutral wire for safety. It does not go back into the main grid. (even though it is usually connected with the neutral) It goes into the ground connector to form a solid connection with the earth.   The diffirence between the neutral and the ground is that the neutral goes back to the source where the electricity is created. Thus, the powerplants generator. Whereas the ground literally goes to a big rod inserted into the Earth.   The point of the Ground wire, besides to prevent against electrocution if metal objects get energised because of a fault, like you correctly said, is actually to act as a common refference and equalising point for all electrical systems and measurements.  Ground is basically the closest thing we have as a \"zero\" for electrical potential, so it's very useful for measuring with. It's also important for our safety that our electrical systems are equalised with ground, because it's the closest to the electrical potential that us humans are at, because we're always standing on it.   It also helps prevent against interferance or issues when you connect two circuits with their own powersource together. Because electrical potential is a very local thing. So two independent isolated battery powered circuits that are both reading 24 volts across their poles, might actually have two entirely diffirent amounts of electrical potential when compared to eachother. So by connecting them both to ground you create a sort of soft electrical connection between the two circuits that equalises them to one another so they'll play nice together, without the chance of interferance or damage.",

The amount that it can generate is actually really small but its able to effect how the neurons in your brain work at least temporarily.

    "answer": "\"Meat\" isn't just muscle flesh from an animal.  There is a very rapid aging process that occurs in meat shortly after an animal dies.  Depending on the animal's health and stress level at the time it died, you end up with with one of three outcomes:  1) PSE meat, which is light colored and spongy  2) Normal meat, which is the stuff you find in your supermarket  3) DFD meat, which is dark, tough, and has the \"gamey\" taste people associate with non-traditional animals.  The taste itself is the result of the meat being less acidic than normal meat.  Animals killed on a large, commercial farm will be in good health and are killed instantly, so that the animal doesn't experience any stress while dying.  This results in mostly normal meat being produced from their carcasses.  There will be some PSE and DFD meat but it either gets turned into pet food or thrown out.  When people go out and hunt meat they're killing animals that are typically in poor health and/or which are under a lot of stress (if for no other reason than that getting shot and slowly bleeding to death is stressful).  This almost always produces DFD meat.  Because people associate game animals with the gamey taste of DFD meat, some ranches that grow those animals commercially will deliberately produce DFD meat to maintain the gamey taste that people expect.    But if you were to kill a game animal in the same manner as a domestic animal (IE, killing it instantaneously when at peak physical condition) then it would taste pretty similar to the meat from domestic animals.",

Most estate agents will list on there from a small terrace house to a multi million \u00a3 mansion. A hobby for a surprising number of people (most will admit to doing the same if you mention you do it too) is to look around at really expensive properties, normally when you've bought a lottery ticket and start imagining what might happen if you win.  You can search huge areas, so I'd always look for somewhere with loads of land. Not that bothered about the house, but I always wanted to put on my own festival. I now do run festivals for a living (and I'm still poor) so realised a lottery win wasn't needed, but I digress.  I once found a place in somewhere like Oxfordshire, enormous amount of land, and oddly cheap. Looking at the photos is became weirder - several houses almost laid out like a street, in the middle of this old farmland. Anyone who's familiar with the UK would instantly recognise them as military style housing, just something about the style that gives them away. The usual smattering of farm buildings too, but they were fenced off. Not like quaint English farm fencing, full on Jurassic Park Category A Supermax prison style electric fencing.  Interest piqued, I read more into it - you were forbidden, by law with ongoing inspections by the Department of Health after purchase and continuing indefinitely, to farm and livestock or crops on the land. Ever.  More reading gave the answer - in the 1990s the UK had an outbreak of BSE or \"Mad Cow Disease\" itself a prion disease. There was footage in the news in the late 90s of cattle infected, filmed on a camcorder, footage from several years earlier that had since been declassified - cows struggling to stand, odd gait, basically \"mad\" and in the full throes of BSE. The footage was filmed at this farm - it was a UK government research centre set up to study the crisis, and was no longer needed. The infected animals were killed, incinerated, and the ashes dumped on the land. But it still isn't safe to use for any food production.  Like I say, the crisis was over by then, hence it being decommissioned, but reading further was 10 times worse than the worst horror film ever.  At one point the UK government thought BSE would turn into CJD in humans. Indeed, for a few hundred to date it has, but it has something like a 20 year incubation period, is totally incurable, and one of the worst diseases known to man. But the original fear was that anyone who'd eaten beef in the previous few decades, as in, fucking _everyone_ (vegetarianism being relatively rare in those days and beef being a stable) would develop CJD at some point in the next decade or two. Nevermind Covid, we're talking 28 Days Later type stuff.  Fortunately, for reasons I don't fully understand, but the comments have explained, it didn't happen.",

It's like shards of glass, you can break them and break them, but no matter how much you keep breaking them, they can still cut.   Prions are bits and pieces of mis folded proteins, and they can get tangled up in our healthy proteins and cause them to become mis folded as well. It's hard to break something that is already broken, which is how we normally sterilize and sanitize.   Prion risk can be managed by preventing contamination in same species situations. For instance if you aren't a cannibal, and you don't grow food in fertilizer made from human waste, then the chances of you getting prions in your system is low.   There are some cross species prion diseases but they are rarer than same species infections. This is why it's a bad idea to feed animals feed made with that same animal (not to mention cruel).

    "answer": "First of all, \u201cmedically induced coma\u201d isn\u2019t a medical term. What it actually refers to is a combination of pain medicine and sedation medicine that are used to keep people calm and comfortable while they have a breathing tube in.   Second, this \u201ccoma\u201d or state of sedation isn\u2019t done to treat the overdose itself. It is done again to allow for uncomfortable medical interventions such as a breathing tube and possibly cooling (targeted temperature management).  When he overdosed, his breathing became so slow and shallow and he did not get enough oxygen and he could not blow out carbon dioxide. When the heart doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen it will stop beating. When the brain doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen for long enough, it causes brain damage (anoxic brain injury).   CPR is used to circulate blood as we try to restart the heart with medication and/or shocks.  A breathing tube is placed to breath for the patient until they can breath on their own.  When a patient has cardiac/respiratory arrest, they almost always have some amount of brain damage, unless high quality CPR was started immediately. We keep them on ventilators (breathing machine connected to the breathing tube that goes down his throat) because the brain damage means he likely wont be able to breath on his own for a while. In many cases after cardiac arrest we also \u201ccool\u201d the patient. This means bringing down their body temperature low enough that it slows metabolism by brain cells and can possibly reduce long term brain damage.  In the next couple days, they will try turning down the sedation to see if he wakes up and evaluate how his brain is functioning (called a sedation vacation). If he does wake up, they will also try a spontaneous breathing trial- turning the ventilator off briefly to see if he is able to breath on his own. If he passes both of those they may be able to take the breathing tube out, and if not they will keep it and try again the next day.",

    "answer": "If I'm not mistaken, you're asking why in an enclosed are like a room, walls aren't always continuous but have columns sticking out. Is that it?  The answer is that, except in special cases, walls do not support anything (but their own weight), but columns do. This is why when you see a building being constructed, you see the frame (beams and columns) being built first, and then walls built later. This is why you sometimes see beams sticking out from the sides of the roof. In this case, we say that walls (called curtain walls) are not an active structural element: they do not contribute to the supporting frame. They're there like curtains: because nobody likes to live in a room with no walls (but they're also helpful in avoiding certain complex loads).  Slabs that make the floor are typically supported by the horizontal beams on the side (and sometimes columns when they're huge). Beams are supported by columns around the corners, and they're sometimes hidden. Columns are supported by the frame from the lower level, and so on..all the way to the foundations.  There are cases when architectural considerations make it difficult to use columns and beams only, so \"supporting walls\" are sometimes added.",

Well you generally don't want your objects passing through each other so you want the game to detect when two objects have \"collided\" so you can have them do things like explode or bounce off of each other. So you write some code for this \"collision detection.\"  Well, just about every game in the world has objects for which we need to detect collisions. So rather than every game studio in the world independently coming up with their own collision detection code from scratch, I'm just going to sell them mine. Saves them time and makes me money.  But just doing collusion detection wouldn't be efficient. So we add in just about all the stuff that's common to all games, or all games of a certain genre. Like applying gravity to objects, code for rending objects into the images you see on the screen, determining line of sight, etc. etc.  Take all of those common and ubiquitous functions that are applicable to lots of different games and package it up and now you have a game engine.  Now, buying a prepackaged game engine isn't *necessary* in the sense that you can still build a game without one, but in the end you'd just have to code all that stuff yourself anyway (basically building your own \"game engine\" piece by piece). Now if you want to build a game and not go insane doing it, and also maybe do it within your life time and to make a profit, then yes, using established game engines is pretty much a necessity.  There are many different game engines for two main reasons:  1. Some game engines are tailored for specific kind of genres. A game engine tailored for racing games will include different kinds of code than a game engine tailored for side scrollers or one tailored for first-person shooters. 2.

Secretory - your body secretes electrolytes into the lumen (open space in intestines).  2.

If you have 3 satellites overhead in space and they all were broadcasting a time synchronized signal, you could triangulate your position very accurately. Like within a few meters. Very handy for flying planes and dropping bombs very accurately.   So they launched a bunch of satellites up there and everything was great. At the time only the military could access / decode the signals. Then, a Korean airliner (which did NOT have GPS obviously) flew into Russian airspace and the Russians shot it down (they weren't very friendly back then and it didn't help that the Korean pilots couldn't communicate very well) thinking it was an American spy plane which they were expecting at the time. Anyways, lots of people died.   Realizing that that really sucked, and GPS totally could have prevented that from happening, President Reagan decided that everyone should have access to GPS signals.

Your heart is kinda in the middle-ish of your body, and all of your blood *has* to go to your heart, make a detour through your lungs to pick up oxygen, and then swish around your body to drop the oxygen off.   If you had two hearts, this carefully-choreographed system just wouldn\u2019t work.  But kidneys.   Kidneys are special.  They\u2019re unusual.   They kinda just float in your abdomen, at the back.

Her handwriting is nicer than mine and my letters look squiggly and ugly compared to hers. Same letters, they just look different. You can make letters on a screen look different, too. That's called a \"font\". Just like different handwriting... same letters that just look a little different. A QR code is really just a weird font. It's handwriting that looks so funny that only a specialist can read it. (Your scanner is the specialist.)  Did you ever notice that QR codes always have three corners that look like plain boxes? That's how the computer knows which side is the top. If you look at a book that's upside down, you know to turn it over before you try to read it. Those boxes tell the computer which way to turn it before it tries to read it.  There's also something called \"error correction\" built in. If I put a dot here for the letter \"c\", then I also put a dot over there to represent that same \"c\". I don't need both dots; I can use either one. But that way, if part of my QR code gets scratched off or dirty, I have a better chance of reading the right message because the clean parts still have enough information.  And finally, there's something called a \"checksum\". A checksum is a small fact about what you just read. For example, I might say \"cat(3)\". That 3 at the end would mean that you should have read a 3-letter word. Or maybe I say \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.(23,12)\" and that means you should have read 23 consonants and 12 vowels. If what you read doesn't match the checksum, then you should try reading it again. A barcode scanner can actually read a barcode multiple times if it has to to get it right.  Quick note: There are many different types of barcodes: UPC, QR, Aztec, Code9. There's a different one on your mail. There's a different one on the sticker on the fruit you buy at the grocery store.

    "answer": "A system with 3 numbers would be 0 1 2 10 11 12 etc but that isn't particularly important. The answer is that our mathematics doesn't really include 10 unique numbers, just 10 unique symbols. The entirety of humankind ***doesn't*** agree on this system, there are plenty of cultures and languages that used different number bases and even modern European languages still have traces of this although the symbols are standardized. Some languages don't even have a positional numbering system for example roman numerals I II III IV V etc.  &#x200B;  Base 10 is fairly arbitrary, some argue it happened because we have 10 fingers but there are other bases with other benefits. Computer operations are all done in binary (0 1 10 11) at a base level, a lot of higher level computer science works using hexadecimal numbers (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F).",

When you\u2019re singing, you are trying to hit a specific note. You know you\u2019re on because you hear the note being played, then you harmonize with that note that you\u2019re hearing with your voice. Your ear can be trained to hear harmony and what is called \u201cintervals\u201d (the distance between 2 notes). Practicing pitch matching with your voice and practicing interval matching will train you to both hear what a harmony is supposed to sound like and feel what you need to do in your stomach/throat to match that sound.

    "answer": "Believe it or not, we do it by looking at what color they are.  Stars emit light that's a mixture of many different colors.  Chemical elements, on the other hand, tend to absorb particular colors.  So we wait for a distant planet to pass between us and star, and then we look at what colors from that star's light got absorbed by the planet; that tells us what elements are in its atmosphere.  (Think of a planet's atmosphere as being sort of like a stained-glass window.  Even though we've only got a single pixel of light, if we know what colors *could* be in the window, we can figure out how many panes of each color it must have in order to produce the pixel that we're seeing.)

    "answer": "The effect is very, very minor, but it *does* happen!  You're probably familiar with the name *Albert Einstein* from his famous equation E=mc^2.  If you're particularly geeky, \"Hey, Einstein, I'm on your side!\"  Something else he's known for is the theory of *relativity* (two of them, actually) which say that a lot of things are *relative to* other things -- that is, they can't be objectively measured. Specifically, we're interested in the components of both theories that talk about time.  The theory of *special relativity* says that a moving clock ticks slower than a stationary clock. That is, a clock that's moving very fast will measure time slower ***relative to*** a clock that's not moving. It won't see its own seconds passing any slower, but it will see a stationary clock's seconds passing *faster.*  The other theory, about *general* relativity, says that a clock deeper in a gravity well ticks slower than one farther away. Conversely, a clock further away ticks faster.  Put these two together, and someone living on a space station actually experiences the flow of time very slightly differently: after spending six months aboard the ISS, Einstein's theories predict that an astronaut would age about 0.005 seconds *less* than us schlubs on Earth.",

When elements that are radioactive decay, or if nuclear fusion occurs, or as previously stated, a high energy neutron collides with an atom (cosmic rays, etc), you can maintain the same number of protons (same element) bit a different number of neutrons (isotope).    Protons and Neutrons are also made of Quarks. Quarks have spin. Protons have two positive spins (up) and one negative spin (down), Neutrons have two Negative and one positive. The Quarks of the hadrons (protons and neutrons) will form spin couples (an up with a down). Sometimes an up turns into a down, or vice-versa.  Coupling stabilizes them. If a quark has no couple, and it flips, then it may find a partner and stabilize.",

    "question": "ELI5: Given the many layers of checks and balances in the court system, how can 1-5% of innocent people end up in prison for crimes they didn\u2019t commit?",
    "answer": "Human error has a lot to do with this, really. Even after taking out all the biases people have in general, such as accusing someone based off their physical appearance, and a lot of circumstantial evidence making a case, you'd still get those wrongful convictions (probably a lot less, but you'd still get them.)  There are two major causes of these.  The first one is the fact that human memory is complete and utter garbage, and can be modified by repetition of alternate facts. This has been proven time and time again, where a police officer repeatedly smashing you with facts about a crime you didn't commit, may lead you to believe you actually did.  This further extends to dubious and faulty memory of events. Many wrongful convictions depend on witnesses misidentifying the culprit, as their brain sees the accused, and if they look close enough to the actual culprit, they will identify them as if they were, because minute differences do not register unless you put the two side by side. Likewise, other details may be super vague, and mis-remembered or misquoted. Often, all you remember is \"the man robbed a bank, and he looked a bit like this\", because your brain needs to remember this for survival reasons, but the rest of the details won't even be remotely in there. This explains the reason why if you are in a similar situation to a crime, you will be also suddenly a bit more anxious, as if the crime was about to happen again. Survival instinct is a fickle thing that hurts all this stuff.  And then, we get to the second major cause: Plea deals. This one is probably the biggest culprit, and it basically goes like this.  You get arrested for (let's say) drug trafficking charges. You know you didn't do it, but somehow, they found a pound of cocaine in your car. While you're struggling with the confusion of \"how the hell did that get there\", and \"who the hell do you know might have left it there for you to be screwed over\", an officer comes in for interrogation, and tries to coax a confession out of you. They say they found the cocaine, they say that through a few contacts, they have witnesses to say you're guilty, and to boot, they found your fingerprints on the cocaine's bag.  After a few hours of back and forth and forth and back of you telling them you wouldn't even know where to get cocaine, and them saying that they have all this evidence, the confession is only a formality at this point, but they still want it, because \"confessing goes a long way in reducing your sentence\", since it means you admit and know that what you did was wrong... Well, they drop in the bomb: If you admit that it is your cocaine, they can drop the charge from drug trafficking, to drug possession, whose sentence is much lighter, so that's sort of meeting halfway. Tired, annoyed, and honestly just wanting to be done with this, you accept the deal, write and sign a confession, and they send you either to the station's cell, or home (often with bail), awaiting the formality that is the trial.  At this point, they have everything they need: They have heavily circumstantial evidence, that is corroborated by you confessing. Suddenly, you get a year in jail for a crime you don't even know how to commit, because honestly, it's better than the alternative of being in jail for drug trafficking... And that's how you got wrongfully convicted.  That kind of scenario happens a lot more often than you probably think, with more and more police officers being caught planting evidence they \"find\" in a car they are ssearching (often illegally) thanks to their body cams. This can also land the same way with murder, but the steps that have to be taken are very different, since there isn't really a step down they usually get you to in order to get there.  Those are the main two culprits of wrongful convictions.",

But as technology advances, we are able to store more and more bits of information on smaller devices freeing up resources and power, and we decomission and recycle the older and bulkier things.  Think back to floppy disks. Not that big, but you would need about 3 or 4 thousand floppy disks worth of information to install a windows 10 operating system to a current computer, because each floppy disk was capable of only several kilobytes or megabytes of info. Now we can do it in minutes with a terabyte sized thumb drive.

That's debt the government has to borrow. Invade another country? More debt. Cut taxes for the wealthy but maintain spending? More debt.  Government debt isn't necessarily bad. i.e. sometimes even in a balanced budget, there are cash flow issues. Government has to pay employees year round, but only gets paid during tax season.

Its when a government has so much debt it can't make its _interest_ payments - that's what happened to Greece in the banking crisis bunch of years back.

    "answer": "We dont fully understand the way cells store and retrieve memories, but I can give an overview based off what we do know. Keep in mind the brain is incredibly complex and we have multiple structures interacting here.. Certain brain cells (groups of neurons and synapses) can be chained together to react to a specific stimuli delivered from the brain. Because of this, one system of the brain can \"tell\" a group of cells to react a specific way in the future. In the case of memory, the brain structure responsible for memory formation tells a group of brain cells to react a specific way to another stiumuli: the one triggered by the memory retrieval system.   So one system has the ability to tell brain cells how to form memories, and another knows how to send out an impulse to relieve that memory, and interpret it. But this in turn triggers a bunch of other systems: the ones responsible for how we perceive the world. Our brain is really good at simulating a world we can navigate based on stimuli. We really don't interact with the world, but a simulation our brain comes up with. So that same ability can be applied to generate something without any external stimuli, such as the memory retrieval system.  So the full loop ends up being outside stimuli are taken in, the world perception is formed, the memory formation system stores it in some brain cells, the memory retrieval system triggers a retrieval, and the world perception system can be leveraged to take that stimuli and make yourself perceive the sound of Arnold Schwarzenegger quotes or whatever.

    "question": "ELI5: what do Galois groups actually prove about solvability?",
    "answer": "It is a bit complicated but let me try. First, there's two notions called \"solvability,\" one for polynomials and one for groups (I'll explain what groups are later). They'll turn out to be very intimately related, although it may not look like it from the get go. First let me explain the polynomial side of things, it might be a bit easier to grasp.  Ok, so start with a field (we usually take Q, so if you're not sure what the general definition of a field is, just picture rational numbers). You can ask yourself \"what's the smallest set containing Q and some real number that isn't in Q which has a coherent addition and multiplication such that all the \"nice\" properties hold (distributivity, commutativity, associativity, additive and multiplicative inverses)? For example, what's the smallest \"nice\" set (field) containing Q and sqrt(2)? Well, it turns out the best you can do is take all of Q and add all rational multiples of sqrt(2), so you end up with a set consisting of all rational numbers, all rational multiples of sqrt(2), and all possible sums of those. So, \u00bd is an element. So is 3/4xsqrt(2), and so is 4/435435+ 32/9sqrt(2). More generally, any element can be written as a+bsqrt(2), for a and b rational numbers. That set is written Q\\[sqrt(2)\\] (Q adjoin root 2).   Now, I may want to solve a polynomial like x\\^2 -2. The roots as you know are sqrt 2 and - sqrt 2, so they aren't rational. The smallest extension of the rational numbers in which I can find every single root is (in this case) Q\\[sqrt(2)\\]. That means that if I wanted to write that polynomial in factored form, the smallest place I could do it is in Q\\[sqrt(2)\\]. We say that this polynomial is \"solvable\" because I can write it in factored form in some extension of Q which I get to by adding roots. (There's nothing special about only adjoining root 2. I could adjoin any nth root of any rational number, and I could do that as many times as I want. So, something like Q\\[sqrt(2), cube root(1252), sqrt(34564)\\] is also a radical extension, and a polynomial which splits into linear factors in that extension would also be solvable).   Now let's turn to group theory. A group is just a set of symmetries of something -- it's all the ways you can reorder a thing and preserve it in some way. For example, the set of reorderings of the numbers (1,2) is a group containing the elements \"do nothing\" and \"switch 1 and 2.\" Certain groups have a property called \"solvability\" which is technical and seemingly unmotivated. Let's treat it as a black box.   Now, Galois theory relates extensions like Q\\[sqrt 2\\] to groups in a very precise way. For each extension, you can find a unique polynomial which factors linearly over that extension \\*and\\* when you combine all the factors, you get a polynomial with coefficients in Q \\*and\\* is as small (low degree) as possible. In the Q\\[sqrt 2\\] example, that polynomial is x\\^2-2 and it's called the minimal polynomial. The Galois group of the extension is the group which swaps all the roots of the minimal polynomial between each other (in a coherent way). For Q\\[sqrt 2\\], the Galois group is the group which can do 2 things: nothing, or swap sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2), and leave everything else the same. What that means is that the group \"acts\" on the extension. Say I take the group element g which swaps the roots. Then I can apply that element to a random element a + b sqrt(2) of Q\\[sqrt 2\\]. Then g(a+bsqrt(2)) = a-b sqrt(2), because I switch the roots and leave everything else the same.   If that group has the \"solvable\" property, then that polynomial is \"solvable\". Ie, I can write all of its roots in some extension of Q that I get to only by adding some nth roots. The same thing works in reverse: If I can solve a polynomial only by adding nth roots, then the galois group of that extension is solvable. If one of those conditions fails, then the other one must fail as well.   What Galois showed is that every possible group associated to a field where the degree of the minimal polynomial is less than 5 is solvable, but that some groups bigger than that are not solvable. So that implies that every polynomial of degree < 5 is such that every solution is a radical expression, but not every polynomial of degree >= 5 satisfies that.",

Suppose I am a fruit seller, and I sell apples, oranges and pears, but not peaches.  Late in the afternoon, I have sold all of my apples, but still have a few oranges and pears left.  A guy comes up to me and asks me what I sell.  I tell him I have oranges and pears.  The guy tells me he wants to buy apples and peaches.  I explain to him that although I have neither apples nor peaches right now, I do sell apples, and if he comes back tomorrow I will have some apples for sale, but I never sell peaches.  I decide rather than having to explain this to every customer I will have a sign that tells people what I have available to buy, so the next day I have a blackboard in front of my stall and write apples: 15, oranges: 23, pears: 17.  As the day goes on, and I sell my fruit, I change the numbers so that as I sell the fruit, people passing by know what I have left to buy.  At some point I sell my last apple.  I want to be able to indicate that although I don't have any apples right now, I do sell them, and if they come back tomorrow I will have some more, but I want to make that distinct from the fact that I do not sell peaches.  If I can write apples: 0, oranges: 5, pears: 3, it says something different from saying oranges: 5, pears: 3, because it indicates that although I have no apples right now, I still do sell apples.  That might be a somewhat trivial example, but the ability to indicate that I have zero of something as distinct from not having it allows for a useful distinction to be made.

This is because the smallest object your eye can perceive does _not_ depend on the actual size of the object, but rather what proportion of your field of view that object makes up.   A [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity) referenced by Wikipedia gives the maximum *angular* resolution of the human eye (with no visual defects and good lighting) as 0.008 degrees. If we take this value to be accurate, and assume you are looking at a screen 1m away, this corresponds to a pixel size of approximately 0.14mm.   For a 27\" 16:9 monitor, this means that the maximum resolution you could make out (at a viewing distance of 1m) is around 4300x2400, which is a bit more than 4K. The larger the monitor and nearer it is to your screen, the higher the resolution you'll be able to distinguish.",

    "answer": "> Before the 19th century, countries were simply declaring endless wars for the most useless motivations and would only receive a retaliation from the country's allies and your rivals.  This is just totally incorrect.   The 7 years war (1756\u20131763) was all about the balance of power between Brittan and France and spilled over into the balance of power in central Europe resulting in the emergence of Prussia at the expense of Austria and Sweden.  The war of the Spanish succession (1701-1714) Was about the HRE being too powerful and every one ganging up to strip Spain off from it.   The 30 years (1618 to 1648) was all about the balance of power between the big players of Europe. Namely the HRE and France.  The 100 years (1337\u20131453) drew in Scotland, Aragon, Castile and Bohemia, on the French side to stop England from conquering France.  There are a huge number of wars (650c-1000c) between the Eastern roman empire and like every eastern European state known to man over how far roman influence would be.

    "question": "ELI5: What is bandwidth? (literally)",
    "answer": "> And then you can modulate the wave so it carries data. For digital modulation, that means you vary the amplitude or power level of the transmission.  And/or you can vary the frequency or phase. In FM transmission, you would change your 2400MHz signal up or down by up to 10MHz, and your 'bandwidth' would be just that - your band width, the difference between the lowest and highest frequency you're sending.  Other modulation schemes which use phase and amplitude together are in use too. One example is [QAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation).  If you're transmitting a digital AM signal by pulsing a single carrier frequency on and off, then your bandwidth is the result of a tradeoff based on how fast you're pulsing on and off relative to the frequency of the carrier wave. If you're pulsing a carrier wave on and off very fast, approaching the frequency of the carrier itself, then the spectrum of what you're sending gets quite wide. If you transmit a pure 2400MHz signal at constant level forever, never stopping or starting, then that would be a 0 bandwidth signal, a pure frequency. But when the signal is stopping and starting, the band gets wider than 0. This is just a mathematical consequence of how frequencies work.

Likewise, there's not a Sony PS5 factory. Instead, Sony has to rent out the use of a factory ahead of time for, say two weeks, and during those two weeks the factory will make PS5s.

    "answer": "We dont fully understand the way cells store and retrieve memories, but I can give an overview based off what we do know. Keep in mind the brain is incredibly complex and we have multiple structures interacting here.. Certain brain cells (groups of neurons and synapses) can be chained together to react to a specific stimuli delivered from the brain. Because of this, one system of the brain can \"tell\" a group of cells to react a specific way in the future. In the case of memory, the brain structure responsible for memory formation tells a group of brain cells to react a specific way to another stiumuli: the one triggered by the memory retrieval system.   So one system has the ability to tell brain cells how to form memories, and another knows how to send out an impulse to relieve that memory, and interpret it. But this in turn triggers a bunch of other systems: the ones responsible for how we perceive the world. Our brain is really good at simulating a world we can navigate based on stimuli. We really don't interact with the world, but a simulation our brain comes up with. So that same ability can be applied to generate something without any external stimuli, such as the memory retrieval system.  So the full loop ends up being outside stimuli are taken in, the world perception is formed, the memory formation system stores it in some brain cells, the memory retrieval system triggers a retrieval, and the world perception system can be leveraged to take that stimuli and make yourself perceive the sound of Arnold Schwarzenegger quotes or whatever.

    "answer": "It\u2019s not bad to take a hot shower during a fever, it\u2019s just uncomfortable. At the same time, taking a cold shower is not recommended because as your skin (periphery) cools down due to cold water, the body tries to compensate by increasing your core (inside) temperature which we don\u2019t want in a patient already suffering from fever. Hence lukewarm water is the best for this situation.  Now there are chemical compounds called pyrogens (molecules that cause fever). Usually the process goes like this : bacteria/virus/microorganisms enter our body, body/immune system detects certain proteins and chemical structures on them (like the cell wall,etc), sends a signal to the brain, brain is like oops need to kill that, need more ammo, so they release some other substances/chemical compounds which further activates the immune system.  Now both the microorganisms and the brain/immune system\u2019s compounds are what we call pyrogens.  So exogenous ( from outside) pyrogens like bacteria give rise to endogenous (from inside the body) pyrogens like the immune system cells which increases the body temperature level just the way you adjust the thermostat to a higher setting.

Just apply XOR again to flip the correct bits back.  XOR(A, B) = C -> XOR(C, B) = A  This number isn't truly random. It's generated by an algorithm from a password (or Key).

So you take your YFG-HA gene, put it into a vector for expression, and put that vector into cells.  Your gene gets transcribed and translated by the cells that have your vector, and they make a whole bunch of YFG-HA protein.  Now, how to purify it?  First, you burst all your cells with soap and shred them apart into a uniform protein soup.  Then, you take an antibody against the HA tag which binds it tightly, and you stick a coating of that antibody to tiny sand-sized plastic beads. You put those beads into a column, and run your protein soup through it. Your YFG-HA protein sticks to the antibodies on the beads while everything else runs through.  You put a few rinses of fluid through the plastic sand to really clean up those YFG-HA proteins trapped in there, then you run a different liquid through that breaks the antibody's bond to the HA tag, and you flush out a clean and pure solution of YFG-HA protein.",

    "question": "ELI5: Given the many layers of checks and balances in the court system, how can 1-5% of innocent people end up in prison for crimes they didn\u2019t commit?",
    "answer": "Human error has a lot to do with this, really. Even after taking out all the biases people have in general, such as accusing someone based off their physical appearance, and a lot of circumstantial evidence making a case, you'd still get those wrongful convictions (probably a lot less, but you'd still get them.)  There are two major causes of these.  The first one is the fact that human memory is complete and utter garbage, and can be modified by repetition of alternate facts. This has been proven time and time again, where a police officer repeatedly smashing you with facts about a crime you didn't commit, may lead you to believe you actually did.  This further extends to dubious and faulty memory of events. Many wrongful convictions depend on witnesses misidentifying the culprit, as their brain sees the accused, and if they look close enough to the actual culprit, they will identify them as if they were, because minute differences do not register unless you put the two side by side. Likewise, other details may be super vague, and mis-remembered or misquoted. Often, all you remember is \"the man robbed a bank, and he looked a bit like this\", because your brain needs to remember this for survival reasons, but the rest of the details won't even be remotely in there. This explains the reason why if you are in a similar situation to a crime, you will be also suddenly a bit more anxious, as if the crime was about to happen again. Survival instinct is a fickle thing that hurts all this stuff.  And then, we get to the second major cause: Plea deals. This one is probably the biggest culprit, and it basically goes like this.  You get arrested for (let's say) drug trafficking charges. You know you didn't do it, but somehow, they found a pound of cocaine in your car. While you're struggling with the confusion of \"how the hell did that get there\", and \"who the hell do you know might have left it there for you to be screwed over\", an officer comes in for interrogation, and tries to coax a confession out of you. They say they found the cocaine, they say that through a few contacts, they have witnesses to say you're guilty, and to boot, they found your fingerprints on the cocaine's bag.  After a few hours of back and forth and forth and back of you telling them you wouldn't even know where to get cocaine, and them saying that they have all this evidence, the confession is only a formality at this point, but they still want it, because \"confessing goes a long way in reducing your sentence\", since it means you admit and know that what you did was wrong... Well, they drop in the bomb: If you admit that it is your cocaine, they can drop the charge from drug trafficking, to drug possession, whose sentence is much lighter, so that's sort of meeting halfway. Tired, annoyed, and honestly just wanting to be done with this, you accept the deal, write and sign a confession, and they send you either to the station's cell, or home (often with bail), awaiting the formality that is the trial.  At this point, they have everything they need: They have heavily circumstantial evidence, that is corroborated by you confessing. Suddenly, you get a year in jail for a crime you don't even know how to commit, because honestly, it's better than the alternative of being in jail for drug trafficking... And that's how you got wrongfully convicted.  That kind of scenario happens a lot more often than you probably think, with more and more police officers being caught planting evidence they \"find\" in a car they are ssearching (often illegally) thanks to their body cams. This can also land the same way with murder, but the steps that have to be taken are very different, since there isn't really a step down they usually get you to in order to get there.  Those are the main two culprits of wrongful convictions.",

Higher molecular weight, less flexibility. Some materials with high molecular weight are great (UHMW polyethylene, for example), some aren\u2019t useful past a certain point. Nylon in SLS 3D printing, for example, gains molecular weight with continued heating, and isn\u2019t useful at high molecular weight.   Some polymers can be melted and reused, many times, if correctly re-melted. Some polymers don\u2019t work like this. Depends on the processing and the temperatures used, as well as on the chemical structure of the plastics. Some of that is related to whether the polymer is a _semicrystalline polymer_, or an _amorphous polymer_ (which is getting more scientific than I think the initial question was intended). Amorphous polymers can be more easily recycled than semicrystalline.",

[It's actually 4 different chambers](https://breathefreely.com/pasha-chamber-of-sinuses/) (2 for each nostril) for the majority of the population (there's an estimated 10% of the population that have 6 sinus chambers/3 per nostril).  So the short and simple of it is that any of the 4 chambers could be inflamed at any given time causing the 'stuffy nose' symptom in one or both nostrils. But, your body is pretty good about making sure you keep breathing (unless you have sleep apnea) so it regulates the erectile tissue in each side of your sinus to usually make sure you can breath out of one of them.   To get a little deeper into it, the process of warming and humidifying the air you're breathing into your lungs through your nose is energy and resource intensive so your body only sends the extra blood to one nostril at a time. But this extra blood causes the tissue to swell (kind of like when you injure your skin and the area around it swells because of the increased blood flow to the injury) and when you're sick you already have increased blood flow to the infection in your sinuses and this increases the stuffiness on the side your body is trying to regulate the air quality in.

When water is liquid, the molecules are all jumbled up while they're vibrating (imagine wildly shaking a box full of V-shaped puzzle pieces).  The molecules can't make any hydrogen bonds because the vibrating is too strong and they'll break apart.  When water starts to cool off, the molecules do get a little closer together, but there's still too much vibrating to let the hydrogen bonds form (imagine the puzzle pieces are gently shaking themselves into a smaller pile inside the box). But once it's cold enough, there isn't enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds apart.

    "answer": "There are two ways you can write up the netcode for a game. You can either handle the button presses when they were originally pressed, or you can handle them when they get to the central server.  Let's say you're starting with the central server timing. This is also referred to as Delay-Based. If you press a button on your screen, until you receive an acknowledgement from the server that the button was pressed, nothing happens. This creates a lag that you have to overcome that just isn't present with in-person gaming, and is going to vary greatly depending on your connection at the time. However, everything you see on your screen is guaranteed to be what actually happens.  The other way, handling buttons based on when they were originally pushed, is what is referred to as rollback.  Imagine each button press gets sent to the server with a timestamp. Your local game can start playing the actions right away, because it expects that the server will accept that button press at that time.  When it gets to the server, it will look at the timestamp of the button press. If it has already done any calculations for any button presses later than that, then it rolls back those button presses, adds the new one, and then replays them, and sends the correction to both clients.  This means that you effectively always get your button press at the time you pressed it, without weird lag making it much later than you intended. This also means that, if there is substantial lag, you can see the game stutter as it corrects itself, but if there is very little lag, then everything appears very smooth for both players, making them feel as if it's a local game.",

Nevertheless, the ratings board may still award a PG-13 rating passed by a two-thirds majority if they believe the language is justified by the context or by the manner in which the words are used.**  >**There are several exceptional cases in which PG-13-rated films contain multiple occurrences of the word fuck:** Adventures in Babysitting, where the word is used twice in the same scene;The Hip Hop Project, which has seventeen uses; and Gunner Palace, a documentary of soldiers in the Second Gulf War, which has 42 uses of the word with two used sexually. Both Bully, a 2011 documentary about bullying, and Philomena\u2014which has two instances of the word\u2014released in 2013, were originally given R ratings on grounds of the language but the ratings were dropped to PG-13 after successful appeals.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system",

    "question": "ELI5: what is the exact science of how the electrode precipitator machines work that the alkaline water filter companies use to scare you into buying their $8k water filtration system?",
    "answer": "Here's what happens: Chemically pure water doesn't conduct electricity by itself, deionized and distilled water are very poor conductors as well due to the very low electrolyte (mostly salts) concentration. So when you put a pair of electrodes in a cup containing some pure water or deionized water and try to let an electrical current flow, nothing happens. But then again, every day water is not chemically pure nor deionized (and there's no in-home system capable of obtaining that and there's no point in doing that).  If you were to add let's say table salt into the former system, then it would become an electrolytic cell, and chemical reactions would take place into the electrodes; specifically a reduction in the cathode and an oxidation on the anode. This is the point where the scam gets in action: the electrodes in the cell are made from metals, commonly aluminum and copper, copper gets oxidized because of it's reduction potential, therefore forming copper ions in solution.   There are many other reactions that could occur depending on the salts naturally dissolved in water, and all those reactions cross-react with copper ions (and any other harmless ions that might be in drinking water), forming a very chemically-diverse precipitate with a dark foul-color; giving the false idea that the tap water is filthy and unsafe, when in truth the electrodes are to blame.  On a side note, if both electrodes were made from platinum (a very chemically stable metal) you wouldn't see anything but a bubbling indicating water electrolysis into pure hydrogen and oxygen, no foul colors, no anything, because platinum won't oxidize in that setup.  In conclusion, as you already noted it, it's only a ruse to scare people into buying something.",

    "answer": "The structure of gas giants isn't well understood yet and likely won't be until we can send probes into the atmosphere.   It's very likely that under the atmospheric layer lies a comparatively thin ocean of liquid helium and trace amounts of other liquids. This ocean will be contantly boiling off as more liquified gases rain down from above.  Under the ocean lies a huge rocky planet structure far larger than the inner planets. This rocky core will have a very thin crust that will be contantly broken apart, melted and reformed by the huge amouts of nuclear decay in the core and by the tidal heating of the orbiting moons.  Despite the fact that there's an ocean of liquid helium sitting on top, the planet's core is generating so much heat that the crust can't remain solid.

    "answer": "Incorrect!   The prefix post- doesn't mean \"rejection of\" in labelling these kinds of philosophical and artistic movements, but rather more \"acceptance of and progression from.\" So post-modernism is an acceptance of and progression from some of the things you attribute to it here.  To understand modernity and modernism as a broad ideology, it helps to consider the early 20thC context, where colonial atrocities and the horrors of WWI were starting to be hard to ignore for intellectuals. Modernists were intrinsically disillusioned by the old grand truths (or metanarratives) of the Western world: War is honourable. Religion is Civilization. Science is Progress. Modernists skewed nihilist. They sought to represent reality with granular truth, not grand truth, in formally innovative ways, and if the outcome was against moralistic messages of the past, so be it.  Post-modernism came about not as a rejection of this, but more as an acceptance that our structures and metanarratives, however illusionary,  are how we create meaning. They just tend to approach these grand institutions ironically (think a screenprinted soup can on an art gallery's wall: it's not denying cultural values, it's just trying to re-evaluate them in interesting ways. Or a Tarantino film that uses a generic Western franchise in homage, but also to discuss race by revising history). So where modernism was dismissive of grand narratives (like the American Dream), post-modernism is generally more playful. A lot of what we call post-modern is actually just modern, mind you.",

    "question": "ELI5: How does an EMP work?",
    "answer": "When a nuclear weapon goes off it releases a huge amount of UV/Xrays/Gamma rays which move outward and smack into electrons of air molecules with enough energy to knock them loose and send the electrons flying.  This huge and sudden current of electrons quickly moving away from the center point creates a suddenly changing magnetic field.  We use this feature in transformers and wireless chargers.  If you change a current it creates a changing magnetic field which can be coupled into a nearby wire to create a current in that wire so you can pass power wirelessly.  For nuclear EMPs \"nearby\" is hundreds of miles away and the changing magnetic field is insanely strong.  The US did a test called [Starfish Prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_Prime) where they detonated a nuke about 400 km up(roughly the height of the space station which didn't exist yet).     Starfish Prime ended up creating a field over Hawaii (900 miles away) that was 5600 Volts/meter which means a 10 meter long power line would generate 56,000 volts at the end of it.  This is pretty bad for power lines and blew out a few hundred streetlights, but it was really before the era of microelectronics.  A 5mm long trace in your smart phone would have experienced 28 volts which is pretty devastating to a system expecting to run at less than 5 volts.

Destructive interference is when the peak of one wave meets the valley of the other and the energy cancels out.  Noise cancelling headphones work on destructive interference. They use a tiny microphone on the outside of the headphones in order to detect outside sound. They usually focus on deep bass sounds as they have the best chance of penetrating the headphones.

Buildings and bridges have factors of safety of 4-6 generally.  So if you're building a bridge that should support 100 tons then you design it to support 600 tons so any variations in construction, or material (micro cracks or imperfections), or even dynamic loading(hurricane winds or an overloaded truck) won't be enough to overwhelm it.  Weight doesn't matter in non-moving applications so go extra strong and you don't need to do all the precise calculation and it'll last for a longgg time.  Airplanes are probably the thing with the lowest factor of safety, often only around 1.5 because weight matters a lot to airplanes.  The trade off here is that the materials are extensively studied, highly controlled, and the applications they're going into are well modeled so they know exactly how much force will be applied to the components.  If you have the time/money to over analyze every part of your system then you can trim it back, but a lot of engineering designs are \"how much will X weigh?  No more than 5?

    "answer": "Lots of eli12 in this thread.  I'll take a stab at lowering that to 5  'grounding' is basically needed to ensure that everything is at the same 'electrical level' (voltage).The hazard of not grounding something is that if the electrical level (voltage) is different in one place compared to another and you touch both, it becomes level by going through you (not good). So as long as everything you touch is all the same level it won't go through you because there is nowhere for it to go. As long as everything in the ISS is all connected to the frame so that it is all the same level (voltage) you are safe.  This is why if a utility truck touches a power line and a worker gets out and touches the truck (high level/voltage) and the ground (low level/voltage) at the same time the electricity goes through their body and shocks them badly. If their co-worker JUMPS onto the ground and is never the bridge between the two levels (voltages) at the same time, they will be safe.

    "question": "ELI5: what do Galois groups actually prove about solvability?",
    "answer": "It is a bit complicated but let me try. First, there's two notions called \"solvability,\" one for polynomials and one for groups (I'll explain what groups are later). They'll turn out to be very intimately related, although it may not look like it from the get go. First let me explain the polynomial side of things, it might be a bit easier to grasp.  Ok, so start with a field (we usually take Q, so if you're not sure what the general definition of a field is, just picture rational numbers). You can ask yourself \"what's the smallest set containing Q and some real number that isn't in Q which has a coherent addition and multiplication such that all the \"nice\" properties hold (distributivity, commutativity, associativity, additive and multiplicative inverses)? For example, what's the smallest \"nice\" set (field) containing Q and sqrt(2)? Well, it turns out the best you can do is take all of Q and add all rational multiples of sqrt(2), so you end up with a set consisting of all rational numbers, all rational multiples of sqrt(2), and all possible sums of those. So, \u00bd is an element. So is 3/4xsqrt(2), and so is 4/435435+ 32/9sqrt(2). More generally, any element can be written as a+bsqrt(2), for a and b rational numbers. That set is written Q\\[sqrt(2)\\] (Q adjoin root 2).   Now, I may want to solve a polynomial like x\\^2 -2. The roots as you know are sqrt 2 and - sqrt 2, so they aren't rational. The smallest extension of the rational numbers in which I can find every single root is (in this case) Q\\[sqrt(2)\\]. That means that if I wanted to write that polynomial in factored form, the smallest place I could do it is in Q\\[sqrt(2)\\]. We say that this polynomial is \"solvable\" because I can write it in factored form in some extension of Q which I get to by adding roots. (There's nothing special about only adjoining root 2. I could adjoin any nth root of any rational number, and I could do that as many times as I want. So, something like Q\\[sqrt(2), cube root(1252), sqrt(34564)\\] is also a radical extension, and a polynomial which splits into linear factors in that extension would also be solvable).   Now let's turn to group theory. A group is just a set of symmetries of something -- it's all the ways you can reorder a thing and preserve it in some way. For example, the set of reorderings of the numbers (1,2) is a group containing the elements \"do nothing\" and \"switch 1 and 2.\" Certain groups have a property called \"solvability\" which is technical and seemingly unmotivated. Let's treat it as a black box.   Now, Galois theory relates extensions like Q\\[sqrt 2\\] to groups in a very precise way. For each extension, you can find a unique polynomial which factors linearly over that extension \\*and\\* when you combine all the factors, you get a polynomial with coefficients in Q \\*and\\* is as small (low degree) as possible. In the Q\\[sqrt 2\\] example, that polynomial is x\\^2-2 and it's called the minimal polynomial. The Galois group of the extension is the group which swaps all the roots of the minimal polynomial between each other (in a coherent way). For Q\\[sqrt 2\\], the Galois group is the group which can do 2 things: nothing, or swap sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2), and leave everything else the same. What that means is that the group \"acts\" on the extension. Say I take the group element g which swaps the roots. Then I can apply that element to a random element a + b sqrt(2) of Q\\[sqrt 2\\]. Then g(a+bsqrt(2)) = a-b sqrt(2), because I switch the roots and leave everything else the same.   If that group has the \"solvable\" property, then that polynomial is \"solvable\". Ie, I can write all of its roots in some extension of Q that I get to only by adding some nth roots. The same thing works in reverse: If I can solve a polynomial only by adding nth roots, then the galois group of that extension is solvable. If one of those conditions fails, then the other one must fail as well.   What Galois showed is that every possible group associated to a field where the degree of the minimal polynomial is less than 5 is solvable, but that some groups bigger than that are not solvable. So that implies that every polynomial of degree < 5 is such that every solution is a radical expression, but not every polynomial of degree >= 5 satisfies that.",

You can't fully relax in a car because muscles in your back and abdomen are constantly responding to the little lateral forces produced by handling the car. Depending on the size of the plane and the air conditions, the same might be true on a flight.  Finally, the sensory input can be mentally exhausting. Highway driving is noisy, and can expose you to pretty fast-moving visual scenery which, even if you're not really paying attention to it, your brain might be noticing and spending some energy on. Planes in flight are also very loud places to be. That can wear you down and push you toward mental fatigue.",

    "answer": "It's not exactly your ears making adjustments, but your brain.   What exactly those adjustments are is complicated, but it probably involves:   Beam forming: by adding up the sound coming though your right and left ear with a slight delay, you can boost the signal to noise ratio of sounds coming from a given direction (though with only two ears it'll be a sort of conical donut shape).   Reverb analysis: your brain has been trained from birth to recognise how the shape of your ear (and the rest of your body for that matter) bounces around sounds coming from different directions and can use this to focus on sounds coming from a specific direction (or more often tell which direction sounds are coming from).   Frequency analysis: if you're listening to two (average, young) women talking to each other, you can ignore all the frequencies not related to human speech or too low for (most) women to use.   Pattern recognition: if you're listening to two people speaking a language you know, your brain can use your knowledge of that language to predict what's most likely to be said next given the context of the conversation so far, and pick whatever word fits most closely to the raw sound your ears are reporting.  At least those are the methods used by computers to do the same thing. Except for the reverb thing, that's still really hard to do for computers while the human brain is absolutely fantastic at it.",

When I was a student, we had this one gentleman that refused to see a primary care doctor because his ER visit copay was $0. So every month when his blood pressure meds ran low, he would walk into the ER and get a prescription for blood pressure meds. Imagine how much each visit would cost the insurance company. Now if only the insurance company would put some kind of \"petty and dumb sum of money\" that is greater than a non ER doctor visit. This could reduce strain onto the healthcare system.

The simplest is called the \u201cc scale\u201d (because it starts and ends on c) C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C. On a piano, it is only white keys.  Now it gets more complicated, and if you aren\u2019t gonna be playing music, this might be less helpful, but there is a formula to figure out a scale. It goes \u201cwhole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step. This is a little tricky, but it\u2019ll help you figure out any scale starting on any note. A \u201chalf step,\u201d is going from one note to the next. If you are on a piano, this would usually be going from a white key to the black one next to it. A whole step is just made of two half steps.

    "question": "ELI5: What is Internet of Things mean (IoT) and how it works?",
    "answer": "Put really simply, \"Internet of Things\" is the idea that a lot of devices we use could be exposed to and controlled by a network and that this could be a good thing.  For example, having a lamp connected to the internet sounds silly to begin with, but it lets you create a remote control for the lamp. It's not that remote controls for lamps don't already exist, but they tend to use radio signals or infrared and both of these have line of sight and range problems. Having web-enabled doodads in the house means you can check if you left the oven on from the store and, if so, turn it off. Or, if you see a great deal on a roast while shopping but it's kind of late, you can start the oven preheating before you leave. Or, if you plan to arrive home after dark, you don't have to *leave* lights on, you can turn them on when you approach from outside.   The \"how it works\" is a bit of a mess right now. A lot of devices use their own special \"language\". For example, my fridge has internet-related features, but I can only control it from a specific app the manufacturer makes. My thermostat is internet-enabled, but interfaces with Amazon Alexa so I have more choices about how to control it. But there are some other \"languages\" that are more open, and devices that use those can be controlled from a lot of different apps or other devices.  There are lots of rainbow-tinted unicorn fantasies about how great it would be if every device were internet enabled. But whether it's a good thing or not really comes down to who implements it, how they implement it, and what they do with it.  For example, it'd be GREAT if my fridge could tell me its inside temperature regularly and how long it's running. Then I could use programs to perform analysis and notice if it seems to be malfunctioning. Instead, the only thing I can really do with the app is change the set temperature or get an alarm if the door is open for too long. Even if it had the features I wanted, it speaks its own language to its own special app so I couldn't access the data in a way that lets me use it.   Alternatively, my thermostat has both Alexa control *and* an API that I can use to access its data. Because of that API, I can write programs to analyze the data for me. I use a program someone else wrote to keep track of how my A/C is performing and to help me understand if it needs maintenance. This is a good thing!   Obviously people are concerned about security. There's a long way to go on that front.   In theory, some day, I'll be able to run ONE application that manages all of my devices. Where we are now, that's a bit of a pipe dream. Google has its own thing, Amazon has its own thing, Apple has its own thing, and a dozen vendors have their own thing.

Unions create division and stress in the workplace between management and workers because workers no longer do whatever they are told, they only do what is spelled out in the contract ( for example, a contract may state that the worker can refuse overtime, a manager might need someone to work overtime, the worker has the right to refuse, the worker might need the money, his union brothers might not want anyone to work overtime, leaving the worker with a moral dilemma)    I find that unions are good if the job is a skilled trade.

That can take a variety of shapes, from including a repairing agent mixed into the material that takes some form of action in response to damage, to having the material re-form completely by itself.  In the case of plastics: pretty much all plastics are some sort of polymer. That means they're made up of many repeated small units (monomers), each connected to the next in some way. Self-healing plastics have the ability to re-form certain bonds under normal operating circumstances (as opposed to \"normal\" plastics where you'd create and shape the material under high temperatures, pressures etc in a specific factory environment).

    "answer": "There are actually many genes involved in balding, some connected to the x chromosome and some the y. The main baldness  gene is found to be on the maternal x chromosome. So if you are male, you inherited your x chromosome from your mom. So the likelihood of you becoming bald is fairly high if your mom's dad was bald. But remember your mom has two x chromosomes so she may not have passed on the gene to her male child.  The male child may have gotten the mom's x chromosome that doesn't carry the gene. So just because your mom's dad is bald doesn't mean you will be but your chances are higher. Now if your y chromosome,  which you get from your dad, carries one of those other baldness genes NOT related to the x chromosome,  you still have a chance of being bald even if you did not inherit your mother's chromosome that has the main baldness gene. So, If your maternal grandfather is bald you have a high likelihood of going bald. If your dad is bald too, you have an even higher chance of being bald because he may be bald due to a gene on his Y chromosome that causes baldness.",

    "answer": "The fold in the eyelid you are describing is called the epicanthic fold. it's associated with greater levels of fat deposition around the eyeball, a feature that is the most prominent in native North Siberian, Aleutian and Inuit populations. The extra tissue is thought to provide greater insulation for the eye and sinuses from the effects of cold, especially from freezing winds, and to represent an adaptation to cold climates. That means that in extreme temperatures, their faces would be more protected from sub-zero temperatures which could freeze the nose, lips, eyelids and severely irritate and cause cold injuries to the sinuses. It has also been suggested that the fold itself may provide a level of protection from snow blindness. In extreme periods of cold, those who could see best in blinding sunlight reflecting off of snow and ice could hunt most successfully.  its appearance in peoples of Southeast Asia can be linked to possible descent from cold-adapted ancestors, its occurrence in various African peoples doesn't follow a cold-adaptive explanation for it appearing in the latter groups. The epicanthic fold found in the san African people has been tentatively linked to protection for the eye from the high levels of ultraviolet light found in desert and semi-desert areas. That's not dissimilar to an advantage in snow and ice covered environments.

    "answer": "These new laws are intending to deregulate the farmers markets to make it easier for private investors and traders to trade in food products and hopefully increase the productivity of the farmers. However the regulation that was in place was there to protect the farmers and consumers from volatile prices. All countries in the world do regulate food production to some degree. The US and Canada have maybe some of the least regulated markets but it is still regulated fairly much. A vital part of the New Deal plan to get the US out of the depression in the 30s were agricultural regulations. And the US have demonstrated that the markets are unable to handle completely unregulated essential products when they deregulated power production in California during the Enron scandal. So the regulation is important to ensure that farmers will get paid at harvest and that consumers will see food in the stores. The complaint against the Indian government is that the new laws will not be able to do this and even though they will open up the markets to speculators they do not work with the market to ensure a steady supply and demand of food.",

Instead, water causes refraction.....when light hits water it slows down, this slow down changes the direction light is traveling.    In the case of a pool, the surface often has some waves to it...even if they're really tiny waves and it looks completely still it's likely still moving to some degree. This movement causes light to constantly be drawn in different directions as it passes through the surface of the water. This constantly changing direction of light acts almost like a disco ball, causing high and low amounts of light to hit different parts of the floor at the same time, which causes dark and light spots to appear, creating \"shadows\".

    "answer": "So the answer is a bit complicated, here is the ELI5. We are normally taught in school that reproduction works like this (in humans), Females have XX, males have XY, and the child is some combination of those X and Y chromosomes.  &#x200B;  Now, most people assume that you get one of two X chromosomes from your mother, and either the X or Y chromosome from your father. However, that would give you a tiny amount of 4 unique combinations if it was that simple. If you have ever known family that has more than 4 kids, you can tell that reproduction must be more complicated than that since you don't end up with \"duplicate\" kids.   &#x200B;  Now, whiptail lizards are special even among animals that asexually reproduce. Instead of a normal \"clone\" they basically are able to act like the mother and father. Imagine taking two eggs, (instead of an egg and sperm) and making an embryo from it. So it would be as if you had a pair of twins who had a baby together. Just like there are more than 4 options in human reproduction, a pair of twins would not necessarily produce identical offspring (for instance, both of them could have one dominant gene and one recessive gene. If they both contributed the recessive gene, their offspring would have 2 recessive genes, and look different).  &#x200B;  Now the genetic diversity is still less than you might expect in a sexually reproducing species, but it does allow the species to have more variety than you might expect.",

It just makes it so germs in the water die before you drink it. Interestingly, exactly why it does this is poorly understood, though it is known that iodine attacks a lot of the chemical compounds that germs need to function.  Iodine does not build up in your body, at least not long term. In fact, iodine is the heaviest element that your body has a use for and you need (very small) amounts of it to live. So some small amount will be incorporated, at least for a bit, into your body and that\u2019s a good thing! If you don\u2019t get enough, you can even get [a disease called \u201ciodine deficiency\u201d](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_deficiency).

Drinking a few drops might cause some burns before it dilutes down. I don\u2019t recommend it.  There exist radioactive isotopes of iodine (and all other elements), but they are not found in nature. Nuclear weapons and accidents can release a lot of these radioactive forms of iodine, though.

    "question": "ELI5: Once a lottery like Mega Millions has a high enough jackpot so that the expected value of the ticket is higher than the cost, why does it still feel like it\u2019s a bad investment to buy a ticket?",
    "answer": "Let's simplify things and consider a lottery that just has one big jackpot and no other prizes. Let's say the odds of winning this jackpot are 1 in 300 million (that's roughly the [odds](https://www.megamillions.com/How-to-Play.aspx) for getting all the numbers right to win the Mega Millions jackpot). Instead of drawing a set of numbers, let's say you just roll a 300 million-sided die and you win the jackpot if it comes up '1'. Let's say the jackpot is $1 billion and it costs $2 for each roll of the die.  Your expected winnings per roll are $1 billion / 300 million = $3.33. Clearly, that's more than it costs and so statistically you expect to make a profit. That is, if you could roll the die enough times, your winnings would equal $3.33 per roll, for a profit of $1.33 per roll. For instance, if you were able to play 1 trillion times, you'd almost certainly make a profit close to $1.33 trillion.  The problem, of course, is that you can't afford to play 1 trillion times. You have neither the time nor the upfront cash to finance that. So it doesn't matter how the statistics work out in the long run. The important thing is: is there a reasonable probability that you'll make a return on your investment before either your time or your money runs out?   Clearly, you need to win the jackpot at least once in order to have a chance to make a profit. Note that you're not guaranteed to make a profit once you win - if it takes too many rolls, you'll still be making a loss. But if you don't win even once, you'll certainly make a loss.  So how often do you need to roll the die to win the jackpot at least once? Well, it's never a sure thing that you'll win, but let's say we want to have at least an 80% probability. How often do we need to roll the die for that? The probability that you'll wint the jackpot at least once in N rolls is 1-p^(N) where p is the probability of not winning, i.e. 1-(1/300 million). So we have to solve 1-p^(N) = 0.8, i.e. p^(N) = 0.2. We can solve this by taking the logarithm of 0.2 in base *p*. If none of that makes sense to you, don't worry, just note that this is a mathematical way of answering the question: how many times do I need to roll this die so that I'll have an 80% probability of winning the jackpot at least once?  The answer turns out to be over 482 million times. That's an investment of $964 million, not to mention how much time it takes to roll a die that many times.  And therein lies the rub. You do not have the time nor the money to play the lottery enough times to have any reasonable hope of making a return on your investment. Not to mention, how are you even going to buy that many lottery tickets? They don't stock that many at your local corner store, and I doubt that Mega Millions is going to allow you to purchase that many tickets from them directly.  Also, note that even with 482 million rolls, there's still a 20% chance that you don't win the jackpot, and then you've accumulated losses of almost $1 trillion. To really be sure of a profit, you need to be playing tens of billions of times.  **In short, the problem is that the expected profit comes from a teenie, tiny probability of winning a large amount of money. If you had a 50% probability of winning $6.66 on a ticket that costs $2, the expected profit would also be $1.33 per ticket, only then you'd only have to play like a dozen times in order to be pretty sure of a profit. So it's not about the expected value of the winnings distribution, it's about how uneven it is.**",

    "question": "ELI5: Why are v8 engines over 5 liters in size common but i4 engines over 2.5 liters are very uncommon?",
    "answer": "I4 engines have excellent Primary Balance characteristics, meaning vibration due to the up-down motion of the pistons cancels each other out. It's easy to see why this works in animations of such engines.  However i4 engines have unusually poor *Second-Order Balance.*   Second-Order balance, also called secondary balance is related to the inevitable side-to-side rocking motion of the connecting rods. This motion causes the center of mass of the connecting rod to not move perfectly in sync with the CM of the piston. Rather, the connecting rod CM moves closer to the top surface of piston by a few mm, at the middle of the stroke then back again at bottom and top dead center. The term \"Second Order\" refers to the fact that this vibration occurs two times per revolution of the crankshaft.   What's worse, in an i4 these vibrations are perfectly in phase with each other with all 4 cylinders.  The fewest number of cylinders you can have and still have good secondary balance is 6.  I6 engines are inherently very well balanced. This is why many large heavily turbocharged diesel engines use this configuration.   At higher engine speed second-order forces grow in relation to the *square* of the crankshaft RPM, rather than in a linear fashion. This means that if you double the RPM the secondary vibration grows by 4x, and if you triple the RPM the vibration grows by 9x. So it's easy to see that this could lead to catastrophic engine failure to the tune of throwing a connecting rod in an i4.  To counteract this ~~almost all~~ (EDIT: *the majority of*) i4 engines have balancing shafts with counterweights that rotate at twice the engine RPM to prevent the engine from shaking itself off the engine mounts above, say, 2500RPM. Indeed most engines with less than 6 cylinders have balancing shafts of some type. This is far from a perfect solution with i4's since this still produces additional forces on the engine block between the crankshaft and balancer bearings that are less than desirable. The balancer shafts consume power themselves and result in higher vibration at idle speed. Their inertia reduces engine revving.   This brings us to the other prescription for the secondary balance problem, which is to reduce the engine redline. It's hard to get around this second part.   So, above 2.8L or so, you end up with a  Law-of -Diminishing-Returns relationship where larger and larger cylinders necessitate heavier connecting rods that cause greater and greater secondary vibration. This means you need to reduce the engine operating speed while using an increasingly heavy balancing shaft that consumes more power, causes more idle vibration, and induces more forces into the engine block between it's own bearings and the crankshaft main bearing. Thus, necessitating a thicker, heavier crankshaft and engine block. Beyond a certain point the fact that you're invariably forced to reduce the redline and increase engine weight in a way that's disproportionate to the displacement, wipes out any additional power you'd gain by increasing the cylinder size. Say, above about 3.5L  A V-8 deals with the secondary balance problem by operating each bank 90\u00b0 out of phase to each other, so that second-order forces in each bank tend to cancel each other instead of adding together constructively. However V-8s often use balancer shafts to counteract high RPM vibrations. The same can be much smaller on V-8 with respect to displacement, a V-8 with 6L does not need a balance shaft twice as large as an i4 with 3L. In fact a smaller one can be used in the former V8.  In V-6 engines there is good second order balance, but you have a moderate issue with primary balance.  A three cylinder engine does not have the outstanding primary balance of an i4, but it is better than a single cylinder. Specifically, in an i3 the uo and down monitions of the pistons to not always perfectly counteract each other. In a V6, unbalanced primary forces can be made to counteract each other best using a 60\u00b0 angle, but this does not entirely eliminate them. So V-6s have primary balance that is not quite a good as V-8's and they vibrate more. Again the usual solution is to reduce the redline RPM. Balancer shafts are also common on v6's  Another solution to the secondary balance problem is the one used by Karl Frederich Benz. He and his company produced the first flat-four opposed piston engine in 1900, using a boxer configuration that should ne familiar to fans of subaru, Porche, or VW cars.   These engines were used in Benz's racing cars, they had 5.4 liters and produced 20 HP, which was excellent at the time. The engines did not need balancer shafts at all and operated much more smoothly than the engines of Benz's competitors.  So why aren't flat-four boxer engines used on most cars? Well because they're significantly more difficult to produce and precision-assemble, and create a number of other less than obvious technical problems.",

    "question": "eli5:How does sugar contribute to developing diabetes?",
    "answer": "Until someone comes with more energy to get into detail, real brief & pre-k:  Sugar (glucose is the simplest form, and the most rapidly absorbed)* hitting your bloodstream causes insulin release, a hormone made by your pancreas.  Insulin acts as the key to help glucose get into cells (they need it for energy, extra is stored for later).  If a lot of glucose hits your blood suddenly, a lot of insulin has to be released too.  But if insulin keeps pestering the cells too much, they eventually get insensitive to it, and they need more insulin to open the same amount of doors.  So whereas, before, say you needed 10 insulin for 10 glucose (made up #s) now you need 100 insulin for 10 glucose and so on, it worsens.  Your pancreas too keeps having to put out more insulin, eventually it tires out.  So at some point your cells just aren\u2019t responding to the amount of insulin you produce, there\u2019s not enough insulin to remove all that glucose from your blood, and you\u2019ve got high blood glucose (which damages organs/tissues).  You\u2019ll need drugs either to help your pancreas release/produce more insulin, or straight up need insulin injections.  *Simple sugars are bad bc they\u2019re already glucose/almost glucose.  So 50g of skittles hit your blood as glucose faster than 50g of a more complex carb which will take longer to get broken down to glucose and will thus give your pancreas more time to trickle out insulin, and your cells more time to welcome a trickle of insulin rather than a sudden onslaught, making them less likely to get intolerant.  You\u2019ll also have less glucose floating freely in your blood, causing mischief.  *Edit:* Also yeah, as someone else correctly mentioned, it\u2019s excess body fat that more directly causes diabetes to develop; you can be long-term overweight and get diabetes without having eaten a single simple sugar food in your life (although glucose still gets formed by the breakdown of your meals).  My reply\u2019s really just focused on sugar re: diabetes.  Further mistakes/omissions in my insulin resistance mechanism explanation, but eh, come PhD this if you have the energy.

    "answer": "The general concept is that you change the content of your web page so that search engines will more often find that page when people search for relevant terms. You could also make sure relevant web pages link to your page as well. The simplest way to do SEO is to make sure the web page does mention any relevant search terms even though the content might not specify everything explicitly. So get out your synonim dictionary and get to work. You do not have to mention these terms directly in the content. You can add them all as a cluster on the end and make them invisible or almost invisible. You may notice web pages often have a bunch of different keywords at the end linking to pages showing other articles with the same keywords. The search engines will look at those as if they were actual useful links. In addition there is a hidden metadata field in the HTML header which is explicitly for search engine optimization and allows you to put a bunch of relevant search terms in there to help out the search engines point people to your site.  In general SEO is a big and complex industry. It is often a war between the search engines trying to give their users relevant content and the SEO companies trying to promote their content. The exact technique used by the search engiens to prioritize content is therefore secret but with some experimentation you might be able to figure out some of it.",

The FDA requires all medications to have an expiration date of no later than two years after the date of manufacture, regardless of how long the medicine actually stays good.  Many medications stay effective long after that, its mostly just a matter of trying it and seeing if it still works.  You just don't want to take more than whatever the normal dose is, even if it seems less effective, since some medications have a very low margin of safety and so taking 3 pills that are 75% effective as opposed to 2 that are 100% might put you over that, for example.  The FDA requires expired medications to be safe if you are taking no more than the maximum dose of them.  IE, if a medication says to take 2 pills it will *always* be safe to take 2 pills regardless of how expired the medication is.  Again, the worst thing that happens is it just does nothing.

    "answer": "A subject I have personal experience with!   I broke my humerus playing roller derby a few years back and the fracture severed my radial nerve, meaning I lost the ability to lift my wrist and extend my fingers.   As other posters have noted your nerves are protected by a myelin sheath, which is basically a tube around the actual nerve. If you think about your cell phone charging cable the nerve is like the metal wire inside that carries the electrical current and the myelin sheath is like the materials covering and insulating it.  When a nerve is damaged the entire portion of the nerve from the point of damage to the termination (or \u201cend\u201d) dies as well. As long as the myelin sheath remains intact or heals properly the nerve will begin to regrow from the point of damage to the termination point.   So when performing a transplant or reconstructive surgery all the surgeons can do is connect these tubes and wait for the nerve to regenerate within.   Nerves grow very slowly, about 1 inch per month. The radial nerve which I severed in my accident invenerates the hand muscles at the top of your forearm. There was approximately six inches between this point and the damage site so it took about six months to fully regain control of my hand functions.   As far as I know this only applies to nerves branching off the spinal column. The spinal nerve itself will not regenerate or heal itself in most circumstances, which is why spinal injuries usually result in permanent disabilities.   But long story short, we can\u2019t directly correct the nervous system through surgery or other intervention, we can only manipulate the tubes in which the nerves reside and wait for the nerves to repair themselves.",

This is true down to a pretty decent depth, so you can use it as a good approximation for all but the deepest mines and most enormous cave systems.

We form more specific details of what we find attractive by what culture tells us is attractive. Of course Freud is famous for his idea that everyone wants to fuck their own mothers. That was incorrect, but it touches on the correct idea that different cultures find different things attractive. For example, some but not all cultures find pale skin a sign of beauty, which isn't grounded in biology. A particular difference is noted in the difference between male beauty standards across the world. Europe and America tends to like big strong somewhat rugged men, but East Asia tends to prefer their men be boyish and pretty in a way we in the west might normally associate with women - cute, almost.

    "answer": "Iodine is an antiseptic and kills bacteria and viruses. It will have no effect on most chemical contaminants in water, and doesn\u2019t remove anything from the water. It just makes it so germs in the water die before you drink it. Interestingly, exactly why it does this is poorly understood, though it is known that iodine attacks a lot of the chemical compounds that germs need to function.  Iodine does not build up in your body, at least not long term. In fact, iodine is the heaviest element that your body has a use for and you need (very small) amounts of it to live. So some small amount will be incorporated, at least for a bit, into your body and that\u2019s a good thing!

Drinking a few drops might cause some burns before it dilutes down. I don\u2019t recommend it.  There exist radioactive isotopes of iodine (and all other elements), but they are not found in nature. Nuclear weapons and accidents can release a lot of these radioactive forms of iodine, though.

    "answer": "This phenomenon varies between different food types. Put simply, as you chew, your saliva dissolves the food in your mouth to help you swallow it. The first thing your saliva touches is the outer layer of your food. In the case of prepared meals like steak and pasta, the main flavor is on the outermost layer of your food, as you chew and swallow the saliva in your mouth it takes the flavors (herbs, spices, salt, seared crust etc.) down with it and you taste more of the remaining meat or wheat in these examples, which don't taste as flavorful without that outer seasoning. This is also why if you don't like the flavor of broccoli or peas, they taste worse the more you chew them, since the seasoning washes down with your saliva and the vegetable taste starts coming out.  You'll notice that this doesn't happen with fruits, ice cream, or chocolate etc. since in those cases all layers of what you're eating have the same flavor.",

Water purification is a lot more complex than water access is. A purification plant will necessary generate waste (whatever contaminant that needs to be removed).

You'd take the DNA for YFG and add a tiny extra string of 9 amino acids on the end. This particular string, YPYDVPDYA, is called the HA-tag. So you take your YFG-HA gene, put it into a vector for expression, and put that vector into cells.  Your gene gets transcribed and translated by the cells that have your vector, and they make a whole bunch of YFG-HA protein.  Now, how to purify it?  First, you burst all your cells with soap and shred them apart into a uniform protein soup.  Then, you take an antibody against the HA tag which binds it tightly, and you stick a coating of that antibody to tiny sand-sized plastic beads. You put those beads into a column, and run your protein soup through it. Your YFG-HA protein sticks to the antibodies on the beads while everything else runs through.  You put a few rinses of fluid through the plastic sand to really clean up those YFG-HA proteins trapped in there, then you run a different liquid through that breaks the antibody's bond to the HA tag, and you flush out a clean and pure solution of YFG-HA protein.",

    "question": "ELI5: How does an EMP work?",
    "answer": "When a nuclear weapon goes off it releases a huge amount of UV/Xrays/Gamma rays which move outward and smack into electrons of air molecules with enough energy to knock them loose and send the electrons flying.  This huge and sudden current of electrons quickly moving away from the center point creates a suddenly changing magnetic field.  We use this feature in transformers and wireless chargers.  If you change a current it creates a changing magnetic field which can be coupled into a nearby wire to create a current in that wire so you can pass power wirelessly.  For nuclear EMPs \"nearby\" is hundreds of miles away and the changing magnetic field is insanely strong.  The US did a test called [Starfish Prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_Prime) where they detonated a nuke about 400 km up(roughly the height of the space station which didn't exist yet).     Starfish Prime ended up creating a field over Hawaii (900 miles away) that was 5600 Volts/meter which means a 10 meter long power line would generate 56,000 volts at the end of it.  This is pretty bad for power lines and blew out a few hundred streetlights, but it was really before the era of microelectronics.  A 5mm long trace in your smart phone would have experienced 28 volts which is pretty devastating to a system expecting to run at less than 5 volts.

    "answer": "The mathematical constant e is referred to as representing natural growth. Unlike other popular constants like pi, e does not have a handy visual to explain it. Instead it can be thought of using banks and interest: (For true ELI5, interest means \"the bank will add 'this much' to your money at the specified time)  If we have a bank that generously offers 100% interest every year, and you give them $1, then after a year you will have $2.  But wait! A rival bank wants to offer 50% interest TWICE a year if you bank with them. At first, you may think that 50% twice = 100% once, but that isn't the case. After 6 months with this bank, your total + interest will be $1.50. Then another 6 months later it would be $2.25, getting $0.75 from 50% of the $1.50.  So it would seem that even if the % interest adds to the same 100%, getting it more often leads to giving you more money! So what about a bank that offers 25% interest every 3 months? Or 8.3% every month? How about an inconceivablely small percentage interest at every fraction of a millisecond throughout the year?  You'll find that the final amount tends toward the value of e if you were able to gain interest at a \"natural\" rate of growth.  100% once a year: $2  50% twice a year: $2.25  25% four times a year: $2.4414  8.3% twelve times a year: $2.613035  Every possible moment in a year: $2.71828 (approaching the value of e)  e is also important in Calculus and the natural log, but those are waaaay beyond a 5 year old.",

    "question": "ELI5: what do Galois groups actually prove about solvability?",
    "answer": "It is a bit complicated but let me try. First, there's two notions called \"solvability,\" one for polynomials and one for groups (I'll explain what groups are later). They'll turn out to be very intimately related, although it may not look like it from the get go. First let me explain the polynomial side of things, it might be a bit easier to grasp.  Ok, so start with a field (we usually take Q, so if you're not sure what the general definition of a field is, just picture rational numbers). You can ask yourself \"what's the smallest set containing Q and some real number that isn't in Q which has a coherent addition and multiplication such that all the \"nice\" properties hold (distributivity, commutativity, associativity, additive and multiplicative inverses)? For example, what's the smallest \"nice\" set (field) containing Q and sqrt(2)? Well, it turns out the best you can do is take all of Q and add all rational multiples of sqrt(2), so you end up with a set consisting of all rational numbers, all rational multiples of sqrt(2), and all possible sums of those. So, \u00bd is an element. So is 3/4xsqrt(2), and so is 4/435435+ 32/9sqrt(2). More generally, any element can be written as a+bsqrt(2), for a and b rational numbers. That set is written Q\\[sqrt(2)\\] (Q adjoin root 2).   Now, I may want to solve a polynomial like x\\^2 -2. The roots as you know are sqrt 2 and - sqrt 2, so they aren't rational. The smallest extension of the rational numbers in which I can find every single root is (in this case) Q\\[sqrt(2)\\]. That means that if I wanted to write that polynomial in factored form, the smallest place I could do it is in Q\\[sqrt(2)\\]. We say that this polynomial is \"solvable\" because I can write it in factored form in some extension of Q which I get to by adding roots. (There's nothing special about only adjoining root 2. I could adjoin any nth root of any rational number, and I could do that as many times as I want. So, something like Q\\[sqrt(2), cube root(1252), sqrt(34564)\\] is also a radical extension, and a polynomial which splits into linear factors in that extension would also be solvable).   Now let's turn to group theory. A group is just a set of symmetries of something -- it's all the ways you can reorder a thing and preserve it in some way. For example, the set of reorderings of the numbers (1,2) is a group containing the elements \"do nothing\" and \"switch 1 and 2.\" Certain groups have a property called \"solvability\" which is technical and seemingly unmotivated. Let's treat it as a black box.   Now, Galois theory relates extensions like Q\\[sqrt 2\\] to groups in a very precise way. For each extension, you can find a unique polynomial which factors linearly over that extension \\*and\\* when you combine all the factors, you get a polynomial with coefficients in Q \\*and\\* is as small (low degree) as possible. In the Q\\[sqrt 2\\] example, that polynomial is x\\^2-2 and it's called the minimal polynomial. The Galois group of the extension is the group which swaps all the roots of the minimal polynomial between each other (in a coherent way). For Q\\[sqrt 2\\], the Galois group is the group which can do 2 things: nothing, or swap sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2), and leave everything else the same. What that means is that the group \"acts\" on the extension. Say I take the group element g which swaps the roots. Then I can apply that element to a random element a + b sqrt(2) of Q\\[sqrt 2\\]. Then g(a+bsqrt(2)) = a-b sqrt(2), because I switch the roots and leave everything else the same.   If that group has the \"solvable\" property, then that polynomial is \"solvable\". Ie, I can write all of its roots in some extension of Q that I get to only by adding some nth roots. The same thing works in reverse: If I can solve a polynomial only by adding nth roots, then the galois group of that extension is solvable. If one of those conditions fails, then the other one must fail as well.   What Galois showed is that every possible group associated to a field where the degree of the minimal polynomial is less than 5 is solvable, but that some groups bigger than that are not solvable. So that implies that every polynomial of degree < 5 is such that every solution is a radical expression, but not every polynomial of degree >= 5 satisfies that.",

If both the token and the application that want authorization do the same calculations using that same initial condition, then at any time in the future, they can get the same answer and compare it. This means they know that they were the ones that synced earlier.  If the timekeeping on either device is out of sync, then when you say that the code right now should be \"ABCXYZ\", the other end might think \"No, right now it's supposed to be 'QWERTY'\". Being out of sync means that the trust is gone.  Depending on the system, you put some tolerances in it (i.e., you allow the token to be from N-1 to N+1 iterations out of sync), but that's mostly for user experience purposes. If you're truly getting out of sync, then odds are you will eventually hit N-2 or N+2 and be completely out of sync.  As for how, it depends on the system. If it's something like a Google Authenticator One Time Password system, if the time is *currently* incorrect on either device, then they won't get the right answer. With something like an actual RSA keyfob, those have their own clocks in them. If that clock is ever inaccurate, then it can gain or lose time.

A knot was literally measured using a long rope with uniformly spaced knots tied in it - when a ship wanted to measure its speed over water, it would toss one end of a rope over its stern that had a plank tied to the end of it.

For example, the speed of the wave on a coffee cup in a car's cup holder is the speed of the wave in the coffe, plus the speed of the coffee itself (which is moving at the speed of the car)   However, when it comes to electromagnetism, it appeared that there was no equation that told us the speed of the thing that light was travelling in. In Maxwell's equations, the vacuum speed of light just always equal to c.  This means that regardless of the source, whether it a lamp, or a moving car, or the Sun, or a spaceship flying towards me, I will always measure the speed of light from any of these sources to be c.  Turning that around, it also means that if I ever try to accelerate myself even faster, I will still _always_ measure the speed of my headlights to be c, which is why you can never accelerate faster than the speed of light.

I'm sure other redditors will go into greater detail but your controls are far more complex and if you are relying on the auto pilot you need to understand how to read and program that specific autopilot exactly. You can't learn to fly a Boeing 737-400 and then go fly a Boeing 737-800 - you'd have to go specifically retrain (Boeing 737NG course).  Navigation: In a car you are driving on a road with road markings and road signs and nowadays with extremely an useful GPS lady to guide you along. A huge part of flying is navigating as there's no signs up in the air to guide you along. And with weather conditions you have to learn to navigate by instrumentation alone.  Radio: This is the reason I could never be a pilot - I do not understand what is being said over the radio and you cannot fly safely without having proper communication and radio discipline. You have to be listening closely at **all** times because there's no way to fly safely without listening out for air traffic control constantly.  Safety: If your aircraft experiences any problem in air you can't simple pull over and open the hood. Therefore every single of aspect of flying involves safety checks and doublechecks.

    "answer": "Iodine is an antiseptic and kills bacteria and viruses. It will have no effect on most chemical contaminants in water, and doesn\u2019t remove anything from the water. It just makes it so germs in the water die before you drink it. Interestingly, exactly why it does this is poorly understood, though it is known that iodine attacks a lot of the chemical compounds that germs need to function.  Iodine does not build up in your body, at least not long term. In fact, iodine is the heaviest element that your body has a use for and you need (very small) amounts of it to live. So some small amount will be incorporated, at least for a bit, into your body and that\u2019s a good thing! If you don\u2019t get enough, you can even get [a disease called \u201ciodine deficiency\u201d](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_deficiency). Most people in the developed world get enough iodine in their diets to prevent this, and iodine is often added to table salt (because that\u2019s a convenient way to keep it) to ensure this.   Drinking a few drops might cause some burns before it dilutes down. I don\u2019t recommend it.  There exist radioactive isotopes of iodine (and all other elements), but they are not found in nature. Nuclear weapons and accidents can release a lot of these radioactive forms of iodine, though. To help prevent the body from taking up this radioactive iodine and using it, it is normal practice to give people who may be exposed to such a thing a fairly large doses of non-radioactive iodine to outcompete the dangerous, radioactive versions of it in your body.",

If we take WW2 as an example the French surrendered to the Germans after taking very little casualties compared to how large their military was.  The Germans out outmaneuvered the French and got behind them and at this point the French knew that they could either pull back and let even more German troops invade France or stay put and hold those troops off but let the Germans who had got past them run all over France.  Realising that all they had left were bad choices they surrendered.  Germany got what they wanted which was getting the French out of the war and having a rather large say in what France now did.  On paper the French should have won.  They had the more powerful military.  A state of war exists when a country declares war on another.  This is where you say that your military may engage the military of the other country and may invade their territory.  An actual war though starts when a military goes on the offensive.  This can take place with or without a declaration of war.",

They cannot see what's on your screen, unless they put a special tracking app on your phone.  They cannot see which apps you are using, unless - again - they put a special tracking app on your phone.  Apps access the internet in a similar way to browsers. So, if you log in to your bank app, they can only see that you connected to [https://myawesomebank.com](https://myawesomebank.com).  # Explanations  When you tell your browser to show [https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), it first needs to know what server hosts [youtube.com](https://youtube.com). So, it asks a special DNS server \"hey, what's [youtube.com](https://youtube.com)?\" And it'll respond \"It's 172.217.13.238!\" (I assume you know what an IP address is, but if not, it's basically like a home address - where a website lives in the internet.)  This is quite an old process, and in most circumstances is still done without any encryption - which basically means the employer can take a peek at it.  All other messages are sent encrypted (with HTTPS). This is that padlock icon in your browser, and it means that before sending anything, the browser and the server agreed to use a secret code so that noone else can read these messages.  However, some browsers (like Firefox (by the way you should totally switch to it it's really good)) can use DNS-over-HTTPS, which is the same encrypted connection to the DNS server. It's not the same level of security as using a VPN though, as they can still see that you're connecting to [172.217.13.238](https://172.217.13.238) and then do a reverse DNS lookup - that tells them you connected to some Google server, which could be anything.

Not too much water  or it\u2019s a weak drink (diarrhoea) or when there\u2019s too much cordial than it\u2019s super strong (constipation and hard stool)  Essentially the intestines will remove or add water to match the desired concentration it wants (a Bristol 3-4 poop)  But sometimes there are issues with the intestines walls which cause it too have extra cordial syrup (in this case it can be due to not being able to process certain foods, damage to the wall causing stuff to flow into the intestines, and viral/bacterial infections which cause the intestines to secrete more electrolytes)  There are 3 types of diarrhoea.  1. Secretory - your body secretes electrolytes into the lumen (open space in intestines).  2. Osmotic - your body lacks enzymes to absorb certain foods so these foods (like lactose) ends up causing water to be pulled into the intestines making it watery. 3.

    "answer": "The other answers talking about your pupils are incorrect, or at least not fully correct. It's true that the pupil changes size to let different amounts of light it, but that just takes a few seconds.   The process of eyes adjusting to the dark has to do with a chemical in the cells of your retina. Your retina (the part of your eye that senses light and sends the signals to your brain) is made up of two types of cells, rods and cones. Cones see in color but don't work if there's not enough light. Rods only see light and dark, but they can sense very small amounts of light.   In the rod cells there's a chemical called rhodopsin that's responsible for absorbing light and turning that into a signal to send to your brain, When a molecule of rhodopsin absorbs light, it breaks apart. When it's very bright out, all of the rhodopsin molecules are being broken apart by all the light. If you suddenly move into the dark, you don't have any rhodopsin left, so the rod cells can't absorb the light. It takes about 30 minutes for the rhodopsin molecules to \"regenerate\" so that the rod cells can absorb fully light again.",

Since the idea behind capitalism is the constant attempt to acquire more capital, that capital can be used to gain more capital exponentially, and keep others from gaining capital or taking your capital more easily, you end up getting a \"rich get richer\" snowball that pretty much kills competition.

Industrial salt aka road de-icing salt is very good at its main job of melting water or making brine ( used for things like oil drilling), but poisonous to eat even in small amounts.   Ice cream salt is salt for kitchen use to make ice cream, but is not food grade to eat because it could contain sand sized impurities.  Use it to make homemade ice cream, that's all it's good for.  Curing / Pickling salts are more \"food grade,\" and can be used for curing and pickling, but sometimes they include less safe Sodium Nitrite and Sodium Nitrate.  Those are not quite edible or palatable directly, but they make it possible for deli meats and bacon to exist.  Then you have your food grade salts which are virtually all Sodium Chloride, and wildly diverse by grain size and source, everything from table and kosher salts to Fleur le Sel to Himalayan.

You're not pulling on the tether ball or hitting it with a bat to give it some more energy, you're putting it on the barrel of a battleship gun and shooting it point blank.  The gamma ray hits the electron and it has sooooo much energy that it overwhelms any pull to the atomic nuclei and it just goes flying off away from the nuclei  You can pull it off with wayyy lower energy levels too.  Ionizing radiation (generally UV-C through Xrays to Gamma rays) all have enough energy that when they hit an electron they can give it enough energy to break free from its nuclei and go flying off.

Humans can actually do this with vitamin D, we produce vitamin D by standing in sunlight. Which is also believed to be part of the reason for the lighter skin tone of Caucasians. Europeans likely evolved that way during the last ice age to absorb more sunlight due to the lack of vitamin D in our diet while people of African decent kept a darker skin tone to ward off sunburn and skin cancer in the lower and sunnier latitudes.  The trade off for animals like cows and deer is that while grasses are very easy to find and consume, eating grass doesn't give you nearly as much energy as eating meat.

This huge and sudden current of electrons quickly moving away from the center point creates a suddenly changing magnetic field.  We use this feature in transformers and wireless chargers.  If you change a current it creates a changing magnetic field which can be coupled into a nearby wire to create a current in that wire so you can pass power wirelessly.  For nuclear EMPs \"nearby\" is hundreds of miles away and the changing magnetic field is insanely strong.  The US did a test called [Starfish Prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_Prime) where they detonated a nuke about 400 km up(roughly the height of the space station which didn't exist yet).     Starfish Prime ended up creating a field over Hawaii (900 miles away) that was 5600 Volts/meter which means a 10 meter long power line would generate 56,000 volts at the end of it.  This is pretty bad for power lines and blew out a few hundred streetlights, but it was really before the era of microelectronics.

The lateral flow devices (LFDs) that we used in the self-test antibody study detected antibodies to the spike protein so we were unable to tell if the antibodies were due to infection or to the vaccine (which is why you have been asked to provide this blood sample).   The laboratory test being used in this follow-up study detects antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein which are only produced following infection, so a positive test result will tell us that you have previously been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.",

    "question": "ELI5 --- Why is it called \"price-elastic demand\" when consumers are sensitive to changes in price, and \"price-inelastic demand\" when they're not? Doesn't \"elastic\" imply that the price is flexible and that consumers wouldn't mind small changes in price, while inelastic its not flexible?",
    "answer": "So price elastic demand means that as the price changes demand will change. The elastic (changing) price affects demand. This works for things such as phones and luxury services. If the price goes up people will be less likely to buy them.   Price inelastic demand means that the price changing will not affect the demand. This largely applies to necessities such as gas or food. People will buy these things at any price because they have to buy them.",

    "question": "ELI5: What is the relationship between the sampling rate of my audio stream and the frequency response of my headphones?",
    "answer": "the frequency response of a speaker is inherent to the speaker itself. It just means the drivers in the headphones will be able to produce frequencies between 15 and 28kHz, and doesn't have anything to do with the sample rate of the audio from your computer.  The sample rate and bit depth of an audio signal will dictate how perfectly the digital waveform will match the analog one. Say for example, you have a pure sine wave running into a recording interface. This gets converted by an ADC into a digital version. If your sample rate is really bad, it will end up looking like a square wave, or a kind of stepped triangle wave. If its good, it will be really close to a sine wave. Then digital filters can be used to smooth all the sharp edges and make it a nice round wave again.  The sample rate being 2x your sound frequency is the nyquist theorem. It has nothing to do with doubling the frequencies you are hearing or playing back within the audio itself; what it means is if you are only interested in the audio range (up to \\~20kHz), you need at least a 40kHz sample rate to not get any aliasing or artifacts. It's 2x the highest frequency you care about.",

    "answer": "Inequity is not a new problem, and it's not something that's suddenly started getting much worse.  While people like to compare Jeff Bezos' fortune to the average Amazon worker's salary and say \"inequality as never before\", that's not true.  It you compare the wealth of a 16th century french king to a 16th century peasant, the inequality was much worse in the 16th century.  Since the era of the pyramids (5000 years ago) it's been important for the people on the \"got a lot\" side of inequality to offer some justification for why they have so much more than everybody else.  Religion was invented for this purpose.  Kings were \"God on Earth\", or had \"Divine Right to Rule\".  The purpose of churches was to make the \"not got a lot\" people happy with the situation, and they often did that by promising them a better life in the future (aka after they died).  Religion has done its job for those thousands of years, so it's kept around.  While 25% of people in the US have no chosen religion, and that number is rising, everybody running for President is in favor of a religion.

Secretory - your body secretes electrolytes into the lumen (open space in intestines).  2.

    "answer": "There is a point about national debt that helped me understand it better: the debt cannot be recalled whenever the borrower wants. The bonds the government uses to borrow money have fixed terms and interest rates, so all payments are incredibly predictable. The government always knows exactly how much it needs to pay in a given month or year.  It also knows how much it might owe in a given month or year if it takes on 2 trillion dollars in additional  debt to fund covid stimulus or infrastructure.    As long as these predictable payments don't make up a large portion of the budget, it really doesn't matter how big the actual total debt number is.    Problems occurr when a country cannot keep up with it's payments.  At that point, the only option is to print the money, which causes high inflation. Then nobody wants to borrow money from that country anymore, so they have a hard time serving their people after that.  Currently, the US spends about 6% of it's budget on servicing it's debt.

    "question": "ELI5: why do we still use asphalt for roads if it's harming the environment?",
    "answer": "The problem might not be as big as you have been made to beleave. The amount of area covered in asphalt is negligable compared to the total area of the Earth. Even other human land uses such as roofs is a bigger issue. And things like planting trees contribute far more to global warming due to darkening of areas then a few asphalt roads do.  In addition asphalt tends to be dark only when freshly laid. After some use the dark binder on the top wear off leaving only the agregate visible which tends to be of a lighter local stone. It have even been common for workers to put down a layer of pure agregate as a top layer when laying asphalt in order to both save costs and reduce environmental impact. This produces a lighter color rougher surface like if the asphalt was already worn. Local businesses does also ask to use lighter rocks for agregate if heat is an issue when laying asphalt for parking spaces and sidewalks.  Paint would be one of the worst thing to do. Firstly the reason we use asphalt is because of its high friction which is required to allow cars to go at high speeds without sliding out of control. Paint have much lower friction and can therefore only be used sparingly. This is why you should avoid driving on the road markings. Secondly paint is far less durable then asphalt. Dust from asphalt is already a huge issue in cities and adding a lot of plastic dust from the paint wearing off is not the best way to solve the issue of global warming.  Of course the best option of all is if we can all stop driving cars and instead use public transport.

    "answer": "Ever played Pandemic? The way you win Pandemic is to be *highly* infectious but very low lethality. Then, once the entire world is infected, you buy heart failure.   Reality doesn't work like that - the same mutation doesn't arise simultaneously in all instances of the virus - but the important part, that high infectivity, low lethality viruses are S tier, is true. High infectivity and low lethality allows the virus to propagate and multiply. The more people are infected, the more copies of the virus there are. The more copies of the virus there are, the more opportunities the virus has to develop new mutations.   Omicron will already have mutated a bunch of times. Most of those mutations won't change anything. Some of them will make it less effective. Some of them will make it more infective. Some of them will make it more deadly, meaning it's both high infectivity and high lethality. When that happens (and it is a when, not an if), it'll become the next major variant and it could potentially be worse than the first wave. Basically, the fewer people infected, the less likely new mutations are to emerge. A strain that can infect a lot of people is bad because of the future mutation potential.  There's also a matter of simple maths. Imagine that Delta Covid infects 10,000 people per day and hospitalises 1% of infected. That's 100 new admissions to hospitals per day. Now imagine Omicron has half the hospitalisation rate of Delta, but has three times the infectivity. Omicron infects 30,000 people per day, and hospitalises 0.5% of them. That's 150 new admissions per day. That's worse overall even though Omicron is less lethal individually, because it's infecting so many more people.",

So it is often cheaper to load the cargo onto trucks so they can deliver the cargo all the way to the final destination rather then load it onto a train and carry it most of the way before having to reload it onto trucks for the last mile. Even the factories which have side tracks from the days of cheaper labor no longer use these as reloading the cargo onto a one or two car train for final delivery still costs too much.  However when enough cargo to fill a train is to be sent from one place to another then freight trains are still undisputed. Other places do have cargo collected in order to be sent on a freight train for longer distances as the reloading cost is lower then the cost of long distance trucks. A place like a big dock would be typical places where you could reload cargo between trucks, trains and ships. But the Netherlands is not big so most cargo within the country is likely going on trucks and then you have a few big cargo terminals mostly for international goods.",

Long, silky hair means no diseases that damage hair growth. Nice arse means the person isn't malnourished.   Then on top of that you get cultural beauty standards. We form more specific details of what we find attractive by what culture tells us is attractive. Of course Freud is famous for his idea that everyone wants to fuck their own mothers. That was incorrect, but it touches on the correct idea that different cultures find different things attractive. For example, some but not all cultures find pale skin a sign of beauty, which isn't grounded in biology. A particular difference is noted in the difference between male beauty standards across the world. Europe and America tends to like big strong somewhat rugged men, but East Asia tends to prefer their men be boyish and pretty in a way we in the west might normally associate with women - cute, almost.

    "question": "ELI5: If solar panels can be put on the roof of a house into a battery for electricity, why cant/dont car manufacturers like tesla put it on the top of cars to have unlimited range?",
    "answer": "That is basically an age-old battle between power generation and power consumption.  For solar energy you need space and sun. Lots of it actually, and while in some countries the weather pattern is enough for solar generation, in many countries solar energy on a private site like a normal house can only supply X percentage of your daily / yearly consumption. This is of course still a major benefit, hence more and more buildings incorporate some kind of regenerative system (even only to reduce normal energy costs by a few percent).  For cars however this is a bit problematic, as the space on a car roof is simply way too small to generate energy to generate enough energy efficiently enough to power batteries ... not even considering tunnels, bad weather, being in a garage or roofed parking lot, inside the shadows of skyscrapers in a city or a forest etc. You can optimize your solar energy generation at your home. You cannot do that nearly as good for a car.  Now in theory they can at least supply a bit of energy, but the next issue would be the price. For a building costing hundreds of thousands of EUR the price for a solar system is relatively low (compared to the building price). For a car, the relative price would be much higher, noticeably increasing the cars price ... and e-cars are trying to make their way in an extremely competitive environment, where even a few hundred EUR can already influence the purchase decision of a buyer.   Last but not least: cars are designed in their form and looks with specific goals in mind (good looks, areodynamics etc). Commercial solar panels cannot (yet) be brought into the form necessary for a seamless integration in the often curved roof or an engine hood. There are some developments where solar cells can be formed like plastics, but IIRC they are still a bit out of range of normal, large scale, commercial use.  In the end solar generation integrated into the hull of a vehicle will be coming, but only to supply some additional energy for onboard equipment like radios, lights etc.  SYL",

    "answer": "The GPU is the Graphics Processor (or Processing) Unit. It's a fancy (pricy) way to name what we used to call the Display Adapter, where you plug in your monitor. Presumably it has a processor in it and lots of memory, so arguably it's a whole computer, totally devoted to making the images you see on the screen.  It's very possible that the processor in the GPU is faster and has more memory than the CPU (Central Processor Unit) of the computer itself, as well as having more memory available to it. This is for high end graphics, including high resolution, 3D motion, game graphics. etc..  Back in the day, the Display Adapter simply sent out to the screen whatever was in the display memory area of the computer. It was put there by the CPU. In fact one inexpensive computer (Timex) used the back-scan part of the image generation to run actual computation. So you could speed up your program by selectively turning off the display. That's sort of the exact opposite of having a GPU. lol  Also, some folks use this power of the GPU to do other computation when it's not in use. For example, Bitcoin mining or BOINC computation.

An ISA can be thought of as a \"programming language\" specification for CPUs: it defines the interface for how you talk to the CPU and what you should expect out of it.  ARM is a reduced instruction set ([RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer)) architecture, while x86 is a complex instruction set ([CSIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer)) architecture. The ELI5 version of that is x86 has way more instructions in its language, and the shape and behavior of those instructions are far more complicated.  For example, x86 instructions are variable-length, meaning the instruction decoder needs to read each byte to determine how many more bytes to read next in order to decode the instruction.  The x86 ISA also has instructions that can manipulate memory directly, while in ARM, you would have to perform all operations on registers before storing those registers back to memory with an appropriate instruction. Technically it's an abstraction, since under the hood, the CPU may well be loading the memory location into a hidden register, performing the requested operation on it, and then store it back to memory, but to you it looks like one instruction.  TL;DR, you can think of them as different programming languages, where x86 has more language features, at the expense of complexity.",

Humans have larger brains than other apes and so our snouts are less pronounced than chimpanzees; a typical human skull was also maybe 8in long at the toothline, but closer to 7in at the eyeline.  I say \"was\" because the human jaw doesn't grow correctly unless children are given solid foods to chew.  The reliance on cereals (oatmeal, rice, flour, etc.) as a calorie source, and to a lesser extent the invention of baby food to prevent choking deaths, has resulted in almost everyone--at least in rich Western countries--having severely deformed faces.  (For example, I grew up in a middle-class family in the United States and so my forehead is directly above my teeth: my head is about 7in long at the eyeline--normal human size--but also 7in at the toothline.  98% of the people I meet are the same: flat-muzzled.

    "answer": "Similar, but not really the same.  Smelling something means that enough of it is reaching your olfactory center up in your nose to set off the nerves in there, which relay the smell to your brain.  Inhaling something usually implies that that something is reaching your lungs.  So you could inhale something through your nose and smell it.  But you could also inhale something through your mouth and not smell it.  For smell soemthing, it has enter your nose at a minimum. And if you are smelling it, chances are it also also probably being inhaled to your lungs, but that isn\u2019t 110% guaranteed.",

    "question": "ELI5: If 35mm film can be scanned up to 4K, does that mean I could have old film rolls from my cheap 1990s photo camera scanned to 4K?",
    "answer": "Depends on camera and film.  A cheap lens, small lens or high ISO film (much over ISO 100) will all result in degraded image vs what you\u2019d expect from a modern digital camera, similarly whether the scene is sufficiently in focus may also make scanning to 4K pointless.  When they use film to shoot movies they\u2019re using high quality lenses, a huge lens compared to your point-and-click camera and high quality film because the whole experience is intended to be projected onto a big screen.  The lens quality affects image quality, focus, distortions, etc.  A small lens impacts resolution, but it also affects the speed of film. If you have a huge lens you are gathering a ton of light so can get a better picture from a short exposure of a lower ISO film.  ISO - with film this was a trade off between light sensitivity vs quality. ISO 400 could be more easily used indoors with a regular camera, because it needed shorter exposure, but was grainier than ISO 100 because of how it achieved that sensitivity.",

Basically, in the first flat-ish part, the water that just hit the sink is going faster that a wave can travel in water. As the water slows down, the way it flows changes and that gives this distinct profile.

    "answer": "I can write the word \"cat\" with a crayon. But when my wife writes the word \"cat\" with her crayon, it looks completely different. Her handwriting is nicer than mine and my letters look squiggly and ugly compared to hers. Same letters, they just look different. You can make letters on a screen look different, too. That's called a \"font\". Just like different handwriting... same letters that just look a little different. A QR code is really just a weird font. It's handwriting that looks so funny that only a specialist can read it. (Your scanner is the specialist.)  Did you ever notice that QR codes always have three corners that look like plain boxes? That's how the computer knows which side is the top. If you look at a book that's upside down, you know to turn it over before you try to read it. Those boxes tell the computer which way to turn it before it tries to read it.  There's also something called \"error correction\" built in. If I put a dot here for the letter \"c\", then I also put a dot over there to represent that same \"c\". I don't need both dots; I can use either one. But that way, if part of my QR code gets scratched off or dirty, I have a better chance of reading the right message because the clean parts still have enough information.  And finally, there's something called a \"checksum\". A checksum is a small fact about what you just read. For example, I might say \"cat(3)\". That 3 at the end would mean that you should have read a 3-letter word. Or maybe I say \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.(23,12)\" and that means you should have read 23 consonants and 12 vowels. If what you read doesn't match the checksum, then you should try reading it again. A barcode scanner can actually read a barcode multiple times if it has to to get it right.  Quick note: There are many different types of barcodes: UPC, QR, Aztec, Code9. There's a different one on your mail. There's a different one on the sticker on the fruit you buy at the grocery store.

The second means the rings were always there, and are stable enough to last 4.5 billions years, implying they are going nowhere.

In the liver, alcohol, or more precisely *ethanol* is attacked by the enzyme *alcohol dehydrogenase* -- \"alcohol,\" referring to the type of chemical it attacks, \"dehydrogen-\" for what it does (literally pulling a hydrogen away from something), and the \"-ase\" ending denoting an enzyme.  So ethanol binds to the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, which pulls off the hydrogen at the end of the molecule, converting it into something called *acetaldehyde*, which is then kicked into the body and allowed to circulate.  It's that chemical, acetaldehyde, which is the other contributing cause of hangover. The body processes acetaldehyde in a similar way, over time, splitting it again into something the body can eliminate.",

    "question": "ELI5 \u201cHot Hands\u201d or other hand warmers - how do they work/ how are they safe?",
    "answer": "There are different types, but one uses sodium acetate dissolved in water. It's a super-saturated solution, meaning that really there is more stuff dissolved in the water than the water would \"like\". So the sodium acetates \"wants\" to start come out of solution and form solid crystals. To start growing a crystal, though, you need a *nucleation site*, some little bit of something that the first sodium acetate molecules can latch onto and then gather into a crystal from there. Without a nucleation site, the sodium acetate stays in its super-saturated solution.  The hand warmer packet contains this solution along with a little strip of metal. If you bend this strip, little bits of metal come off and these provide nucleation sites for the crystals to start growing. This crystallization process is an *exothermic*, i.e. heat-releasing, reaction.  How did the heat get there? Well, to create a super-saturated solution, you need to dissolve the sodium acetate in hot water (which can hold more stuff in solution) and then let it cool. Some of the heat you put in gets stored in the solution - the heat that was necessary to get it super-saturated (in other words, the solution reaction was *endothermic*). When the excess sodium acetate crystallizes, the heat energy stored in the solution is released.  As to why it is safe, you can calculate how much heat energy will be released and thus how  hot the hand warmer will get. So you can ensure that the temperature will be in a safe range. There's no danger of a \"runaway\" reaction since you know exactly how much sodium acetate you dissolved and how much solution you put in the packet.",

Alpha and beta are emissions of protons and helium nucleus. Gamma is an emission of very high energy light.   Radio waves are a form of very low energy light. Even though it is light like gamma it doesn\u2019t carry enough energy to knock electrons out of place (this is called Ionization) thus making it pretty much harmless. The spectrum of light goes from radio to microwave to infa red to visible to ultra violet to gamma. Only when you get to UV will the light have enough energy to do real damage.

Her husband handled picking up the printed copies and distributing free stacks to all the local Mom & Pop businesses.   20 years ago they had 2 part-time staff, one was an older woman who went to openings and events and filed stories.

    "answer": "Inflation is a \"market\" thing.  Prices aren't (usually) set by some entity. For something like an electronic component, the company that makes it decides what to sell it for. Companies that make things like TVs decide what to sell the TVs for. They want that price to be higher than the cost of the stuff they bought to make it. They also pay attention to what their competitors are charging and want their price to be below their competitors', unless they think they have a better offering.   If the company wants to make more money, or if they think the costs of making the TV are going to go up, they raise their price. If it's true the costs of their materials went up, it's likely their competitors' prices are going up too. If their competitors see their prices go up even when materials aren't going up, their competitors might raise their prices to match. Or, if the store that sells the TVs wants more money, they might raise the price they sell the TVs for so they make a little more profit.   The only way to truly stop inflation is for the government to set the price for *everything*, but that creates a lot of other economic problems. Instead, we prefer for the government to take indirect actions like changing the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the government. That changes how banks issue loans, which changes how people invest, which can tighten or loosen a lot of purse strings that ripple through the economy.",

    "answer": "The plankton and algae that die and become deposited on the ocean floor are the source of oil. When many layers of these dead ocean microorganisms pile up in layers, the layers compact on each other due to the weight. This is known as lithifaction. This can make thick layers of concentrated organic matter, especially as it gets buried deep below ground where heat and pressure break down organics into oil. (but not too deep, the earth gets hotter with depth, the oil turns to graphite/carbon if its too deep).  Oil is trapped underground by different types of rocks- Some allow water, oil, and gasses to move through it, like sandstones or shales (along the layers) while other rocks don't allow it to travel through it (perpendicular to the layers in shale), and mudstones. These are called permeable rocks vs impermeable rocks- and they are important in keeping the oil from diluting into other rock layers as something that can't be mined. You have different layers of ocean rock because of seasons and climates. Some seasons and climates favor plankton, others do not. Since over time these change, you have different rock layers.   This doesn't mean that the ocean rock is oil rich, the rock must concentrate the oil some to make it something that can be extracted generally. Oil will have water with it, and water helps dissolve the gasses and volatiles. You have geologic events that create folds in the ground (called anticlines, synclines, domes) that move the oil/gas to concentrated areas where liquid oil can be pumped out of.   &#x200B;  So, in short the plankton is concentrated in the rock, buried deeply with tons of pressure and heat, and then plate tectonics helps concentrate the oil in pockets.  -Geologist in training.",

If you're just floating around in your spaceship you'll be pushed backwards a bit, but not much differently than if you jumped up and fired on earth (ignoring the vertical movement).  As for the bullet, it too will behave like a bullet fired at sea level. No conventional firearm propels a bullet fast enough to achieve orbit or escape the earth's gravity well.

To see why it's important, let's say you're combining chloride and sodium to make salt. NaCl is one part sodium, and one part chlorine, but one gram of sodium plus one gram of chloride doesn't get you two grams of NaCl.   However, if you use moles, it works. One mole of sodium and one mole of chloride would react to give one mole of sodium chloride.  One mole of sodium weighs about 23 grams, and one mole of chloride weighs about 35.5 grams.",

When water is liquid, the molecules are all jumbled up while they're vibrating (imagine wildly shaking a box full of V-shaped puzzle pieces).  The molecules can't make any hydrogen bonds because the vibrating is too strong and they'll break apart.  When water starts to cool off, the molecules do get a little closer together, but there's still too much vibrating to let the hydrogen bonds form (imagine the puzzle pieces are gently shaking themselves into a smaller pile inside the box). But once it's cold enough, there isn't enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds apart.

Instead it can be thought of using banks and interest: (For true ELI5, interest means \"the bank will add 'this much' to your money at the specified time)  If we have a bank that generously offers 100% interest every year, and you give them $1, then after a year you will have $2.  But wait! A rival bank wants to offer 50% interest TWICE a year if you bank with them. At first, you may think that 50% twice = 100% once, but that isn't the case. After 6 months with this bank, your total + interest will be $1.50. Then another 6 months later it would be $2.25, getting $0.75 from 50% of the $1.50.  So it would seem that even if the % interest adds to the same 100%, getting it more often leads to giving you more money! So what about a bank that offers 25% interest every 3 months? Or 8.3% every month? How about an inconceivablely small percentage interest at every fraction of a millisecond throughout the year?  You'll find that the final amount tends toward the value of e if you were able to gain interest at a \"natural\" rate of growth.  100% once a year: $2  50% twice a year: $2.25  25% four times a year: $2.4414  8.3% twelve times a year: $2.613035  Every possible moment in a year: $2.71828 (approaching the value of e)  e is also important in Calculus and the natural log, but those are waaaay beyond a 5 year old.",

Mathematician Hannah Fry did a great documentary, Magic Numbers: Hannah Fry's Mysterious World of Maths, which devotes part of its time to the issue. It was in Amazon Prime Video as of a few months ago.  For my part, I think it's clear that quantities of things exist independently of our being around to count them, so at least the most fundamental elements of math are inherent to the universe. I don't think it would be possible to have anything approaching an understanding of the world without at least *some* math, so it is essential in that sense.   That said, the world exists, the universe was created in the Big Bang, galaxies and all other celestial bodies evolved, an atmosphere formed on some of them, and life flourishes in an enormous variety of forms all without anyone doing a single formula. Lifeforms from tons of species' live their entire existence without ever contemplating numbers or any real mathematical concepts. So, it's not in any way essential in *that* sense.  Ultimately it's a philosophical matter without any real answer.",

    "question": "eli5:How does iodine(polar pure) purify water?",
    "answer": "Iodine is an antiseptic and kills bacteria and viruses. It will have no effect on most chemical contaminants in water, and doesn\u2019t remove anything from the water. It just makes it so germs in the water die before you drink it. Interestingly, exactly why it does this is poorly understood, though it is known that iodine attacks a lot of the chemical compounds that germs need to function.  Iodine does not build up in your body, at least not long term. In fact, iodine is the heaviest element that your body has a use for and you need (very small) amounts of it to live. So some small amount will be incorporated, at least for a bit, into your body and that\u2019s a good thing! If you don\u2019t get enough, you can even get [a disease called \u201ciodine deficiency\u201d](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_deficiency). Most people in the developed world get enough iodine in their diets to prevent this, and iodine is often added to table salt (because that\u2019s a convenient way to keep it) to ensure this.   Drinking a few drops might cause some burns before it dilutes down. I don\u2019t recommend it.  There exist radioactive isotopes of iodine (and all other elements), but they are not found in nature. Nuclear weapons and accidents can release a lot of these radioactive forms of iodine, though. To help prevent the body from taking up this radioactive iodine and using it, it is normal practice to give people who may be exposed to such a thing a fairly large doses of non-radioactive iodine to outcompete the dangerous, radioactive versions of it in your body.",

    "answer": "Two things that make food go bad are oxygen and tiny little living things, we could call them germs.  For a new bottle of sauce that hasn't been opened, there's usually only a tiny bit of air at the top and it's not enough oxygen to make it taste bad.  The germs are usually killed by heating, or, less often, some other method, like radiation or high pressure.  So a bottle is sitting there with almost no oxygen and no living germs - it can last for a long time without going bad.   But as soon as you open the seal, you allow air in and air has oxygen and germs floating around, so the sauce might go bad in a few days. If you put it in the fridge, the cold makes the germs slow down a lot, so they don't eat up the sauce and they don't make new germs as fast.  There's still oxygen, but if you put the cap on, that will also slow down.",

This could be over the wires used for cable TV, over the phone wires or over a fiber optic cable. There are a few other connection method but they are the common ones. This connection goes to a box in your house called a router (sometimes also called a hub) this is normally supplied by the ISP.  The router is the centre of your houses network, anything using your houses internet connection will connect to this box either using a wired connection or WiFi.  WiFi is a short range radio link between two devices, normally a computer/ phone and a central hub device called an access point. Your router includes one of these access points or in some cases more than one e.g. one for your normal network and one for a guest network.  WiFi is purely a way of getting a computer network connection without a wire, it doesn't do anything that a physical wire between the two points couldn't do (and generally when possible a wire is better). WiFi doesn't give you a connection to the internet, it only gives you a connection to your local router/access point.

    "question": "ELI5: Why do \"red skies at morning\" mean it's going to storm later that day?",
    "answer": "It has to do with the scattering of incoming solar radiation. It is called Rayleigh scattering. the way weather systems travel is from west to east.   The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  Incoming solar radiation deflected sideways at an angle. If that angle is high then it brings about blue skies and such. If there is a blue sunrise that, to me, as a weather forecaster tells me I have low pressure to my east. The storm has passed.   As a result of low pressure being to my east, I will have high pressure to my west. High pressure is associated with good weather and great conditions. The high pressure is to come and move over my station.   High pressure brings about a low sun angle because it condenses the atmosphere. This low sun angle gives us our red sunrises and sunsets.  Edit: This is more of a mid latitude United States phenomenon. I decided to give it another shot\u2014 see below  Sun rises in the east and sets in the west.    Cool.   If at any point the sun rise or sun set is the color orange, red, or pink it can be inferred that the atmosphere is being condensed under the influence of high pressure. Because the sun is low in the sky and the atmosphere is condensed this is used to locate where high pressure is. Whether it is departing or arriving to you.   On the other hand, low pressure within the atmosphere allows it to expand. Therefore, wherever low pressure is located the sky at sun rise and sun set will not appear the colors aforementioned but will be your usual blue sky. This is due to the lack of condensation in the atmosphere. It allows the blue to be seen instead of the other colors on the visible spectrum.   In the mid latitudes (not the equator or the poles) between 60 degrees N and 30 degrees N there is the polar front jet (jet stream) that is high in the sky and it helps high pressure and low pressure move across mid latitudes in a west to east fashion as this is the only way the wind travels in the polar front jet. So this is the way low pressure systems (more commonly frontal boundaries) move with high pressure ahead and behind the fronts.   Weather is fluid and ever changing.

    "answer": "TV networks send their signal either up to a satellite (by far most common) or directly to the cable company via a fiber network (uncommon, for special cases)  If by satellite, there a ton of communications/tv satellites out there, they just rent space on it. They send the signal up to the satellite and the satellite bounces/broadcasts it back down. The cable company then has their own receivers on the ground that pick up the satellite signal for each channel  If its a fiber, they have a direct feed to the cable/sat company. This is more common for streaming live TV services (like Sling TV), for reasons beyond this ELI5, but satellite is overwhelmingly the most common way its done  Signals are all encoded in fairly complicated ways to make sure its high enough quality, but also not too bandwidth heavy. It will vary a little on each tv network. Usually the raw signal from the tv network is an overly high quality version.  The cable company when they send the customer the tv channel, transcodes everything to the proper format they need to send it to you, which again, will vary by each channel and cable provider, but its compressed and reduced. If you're wondering, top channels, like sports and HBO are the best quality, and they may send lower quality signals of channels that aren't watched much.

Many colleges/universities even require Freshmen to live on campus for the first year at least, so that drastically increases how much money a person actually spends \"on\" education.

    "answer": "It is a great question. The analogy of water flowing in a pipe, sort of breaks down once you get to the level of electrons and such.   1) Electrons are not massless particles. Therefore electrons cannot travel at the speed of light. The explanation is from Einstein: that anything with mass would need infinite energy to accelerate to the speed of light.   2) What is \"moving\" at the speed of light is the change in the electromagnetic field. The term used is propagate rather than move.   3) The speed of individual electrons cannot actually be measured with precision. But the presence of a voltage in wire will induce a \"general flow\" of electrons in one direction. (Imagine water in a turbulent river - we cannot say what speed any particular drop of water is moving but we can tell how fast the entire flow is moving in general) This flow speed is called \"drift velocity\" and is called drift because in most circumstances it is VERY slow.   4) Drift velocity direction depends on which side of the wire has higher voltage relative to the other. In power grids, the voltage is AC, so it swings from positive to negative. In effect the drift velocity switches each time the voltage switches signs and therefore the average drift velocity in the power grid is ZERO. That is, electrons aren't \"shooting out\" at one end of an electric cable.   So one can imagine electrons essentially moving backwards and forwards but not really going anywhere. This is just an illustration - electrons don't organize themselves like balls of stuff and their actual motion isn't like cars going down a road.",

What you're really asking is something like:  \"If COVID is spreading, how come the flu is not?\"  The first answer is that this year, due to COVID, people are more afraid of the flu than usual. So more people got flu vaccinations than usual. So the flu is at a disadvantage compared to COVID because people are already prepared for it.  The rest involves thinking about how a disease spreads and some fairly complicated science involving how infections spread. While we understand a lot about how most flu viruses spread, COVID is still relatively new and we haven't answered all of the questions for it yet.  These are the reasons I see a lot of articles choosing to answer this question, keeping in mind that there are a lot of different flu viruses and thus some don't follow these rules:  * Most people already have some flu antibodies, so if the flu viruses in the wild this season are similar to previous seasons, we're already at some percentage of natural immunity. * COVID is already infecting many people, where other flu viruses had to start from zero. COVID started infecting us before we were prepared for it, and now that we're trying to take precautions against COVID it's hard for a new virus to get a foothold. * We think COVID \"fits\" in smaller saliva particles and stays \"alive\" in them longer than many flu viruses. That makes it easier to catch COVID than a normal flu.  * We are testing, but haven't concluded, that you can get sick from inhaling fewer COVID virus particles than many other flu viruses. Think of this like people getting drunk: some kinds of liquor will make a person drunk from a shot or two, but people can drink pints of others. * COVID has an above-average time between when you are contagious and when you present symptoms when compared to other flu viruses. That means people sick with COVID find out later and can infect more people before they isolate.   All in all, the answer is just \"COVID is more contagious\" combined with \"it's already here\". We think if we put a contagious person next to 10 healthy people, the 10 healthy people are more likely to get COVID than the average flu virus. So if a mask has something like a 60% rate of protection, but the normal flu has a lower rate of infection to begin with, it follows that the mask is even better at preventing the normal flu than COVID.  The important thing to learn is: we could make EVERY flu season this way if we'd wear masks and try not to stay too close together in flu season.",

However you do not need anything to transfer thermal energy. Although not as efficient hot things will emit thermal radiation which will heat up objects around it. This is how the heat from the sun is transferred through empty space to Earth and how the heat from a fire can warm you even though the air goes up into the air. And we can measure how much energy comes from each direction and therefore get a temperature of everything. And it turns out the universe is pretty cold. But it will take a long time for someone to cool down to this temperature. Especially if they happen to be around Earth and get hit by the heat emitted from the Earth as well as the hot rays from the Sun.",

It's the kind of thing that you are going to loose customers over. And with them, income.  The incentive to offer a better quality service eventually outweighs the incentive to keep customers with old equipment happy. But the harsh reality is that most people buy a new TV once every ten-fifteen years or so and expect to keep it until it doesn't turn on any more.

Leaded solder (commonly 63% lead, 37% tin) will melt at 183C while Lead melts at 327C and Tin melts at 232C so that's a big drop.  You can tweak the melting point and some strength parameters by adjusting the mix but there are a few happy points.  A common lead free solder is SAC 305 which is 97% tin, 3% silver, and 0.5% copper, the mix of metals helps give it the right properties  The ideal mixture comes down to how everything interacts to form little metallic crystals  When you solder something its not like glue where there's material A, layer of glue, material B, there's actually an interface layer.  If you're soldering a copper wire to a gold pad there will be gold, layer of gold/tin/other solder bits that transition from pure gold to pure solder, then layer of solder, then tin/copper/solder mix as it bonds to the wire, then just the copper wire.  Its this \"intermetallic\" layer where the solder and the material being connected have created a new alloy that makes the joints strong.

When our surroundings are warmer than us, heat transfers to us and we feel warmer.  Different materials have different capacities for heat, and also rates of transfer. Air can't hold as much heat energy, and it is also more of an insulator, so we hold on to our heat better.  But water will transfer heat much better, so even though 30C water is warmer than 25C air, we are warmer than both of those, and water transfers it better. So we sense more energy leaving our body into the water, thus is feels colder.  Same as feeling room temperature wood, or room temperature copper.

    "answer": "A subject I have personal experience with!   I broke my humerus playing roller derby a few years back and the fracture severed my radial nerve, meaning I lost the ability to lift my wrist and extend my fingers.   As other posters have noted your nerves are protected by a myelin sheath, which is basically a tube around the actual nerve. If you think about your cell phone charging cable the nerve is like the metal wire inside that carries the electrical current and the myelin sheath is like the materials covering and insulating it.  When a nerve is damaged the entire portion of the nerve from the point of damage to the termination (or \u201cend\u201d) dies as well. As long as the myelin sheath remains intact or heals properly the nerve will begin to regrow from the point of damage to the termination point.   So when performing a transplant or reconstructive surgery all the surgeons can do is connect these tubes and wait for the nerve to regenerate within.   Nerves grow very slowly, about 1 inch per month. The radial nerve which I severed in my accident invenerates the hand muscles at the top of your forearm. There was approximately six inches between this point and the damage site so it took about six months to fully regain control of my hand functions.   As far as I know this only applies to nerves branching off the spinal column. The spinal nerve itself will not regenerate or heal itself in most circumstances, which is why spinal injuries usually result in permanent disabilities.   But long story short, we can\u2019t directly correct the nervous system through surgery or other intervention, we can only manipulate the tubes in which the nerves reside and wait for the nerves to repair themselves.",

The second means the rings were always there, and are stable enough to last 4.5 billions years, implying they are going nowhere.

    "answer": "CRT is sort of an umbrella framework for discussing race (and particularly race in America) across multiple fields like law, philosophy, public service, psychology, and sociology. CRT holds that race is a socially constructed (culturally invented) category that is used to oppress and exploit people of color. CRT also discusses the issue of systemic racism, and presents a framework for addressing and correcting racism that was built into institutions like law and finance.  Short version: CRT focuses on the system being inherently racist, rather than on individuals.  To answer your questions:  1. CRT seeks to approach race and racism as systemic issues, rather than the actions of individual people or groups. 2. There is lively debate both inside and outside of the academic community on CRT and how the issues should be addressed. 3. Yes and no. CRT presents a framework for working on the problem and building solutions. It does not present a \"This is how to solve racism\" checklist, and that isn't the intent. 4. White people can and should be active participants in discussions within CRT. The social and cultural systems addressed by CRT as sources of racism also impact other groups like women, LGBTQ+ people, people with disabilities, etc.",

    "answer": "Let's say you have a game that has objects. Well you generally don't want your objects passing through each other so you want the game to detect when two objects have \"collided\" so you can have them do things like explode or bounce off of each other. So you write some code for this \"collision detection.\"  Well, just about every game in the world has objects for which we need to detect collisions. So rather than every game studio in the world independently coming up with their own collision detection code from scratch, I'm just going to sell them mine. Saves them time and makes me money.  But just doing collusion detection wouldn't be efficient. So we add in just about all the stuff that's common to all games, or all games of a certain genre. Like applying gravity to objects, code for rending objects into the images you see on the screen, determining line of sight, etc. etc.  Take all of those common and ubiquitous functions that are applicable to lots of different games and package it up and now you have a game engine.  Now, buying a prepackaged game engine isn't *necessary* in the sense that you can still build a game without one, but in the end you'd just have to code all that stuff yourself anyway (basically building your own \"game engine\" piece by piece). Now if you want to build a game and not go insane doing it, and also maybe do it within your life time and to make a profit, then yes, using established game engines is pretty much a necessity.  There are many different game engines for two main reasons:  1. Some game engines are tailored for specific kind of genres. A game engine tailored for racing games will include different kinds of code than a game engine tailored for side scrollers or one tailored for first-person shooters. 2.

    "answer": "I want to point out that there are cases when stock price does not go to zero. But if it is actual Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, the shares cease to exist after everything is said and done, as there is no more company afterwards.  One good example of this was Hertz. It was believed last year that Hertz was going to go into Chapter 7 bankruptcy. However, Hertz had more assets than it did debt, if everything went perfect for Hertz then they would have had 2 dollars per share left after all was said and done, and this would have been distributed to shareholders.  When people realized this, Hertz's stock spiked from the 50 cents it was worth, because after all it was believed that if you bought a share for say 1 dollar and after liquidation you would have gotten 2 dollars from the remaining assets, it would have been profitable even if the share ceased to exist afterwards.  In the vast majority of cases, Ch 7 bankruptcy happens when a company has more debt than assets though. In that case, creditors get first dibs on any asset proceeds and shareholders get last dibs, which means they get nothing usually, and stock goes to 0 since no one is willing to buy worthless shares.",

Alternatively, oocyte agenesis (but preserving the rest of the follicle), complete failure of follicle rupture (maybe with resorption of content, see PCOS) will achieve the same effect.   If you don't want sexual maturity (lose all secondary sexual characteristics), then you can play around with the production or response to GnRH, FSH/LH, oestrogen/progesterone (each hormone from left to right stimulates production of the next one), not having ovaries.

    "answer": "There are different types, but one uses sodium acetate dissolved in water. It's a super-saturated solution, meaning that really there is more stuff dissolved in the water than the water would \"like\". So the sodium acetates \"wants\" to start come out of solution and form solid crystals. To start growing a crystal, though, you need a *nucleation site*, some little bit of something that the first sodium acetate molecules can latch onto and then gather into a crystal from there. Without a nucleation site, the sodium acetate stays in its super-saturated solution.  The hand warmer packet contains this solution along with a little strip of metal. If you bend this strip, little bits of metal come off and these provide nucleation sites for the crystals to start growing. This crystallization process is an *exothermic*, i.e. heat-releasing, reaction.  How did the heat get there? Well, to create a super-saturated solution, you need to dissolve the sodium acetate in hot water (which can hold more stuff in solution) and then let it cool. Some of the heat you put in gets stored in the solution - the heat that was necessary to get it super-saturated (in other words, the solution reaction was *endothermic*). When the excess sodium acetate crystallizes, the heat energy stored in the solution is released.  As to why it is safe, you can calculate how much heat energy will be released and thus how  hot the hand warmer will get. So you can ensure that the temperature will be in a safe range. There's no danger of a \"runaway\" reaction since you know exactly how much sodium acetate you dissolved and how much solution you put in the packet.",

What it actually refers to is a combination of pain medicine and sedation medicine that are used to keep people calm and comfortable while they have a breathing tube in.   Second, this \u201ccoma\u201d or state of sedation isn\u2019t done to treat the overdose itself. It is done again to allow for uncomfortable medical interventions such as a breathing tube and possibly cooling (targeted temperature management).  When he overdosed, his breathing became so slow and shallow and he did not get enough oxygen and he could not blow out carbon dioxide. When the heart doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen it will stop beating. When the brain doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen for long enough, it causes brain damage (anoxic brain injury).   CPR is used to circulate blood as we try to restart the heart with medication and/or shocks.  A breathing tube is placed to breath for the patient until they can breath on their own.  When a patient has cardiac/respiratory arrest, they almost always have some amount of brain damage, unless high quality CPR was started immediately. We keep them on ventilators (breathing machine connected to the breathing tube that goes down his throat) because the brain damage means he likely wont be able to breath on his own for a while. In many cases after cardiac arrest we also \u201ccool\u201d the patient. This means bringing down their body temperature low enough that it slows metabolism by brain cells and can possibly reduce long term brain damage.  In the next couple days, they will try turning down the sedation to see if he wakes up and evaluate how his brain is functioning (called a sedation vacation). If he does wake up, they will also try a spontaneous breathing trial- turning the ventilator off briefly to see if he is able to breath on his own.

    "answer": "It's actually why you're told not to stick a fork in a toaster!   Electricity has a \"direction\". Think of it like a water hose. Water goes in one end and comes out of the other end.   One side of the plug is the \"hot\" side, that's how electricity gets in to your device. The other side is the \"neutral\" side. That's how electricity gets out of your device.   To some extent it doesn't matter which way the plug is plugged in. If you plug a toaster in the \"wrong\" way it will still work. This is just like a water hose, if you put it on \"backwards\" it still works. Some electronics may be damaged if you do this, but there's a better reason why these plugs are built this way.  The right way for electricity to flow through a toaster is from the \"hot\" wire to a switch. If that switch is \"closed\" (you've turned the toaster on), electricity keeps going through the toaster and heats up the heating elements, then leaves through the neutral wire. If you have the plug turned this way and the switch is \"open\" (the toaster is not on), you can stick a fork in the toaster safely because the electricity has stopped at the switch. There is no electricity in the heating elements because the neutral wire is the \"out\" wire.   But if you plug the toaster in the other way, electricity flows from the hot side of your outlet through the neutral wire, into the heating elements, then it hits the switch. It can't actually make the toaster heat up because that takes a flow of electricity. But if you put a fork in the toaster, that fork forms a path from the hot wire to the ground through your arm, body, leg, and foot. You become the switch and turn on the toaster. That's bad news.  Same thing with lamps. If it's plugged in hot-to-hot, the switch is why you can safely change a bulb. If it's hot-to-neutral, you might get shocked if you're not super careful.   So modern devices usually have this kind of plug. It's called a \"polarized\" plug, which is a sort of misuse of that word. In a general sense it means it \"has a direction\". This ensures you don't accidentally plug a device in a way that's unsafe. But not all devices have a way to stick a fork inside or a switch to stop electrical flow, so those devices might use an unpolarized plug. For example, I don't think my laptop charger's polarized. But I also have no clue how the heck to open it, so by the time I stick a fork in it I've already made at least four other bad decisions and it's not Apple's fault.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why do some fabrics/materials make you sweat profusely without actually warming you?",
    "answer": "If you sweat then you are warm. So the clothes do keep you warm or the temperature is so high you do not need them. Let ignore the case when you would sweat with no clothes on, getting cold and freezing is not usually a problem in conditions like that.  If you sweat and have clothes on you have a problem. There is water on your skin, to keep dry it needs to move to the surrounding environment. So you need clothes that let the water through. It can be water that wicks out as a liquid from your skin and then evaporate and become a gas, it can also be water the evaporate on your skin. Regardless of how it happens if your water can't escape you will be weat.  So if you have clothes that do not let water through and sweat will stay inside them and are what.    Cloth is not warming you unless they have an active heat source, which is quite uncommon but to exist. What clothes do is reduce the rate hat is transported from your body to the environment. The way is done is primary to have material that traps a lot of air and stops it from moving. Air is a bad conductor of heat so this will keep you warm. Water is a good conductor of heat and will so water-soaked closed will transport heat away from your body and you get cold.  If you keep water from escaping you also keep air from escaping and that will reduce the rate heat is transported from your body.  So they will make you warmer but can make you warm and then you sweat.  So if you sweat profusely the clothes are keeping you warm or more exactly to warm. They might not keep you warm when they are wet but then you have stopped sweating.  One major way to stay warm is to remove clothes when you are active so you do not sweat. If you will do some physical activity that makes you warm remove clothes so you start to feel a bit too cold when stationary. When you then start to move you will get warmer and hopefully, you do not get so hot so you sweat.  It is a mistake to dress for being stationary and then start moving. Regardless of what material your clothes are made of you will sweat and if it can't escape you get colder when you stop. Dress in layers and adjust the clothing to your activity,",

    "answer": "ARM and x86 are [instruction set architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture) (ISAs). An ISA can be thought of as a \"programming language\" specification for CPUs: it defines the interface for how you talk to the CPU and what you should expect out of it.  ARM is a reduced instruction set ([RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer)) architecture, while x86 is a complex instruction set ([CSIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer)) architecture. The ELI5 version of that is x86 has way more instructions in its language, and the shape and behavior of those instructions are far more complicated.  For example, x86 instructions are variable-length, meaning the instruction decoder needs to read each byte to determine how many more bytes to read next in order to decode the instruction.  The x86 ISA also has instructions that can manipulate memory directly, while in ARM, you would have to perform all operations on registers before storing those registers back to memory with an appropriate instruction. Technically it's an abstraction, since under the hood, the CPU may well be loading the memory location into a hidden register, performing the requested operation on it, and then store it back to memory, but to you it looks like one instruction.  TL;DR, you can think of them as different programming languages, where x86 has more language features, at the expense of complexity.",

Most modern cars are front wheel drive with the engine mounted sideways in the front with a trans-axle connecting it to the wheels.   This has the advantage that you don't need a drive shaft running through the length of the car. The engine and transmission can also be installed as a compact unit which makes assembly easier and faster.  All the engine weight also pushes down on the drive wheels which helps with traction and braking and therefore makes the car safer.

    "answer": "A naked short is an illegal practice in which an institution borrows a share of a stock and shorts it, except the share has not been determined to exist.   For example, say there are 1 million shares of a company. A normal short would be borrowing 100 shares and paying a premium to open a contract giving you the right to sell those shares at a price (the strike price) regardless of what the price is. This means if the stock goes down you can sell it for more than its worth. A naked short, is borrowing shares that aren\u2019t determined to exist. This means if there are 1 million shares, and someone\u2019s buys short contracts worth more shares than what exist in the market, it\u2019s artificial.   This is illegal because it creates an artificial market with non existent shares and mostly undermines the whole system. However this is a common practice by many financial institutions such as hedge funds (citadel for example).   As for what happened on CNBC, an anchor woman actually called what the current hedge funds and market participants naked shorting, in reference to AMC and GameStop stock. This is significant because naked shorting is illegal. So a trusted financial news source like CNBC on air saying it\u2019s naked shorting is validating the reason why many people are buying and holding shares of company\u2019s like AMC and GameStop.

    "answer": "If I'm not mistaken, you're asking why in an enclosed are like a room, walls aren't always continuous but have columns sticking out. Is that it?  The answer is that, except in special cases, walls do not support anything (but their own weight), but columns do. This is why when you see a building being constructed, you see the frame (beams and columns) being built first, and then walls built later. This is why you sometimes see beams sticking out from the sides of the roof. In this case, we say that walls (called curtain walls) are not an active structural element: they do not contribute to the supporting frame. They're there like curtains: because nobody likes to live in a room with no walls (but they're also helpful in avoiding certain complex loads).  Slabs that make the floor are typically supported by the horizontal beams on the side (and sometimes columns when they're huge). Beams are supported by columns around the corners, and they're sometimes hidden. Columns are supported by the frame from the lower level, and so on..all the way to the foundations.

    "question": "ELI5: Why does driving at high (interstate) speeds and hitting standing water (deep enough to splash) cause you to feel a push perpendicular to your car's movement?",
    "answer": "Hoo boy. That is a simple question with a very complex answer. To understand why you need to understand torque and angular momentum in spinning bodies.  So the basics you need to know is we measure the force of something spinning by its angular momentum. This force is a tangent to the circle or a straight line only intersecting the spin at one point. You can visualize this by spinning something on the end of a string then letting it go. That object on a string will fly off in one direction. That direction is the direction of the force being applied at that moment. Which indicates to you the direction of it's angular momentum.  Now we go to torque. To make something spin it needs to be fixed to a singular point. There must be an axis which it spins around and resists that straight line force we call angular momentum. Otherwise the spin would just turn to linear force. As we know from physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. So as the axis pulls against the object, so to must the object pull against the axis. That pull on the axis is what we call a torque. The direction of that torque force is defined with a right hand rule. If you point your right hand and curl your fingers in the direction of the spin and stick your thumb out, the direction of your thumb is the direction of the torque force. Notice your thumb is now pointing perpendicular to the spin.   (A YouTube video to explain it in depth https://youtu.be/mRZGdvJQnPU)  Now we tie that back into your car. So all 4 wheels on your car are spinning. As we just established that means they have angular momentum and torque. Fortunately for you the torque is normally not enough to overcome the friction between your tires and the road. So you never feel that torque. However, when you hit a deep enough puddle, all that friction is removed and the perpendicular torque force of your car easily can pull you sideways.",

There's a lot of stuff happening in public just for the sake of looking good.  Australia wanted attack subs to counter china. France, US, UK all have a big presence in the Pacific and wanted Aus to be more involved, and Aus did too.  The best subs are nuke subs. However, no one is willing to sell nuke subs, because no one likes exporting nuclear military tech. So Aus had only 1 option, to buy new, but completely obsolete diesel subs.  France won the deal to provide them subs. It was the biggest military deal in French history and a huge deal. But again... this was for obsolete subs.  Behind the scenes, the UK started pressuring the US to say \"hey, it would be super cool if you sold Aus nuke subs, we know you absolutely don't do that, but maybe you would here.\" The US--unexpectedly agreed, yup, we'll sell em nuke subs. This ended up being part of a larger defense agreement between US, UK, and Aus.  Aus was absolutely jumping up and down, these US nuke subs are epicly better than anything France would provide.  Aus canceled their order with France to take US nuke subs instead-- the obvious choice, its WAY better, no one is arguing that.

More automation means less jobs for humans, which in turn means humans don't get paid, and won't be able to afford even to most basic things like housing, clothing, or food.  But that also means there must be a change which makes it possible for people to still be able to survive. Something like a Basic Income, where everyone gets some amount of money regularly that is able to fund those basic things.  Which means people wouldn't be able to not afford housing or food anymore.

    "answer": "An engine does not have infinite power or rev ability. It requires more effort to accelerate than to cruise. Lower gears mean that the engine is turning more times (more power) for every time the wheel turns. This gives it the extra oomph to accelerate. But the engine can only rev so high, so more gears are needed to go faster. As you go faster the gear ratio changes meaning the engine is turning less times for every rev of the wheel. This creates efficiency at high cruising speeds for better gas mileage. It only takes about 15 horsepower to keep a car going at speed, while it takes many more ponies to get up to that speed. All that being said, there is a style of transmission known as a continuously variable transmission, which doesn't change gears so much as smoothly changes the ratio as needed while driving, resulting in a smooth acceleration without changing individual gears.",

    "answer": "There can be a bunch of different reasons.  First, there are different kinds of motors. \"Brushed\" motors are cheaper, but the way they're put together makes them louder and more likely to break. \"Brushless\" motors are more expensive, quieter, and easier to maintain. But some high-quality appliances use brushless motors and are still loud. Why?  Size and cost are big reasons.   Appliance motors have to be very small and fit in small spaces. They generate a lot of heat and need to pull in air to cool themselves. There's not a lot of room for sound dampening or vibration isolation, and it would make the appliances cost more. Further, a lot of the premium devices are sold based on how much power they have, and people think a louder motor has more power. (They've never thought about how a lawnmower is often louder than a car!) So not a lot of people are really shopping for a *quiet* blender or vacuum, especially if it means they become so large they aren't easy to use or so expensive they aren't worth it.   Car motors, on the other hand, are part of a very expensive purchase. People expect them to be quiet, it's one of their selling points.

(Another, equivalent, way to put this is that the electric charges of particles are much bigger than their masses in some sense.)  Put another way, gravity is about as much weaker than the electromagnetic force as you are smaller than a large star cluster.  This means that it's very hard to get gravity to create measurable effects in a laboratory, even in the most energetic particle accelerators.

Since there isn't much stuff in space, the total thermal energy of any volume is stupidly low because 50 hydrogen atoms don't have much heat between them  The problem with space is that it is really low temperature so its not going to put heat into any object in it, but there's nothing around to conduct heat into so heat can only be lost through very slow radiative cooling, basically IR waves wiggling off into space with the energy.

It's called base-2 because there are only two digits. Our usual numbering is base 10, because it has 10 digits (0-9).  In binary, 10 is the same as 2 in base 10. 11 is 3. (the 1 on the right is 1, and the 1 on the left is 2, add them up and you get 3). 100 is 4. 101 is 5. 110 is 6 (4+2). 111 is 7. 1000 is 8. And on and on.

    "question": "ELI5 - How are QR codes made and how do they work?",
    "answer": "I can write the word \"cat\" with a crayon. But when my wife writes the word \"cat\" with her crayon, it looks completely different. Her handwriting is nicer than mine and my letters look squiggly and ugly compared to hers. Same letters, they just look different. You can make letters on a screen look different, too. That's called a \"font\". Just like different handwriting... same letters that just look a little different. A QR code is really just a weird font. It's handwriting that looks so funny that only a specialist can read it. (Your scanner is the specialist.)  Did you ever notice that QR codes always have three corners that look like plain boxes? That's how the computer knows which side is the top. If you look at a book that's upside down, you know to turn it over before you try to read it. Those boxes tell the computer which way to turn it before it tries to read it.  There's also something called \"error correction\" built in. If I put a dot here for the letter \"c\", then I also put a dot over there to represent that same \"c\". I don't need both dots; I can use either one. But that way, if part of my QR code gets scratched off or dirty, I have a better chance of reading the right message because the clean parts still have enough information.  And finally, there's something called a \"checksum\". A checksum is a small fact about what you just read. For example, I might say \"cat(3)\". That 3 at the end would mean that you should have read a 3-letter word. Or maybe I say \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.(23,12)\" and that means you should have read 23 consonants and 12 vowels. If what you read doesn't match the checksum, then you should try reading it again. A barcode scanner can actually read a barcode multiple times if it has to to get it right.  Quick note: There are many different types of barcodes: UPC, QR, Aztec, Code9. There's a different one on your mail. There's a different one on the sticker on the fruit you buy at the grocery store. They're all just different \"fonts\". Some, but not all, use error correction. Some, but not all, use checksums. Some use both. Some use neither.",

The bank was willing to provide that money because, should you fail to pay, they can seize the house and sell it to cover their losses from your cancelled mortgage.  If the housing price is falling, then the bank has more at risk. Say you still have $450,000 outstanding on the mortgage, but now the house is only worth $300,000 due to a market crash. If you fail to pay, the bank will be screwed. At best, they lose $150,000 by selling the house at $300,000. Much more likely, they will have to sell lower than that.

Taken alone, it seems arbitrary and boring, but the ratio of each number pair gets closer and closer to a very special number in nature called phi (pronounced fee), which is also known as the golden or divine ratio.  Just as the greek letter pi represents the (approximate) value of 3.14 and is a special number relating to the circumference of circles, phi, which represents a value around 1.6,  has an odd way of showing up in all sorts of natural phenomena. We see this ratio in spirals, such as the spiral of a hurricane, the spiral of the milky way galaxy, or even snail shells. We see it in the proportions of our own anatomy: the ratio of the successive digits of your fingers, or of your hand to your forearm is approximately 1.6 etc. There are many more examples if you do a Google image search for the golden ratio.  Then universality of this relationship lead philosophers to regard it as almost like gods calling card, an artifact of the divine source code that created the natural world (hence the divine ratio). A more secular argument would say something similar but drop god from the equation and say it has something to do with fundamental forces that govern the physical world.   Regardless of the explanation, it seems generally accepted that this ratio is related not just to physical phenomenon but also to our perception of physical beauty. As such it is often utilized in art, especially after the the renaissance, with lots old old famous paintings incorporating the golden ratio. even contemporary marketing firms attempt to utilize it in brand logos, believing it a sort of shortcut to creating an aesthetically pleasing image (the new pepsi logo is an example of this approach in marketing)  Hope that helps!",

    "question": "ELI5: What is Cyclic Voltammetry and what does it aim to do?",
    "answer": "It's been a long time since I've done this so forgive me any errors or omissions.  You have some substance in a solution. Then you stick electrodes into it and apply voltage to it. You slowly increase the voltage to some set amount over time, then once you get to the max you slowly decrease it back down. The whole time you're measuring how much current flows, which in turn tells you about how much resistance the solution you're analyzing has at each level of voltage. This is generally done by some computerized set up or machine that controls the voltage and measures the current/resistance and plots it on a graph [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_voltammetry#/media/File:Cyclovoltammogram.jpg). It's also generally done several times in a row. So you might go from 0V to 12V (or -9V to 9V or whatever) then back to 0V then back to 12V for several repetitions. This is where the word \"cyclic\" in the name comes from.  So what's the point? Well we're measuring the electrochemical properties of whatever's in the solution. If you get nice smooth line instead of something like that picture I linked above, there's not much interesting going on chemically, it only really tells you about what the electrical resistance of the solution is. In that picture I linked, the substance is undergoing some kind of chemical reaction as the voltage goes up and down, specifically an oxidation-reduction reaction. Those two humps (one hump is oxidation, the other is reduction) going up and down tell you what at what voltage the reaction occurs. The size of the humps (peak current) tells you a bunch of stuff about the reaction that I can't exactly remember at the moment.  There's a number of other things you can measure with this technique (and I'm surely forgetting most of them). One of the interesting ones though is that you can keep running the experiment for a long time having it constantly sweep back and forth. Then you can count how many sweeps it takes until the humps in the graph diminish in size by some appreaciable amount. This gives an idea of how many times the substance your measuring can react back and forth (this is a reversible reaction after all, though if you only get one sweep it means the reaction is not reversible). So, for example, you might be testing some material you want to use for a battery. This measurement gives an idea about how many times that battery could recharge.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why do public infrastructure projects very often run behind schedule and over budget all around the world?",
    "answer": "As a reformed project manager (not civil): unlike in some fields like maybe software, or in infrastructure projects where more of the entire project is _entirely_ under you control (say in building an airport or erecting a new chemical refinery), civil projects have SOOO many pieces going on. And quite a few of them are NOT under your control.   If you work for BP and you're building a new refinery, you've done your environmental compliance assessment, you've lined up your contractors years in advance, you own the land and you don't care about the interruption to your other facilities - you've already dealt with it to as to not interrupt. And if your workers have to go the long way around, well, you're just paying them overtime. THe only one affected is you/your corporation.   Civil projects: well you gotta have public consultations, you have to re-route utilities, redirect traffic, do site work and thousands of other things _before you sink a shovel_. AND, all the things to reverse this are scheduled to happen AFTER the bridge is done. If ANYTHING goes wrong with the actual bridge building, everything gets thrown for a loop. Bus line 207 got re-routed but was scheduled to resume over the bridge next week? The re-route requires six additional bussess per shift, that's six extra drivers, six extra busses. They're needed to backfill the south boulevard re-route because of the new sewer on Ocean st. in a week. If the bridge project takes longer now I need six MORE buses and drivers. Oh and you have no direct control over this, this is the transit planner and they don't like you by the way.   So, you can mitigate a lot of these by having contingnecy plans. But those require resources to be reserved and allocated all of which costs money. I can plan you a project that comes in on schedule but if it has to be able to absorb any and all possibilities itll cost you - you probably won't like it.   A good example: my city was laying a railway underpass. Every day the rail line was disrupted cost the city $XXXXXX.  They're pouring concrete in Febuary... in Canada. The weather was forecast to be good for _that particular week_, but below a certain temperature concrete doesn't set right or it cracks or something (I dunno, Im not civil). So to protect the pour they threw up a big heated tent large enough for the machines and shotcrete trucks. Cost like $1.2M. Oh my god did the peons have a field day with _that_. Never mind that had the bridge not been completed on time (and if the concrete doesn't pour correctly you have to do it over. All of it.) the city would have been paying the railway like $100k per day or more. So $1.2M to protect against what could have been much more than that... seems like a deal to me.   So yeah. Civil projects are a balance between cost and what the city can afford, minimizing interactions with other government departments, minimizing disruption to people, business and traffic. There's lots of communication and inter-dependency and if _anything_ goes wrong (heaven forbid your archeology survey didn't catch an indigenous burial ground) everything else falls apart or falls into some very expensive contingency plans.",

You can only have one heart because of the way your body is laid out.  Your heart is kinda in the middle-ish of your body, and all of your blood *has* to go to your heart, make a detour through your lungs to pick up oxygen, and then swish around your body to drop the oxygen off.   If you had two hearts, this carefully-choreographed system just wouldn\u2019t work.  But kidneys.   Kidneys are special.  They\u2019re unusual.   They kinda just float in your abdomen, at the back.   Some people only have one, and some people have three naturally.  It doesn\u2019t make much difference.   Weird, right?  Kidneys filter your blood.   All your blood passes through them, and they push out the excess water and salt, and other dissolved waste products.   This trickles down into your bladder and you pee it out.  Now, you can pretty much attach as many of these kidney tubes as you like to your bladder.   So if a kidney still has some function, there is no reason to cut it out.   It\u2019s helping, even if it is not enough by itself to keep a person alive.   In a person with kidney problems, it\u2019s pertinent to give them every bit of help possible.   And you can have three kidneys with no problems at all.  That\u2019s why they leave it in unless it\u2019s literally dead or dying.",

    "answer": "Warm up before, stretch after.  Warming up serves as a low intensity precursor to high intensity movement. It allows muscles to be oxygenated and warmed so that fibres can be stretched. Animals often move for periods at a time at low activity, keeping them warmed up in case of high activity because the need to conserve calories.  Stretching precents muscle shortening due to training or strain. Animals often stretch after rest but because we train for performance, we need to stretch ao that we do not lose range of motion.

    "answer": "The two of waves coming are discarded batteries and discarded solar panels. Right now, pretty much all lithium ion batteries (from laptop computers and power tools) end up in the landfill. That's chump change compared to the batteries of an electric car.  The thing is, you usually don't throw away a car, you trade it in. If a dealer or manufacturer can recoup costs by recycling batteries, there's a business reason to do it. So that's a plus. I'm willing to bet that car batteries will be largely recycled because the auto industry already has a strong incentive to reclaim what they can.  Solar panels, on the other hand, have about a 30 year lifespan. It's a newer industry, but the construction industry in general, doesn't have the strong incentives for recycling.

Sometimes it can be caused by head/neck muscles strains.     more ELI5 : **some brain vessels dilated => trigeminal nerve sends information to brainstem that we have some \"brain\" pain => pain**  In migraine, it's usually the same pathway BUT this cranial nerve (trigeminal) is in a \"panic mode\". It reacts so much to this input, that he releases special chemicals (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), P substance etc) that exacerbate blood vessels dilation and cause more inflammation which AGAIN amplifies the vasodilation, leakage of blood vessels, and degranulation of mast cells (immune response) and the sensory input receives this information and makes MORE substances to evoke a more stronger response.  more ELI5: **some brain vessels dilated => trigeminal nerve makes substances that trigger immune response/more vasodilation AND sends information to brainstem that we have some serious \"brain\" pain => big pain => trigeminal nerve makes MORE substances in response to that brainstem response => MORE and WORSE pain.**    And in migraine this cycle can be triggered by diffent stimuli (coffee, low glucose, light, tiredness, lack of sleep etc)   But still the EXACT mechanisms of these condition are not well understood.",

If something can do all three of those things, then they technically have enough power to do anything any other computer can. Whether it can do it at the same speed or not, well, Turing completeness makes no promises about speed.  An analogy to Turing completeness would be like if there was something called \"math complete\", which checked if a language could do all mathematical operations.  If there was a language that could perform addition on any number, then it would be \"math complete\". Why? Because it can simulate subtraction by changing the second number to negative (e.g. it can do 8 - 5 by performing 8 + -5). It can simulate multiplication by adding repeatedly (e.g. it can do 2 * 3 by performing 2 + 2 + 2). It can simulate division by counting how many times it needs to add to reach a number (e.g. it can do 6 \u00f7 2 by performing 2 + 2 + 2 and observing that it takes three 2s to make 6).  A language that can only do addition is slower and longer than a language that can do all mathematical operations, but it can still get the answer at the end of the day.  Likewise, something that is Turing-complete can compute anything any other Turing-complete computer can calculate. It may be slower and its instructions may be much longer and much more complicated, but there will be an equivalent way to write instructions for it to perform the same calculation another computer can do.",

    "question": "ELI5: How do rich people hide money in off shore accounts and why can't everyone else do the same ?",
    "answer": "A lot of the focus on this thread has been on \"how do you move money offshore\".  But there are a few other ways rich people avoid paying taxes that I haven't seen in this thread yet.  1. Imagine you have a construction business in the US.  You go build something, you get paid $10M, it costs $9M to build the thing, $1M of money flows through to you, you pay US taxes on $1M.  Now imagine that in addition to your construction business in the US, you have a shell company set up in the Cayman Islands.  Your US business gets the contract to go build the thing for $10M.  But now, in scenario 2, your US business hires your Cayman Islands business to do the work.  Your Cayman Islands business charges your US business $9.95M.  Now only $50k flows through to you in the US, and you pay US taxes on the $50k.  Your Cayman Islands business still had to spend $9M on building the thing you got paid $10M to build, so it has $950K left that it earns now as 'corporate profit'.  In the Cayman Islands, that $950K has 0 tax applied to it.  In this scenario, your money is now \"stuck\" in the Cayman Islands.  However, your Cayman Island company that has $950K can buy various things you might be able to make use of (houses, jets, etc.)  Your usage of those things is technically taxable in the US, but it can become hard to enforce. It can also invest the money to make more money, and no taxes would be owned on it until it was distributed to you. 2. Minimize your state tax bill by 'residing' in a 0 state tax state.  There are 9 of them - Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.  Most very rich people have a home in at least one of these states that they claim - rightly or wrongly - is their primary residence.  The Tri-State area (NY, NJ, CT) and California have tried to clamp down on this, but in the end, if you can avoid spending 180 days in those states, you're home free of state tax. 3. Minimize your federal tax bill with loss carry forwards and depreciation expense.  This was a big one for Trump, but is widely used.  Any assets you own, including commercial real estate, you're allowed to depreciate over a 'useful life'.  That depreciation counts as an expense - even though no cash was spent - against the income you pay the federal government.  You can also offset your income with other 'investment' losses, that can sometimes be creatively finagled.  The IRS frowns on 'creativity' like this, and most of it is borderline illegal or completely illegal (but not all - if you invest all your money in GME for fun, you'll be able to write that off eventually), but, enforcement is low since the IRS has such a low enforcement budget. 4. Never realize your profits from investments.  Similar to #1 where a shell company in the Caymans lets you delay realizing profits, there is a tax loophole called the **1031 exchange** which lets you delay realizing assets from property.  It was partly closed in the 2017 tax bill (for all assets other than real estate), but of course was left open for real estate by our real estate developer president.  With 1031, say you bought a house in 2000 to rent out (and you have your Cayman company to manage it, so they keep the profits from rent).  It makes a bunch of money every year, you invest some of the money back to make the house nicer, it still depreciates some giving you some tax write-off, etc.  Fast forward to 2021.  You paid $1M for the house in 2000.  You put $2M of improvements in over the years from rental income.  The market is now red hot, and the house is now worth $10M.  If you did your accounting right, you now have $7M of capital gain ($9M if you didn't).  BUT, if you sell the house and use the money to buy another house or other piece of real estate for $10M, you owe $0 in taxes.  You can get even more creative, and sell your business as a piece of real estate (in certain circumstances) to use this loophole.  For example, I know of a case where a film studio was sold as a real estate transaction.  There was absolutely real estate involved (they needed somewhere to shoot), but part of the value of the 'real estate' was the business that ran within it (including contracts to shoot in the studio, and the studio's reputation or 'good will').  The studio gets sold for $100M or $200M or whatever it was, but it gets called a 'real estate sale'.  The ex-studio owner then had 45 days to identify $100M+ of property to buy - so he bought dozens of houses in a few very hot rental markets.  He avoids paying taxes on his big sale, and now has rental income (which comes with depreciation write offs, and can be directed elsewhere).  &#x200B;  Why can't everyone do the same?  These structures cost money to set up and some require playing games with real estate, which has high barriers to entry.",

If the speaker and microphone are a metre apart (say, between your monitor and a headset mic) then that \"fundamental\" frequency would be 330Hz (sound travels at about 330 metres per second in air) which sounds like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX8KZx5RDg8)  This isn't all that high pitched, but that's where *harmonics* come in!  Any sound at a frequency that's a simple multiple of the main harmonic (e.g. 2x330=660Hz, 3x330=990Hz etc.) will *also* be repeated.  Most usually, the sound that triggers this kind of feedback is a fairly sharp click noise, such as you get when you plug something in. These sounds have *lots* of high frequency components, and any of these that are a multiple of the fundamental will join in the feedback party.  Why do we only hear the high frequencies? Because there are only a couple of \"low\" frequencies that are multiples of that fundamental, and far more at higher frequencies.  Human hearing spans around 20Hz-20KHz, so the feedback would likely include 330, 660, 990, all the way up to 19,800Hz (maybe higher depending on your hearing)  That's a total of around 60 different frequencies, and only the first few would sound \"low\" - the highest ones would be fairly painful to hear at any volume.",

Outside very specialized and explicit contracts, called \"cost plus\" and almost exclusively used in government/military contracts, the price has nothing to do with the cost.  Products get their final price by the seller guessing what they can charge that will maximize profit (like /u/ViolettPapillon describes). This is entirely based on the buyers' willingness to pay, NOT what the product cost to produce.   The only role cost plays is that if your suspected price is lower than your cost, you don't enter the market at all (because you think you'll lose money). As long as you reasonably believe you can charge more than it costs, you will price it as high as you think the buyer will pay. This is called \"value pricing\" and is FAR more common than cost-plus.",

    "answer": "Earth rotates VERY slowly relative to its size. Once a day, which is twice as slow as the hour handle on the clock. The speed of the surface doesn't matter, humans can't feel the speed, we only feel the change in speed, which is acceleration. And by rotating once every 24 hours the change in the direction of the speed is very small. Earth also rotates very uniformly and to same direction, so even with faster rotation, it would just feel like the gravity is weaker.  This is called centrifugal force, which can be calculated for the earth:  [https://i.imgur.com/PSXL6K5.png](https://i.imgur.com/PSXL6K5.png)  So if we put a human on the equator and calculate how much the centrifugal force of the rotating earth makes the human lighter, it's about 2 newtons of force, which is about 200 grams lighter on earth's surface.

    "answer": "Spectrum analysers often work based on something called the Fast Fourier Transform.  This is a mathematical technique which lets us look at a wave, let's say the sound of a lion's roar, and instead of looking at how it changes over time (like having a loud beginning, slowly getting quieter, and a few grumbles at the end), asking what other waves it is made of.  That feels like a big jump, but it's simpler than you think. Sticking with sound, you may know that the pitch of a sound is determined by something called it's frequency. This is mostly true, but it's not the full picture. Sounds are made up of lots and lots of frequencies all added together. This is what makes a violin sound different to a flute if they're playing the same note. What this means is that if you take a very simple wave which genuinely only has a single frequency, called a sine wave, and start adding very special amounts of other waves of very specific frequencies, you can actually build sounds from scratch - this is called \"additive synthesis\", by the way.  What the Fast Fourier Transform does is tell you exactly what amount of *all* frequencies have gone into making whatever wave it's looking at. This is sometimes called a \"decomposition\", because it is looking at what the wave is composed of.  Why is it associated with ghost hunters?

You have one high level goal in running Amazon - make money for yourself, and make money for your shareholders. You can accomplish that goal in two ways, sell more things and reduce your expenses. You're probably already selling as much as you can, so the easiest way to have the lowest possible expenses is to pay your employees as little as you can get away with. Most of the rest of the economy is run by other Bezoses who have more or less the same goals - workers are, as a result, forced to work for less than the value of their labour because there's a lack of better options.  Theres a snowball effect that takes place here - the bigger Amazon gets, the more money and influence you have and the more you're able to accept risks and expand your company - big companies have an easier time getting even bigger than smaller ones. You're also more able to influence government policy by lobbying or threatening to move jobs abroad if, say, minimum wage or tax rates were to increase. As more and more of the economy is absorbed by these massive corporations smaller businesses where individuals or small groups of employees have bargaining power fall by the wayside. A single worker at your company has no ability to demand a better wage since they can easily be fired and replaced by an even more desperate person who needs the wage to live.  To put it as simply as possible, those middle class jobs have begun to disappear because it's more profitable to pay your employees less. The less of those jobs there are the more people are forced to work lower paying jobs out of desperation, and as more people work in these jobs at or below the poverty line they become less able to have any influence on this system as they have no time to politically organize when they're working two jobs and no bargaining power when they're easily replaceable.

It's like asking why a person doesn't come back to life after you've removed the bullet that killed them from their brain. Dead is dead.  But not all dinosaurs went extinct. Notably, they survive today as birds. Why didn't birds, then, become \"dominant?\"  This begs the question of what it means to be \"dominant.\" More often than not, humans define \"dominant\" by the traits humans happen to have (tool use, cooperation, intelligence, technology, ability to manipulate our environment). But that's just circular. There are a number of ways in which we *aren't* dominant:  Live on earth for the longest duration? Cyanobacteria.  Total biomass? Antarctic krill.  Longevity? Plenty of species are biologically immortal.  Biggest impact on the environment? Maybe humans, historically, probably cyanobacteria again.  Even the manner in which we divide up living organisms into species is based on manmade constructs. In reality, nature doesn't quite conform to the nice discrete boxes we have made for it.  Setting aside the question of human's dominance, it's probably less contentious to say that mammals in general saw quite a degree of success (success being measured by reproductive success and the explosion of new species and areas occupied) following the fall of the dinosaurs and we can attribute that to a number of reasons:  * Being small and fur-covered, mammals are better adapted to cooler climates, and the earth entered a cooling period after the extinction of the dinosaurs. * The elimination of many large dinosaur species created power vacuums that mammals filled. * Process of elimination.

Basically, if you don't sleep enough then your body has less energy to fight illness or irritants, your sinuses block up, and the pressure causes deep bruising.   This is what I've been told as one reason for dark circles, although I'm sure there are others, and sometimes the cause isn't known at all. I have chronic sinusitis and so sometimes look like I almost have black eyes, the dark circles reach up along my nose to my eyebrows. I asked my doctor about it after they wouldn't go away with sleep and they said pollen was likely the cause. Happens when I'm overtired too though.",

    "question": "ELI5: If electrical providers share the same power lines, how do they know who is consuming whose power?",
    "answer": "In ERCOT (Texas) everything was \"unbundled\" when the industry was de-regulated (or re-regulated depending on your viewpoint). So generation is independent of transmission and distribution. Energy Service Providers (ESP's) sell energy to the end consumer buy buying energy from the generators through a QSE (Qualified Scheduling Entity) and delivering to the end user on transmission and distribution lines, which may or may not be one company. The distribution company (the \"Wires\" company) is the one that delivers your power to point of use. This is the one you have no choice over, since each has it's own territory.  Energy at every point (generation, transmission, distribution) is metered by extremely accurate meters that have to meet exacting standards. These are the \"settlement\" meters. There are also the meters on your home.  The \"settlement\" meters are  all time stamped at a minimum of every 15 minutes, although I believe generation is actually at 5 minute intervals. All this metering data is routed through ERCOT where generation output is matched against all the various transmission/distribution metering points, and ultimately balanced out against the end metering at your house. This is the only way it can be done, since the grid is entirely interconnected (internally), so generation is about like pumping a water well into a river, then monitoring who pulls water out.  Once all the data has been processed, fund allocations are made based on who bought what from whom at what price and what time. Even though the metering has 15 minutes intervals, the billing is usually done on an hourly basis.  Anyone can play. Grid generation is determined by who can offer \"base\" load at the cheapest price. This is the load that is pretty much there all the time. The \"intermediate\" load (i.e., the day gets warmer and load goes up from base) is the generation that is slightly more expensive. The highest cost generation comes on at peak (late afternoon in a Texas summer). The ESP's (remember them) try to study their load patterns, weather predictions, etc. and arrange through the QSE's to acquire given amounts of power at given times. Since \"anyone can play\" this means that the end user (you) can use a solar or wind turbine to generate back into the grid through your house meter and receive compensation.  ESP's are responsible for their costs. If they don't schedule enough energy, they end up paying a premium price at peak loads (aka, the recent ice storm). On the flip side, if they schedule too much and don't need it, they can either try to sell it on the market, or pay for it even though they didn't need it.  The \"wires\" companies get their money by fixed rates based on their \"cost of service\" and often tie in an extra charge based on kwh usage. They do not market \"energy\" unless they are an Electric Cooperative (which I think is unique to ERCOT). So the \"wires\" companys roll is to provide the actual service and metering.  There are more \"fun and games\" money making schemes like Congestion Revenue Rights if you want to look up an example of capitalism at it's finest (or worst).",

    "question": "ELI5: How are credit/debit cards with chips more secure than others when most card readers have a \"Bypass PIN\" option that allows the transaction to go through without any additional verification? It seems to me that this is less secure than an old chipless card that at least requires a PIN.",
    "answer": "The chip and/or the PIN are a means of verifying the transaction is legit.  On a card without the chip, the only data is its number, the expiration date, and maybe the verification code on the back. The magnetic stripe is usually just the card number. These kinds of terminals require the PIN because (hopefully) only the authorized cardholder knows that PIN. These cards are easy to duplicate so we NEED extra security measures.  Cards with a chip, on the other hand, are a lot harder to replicate. The chip is actually a tiny computer that does some math on some inputs and generates numbers in a way that isn't easy to guess even if you see it done for a few thousand inputs. The bank who issues the card knows the secret information that makes it possible to predict the numbers. So, oversimplified, when you use a chip reader, the terminal gives the chip some inputs, gets the chip's result, then sends the inputs and the results to the bank. The bank verifies that the inputs should produce that output on your chip. So in a way, the chip IS the PIN, but it's more secure than that because you can't accidentally give someone knowledge that makes them able to replicate your chip.  It's probably possible to copy a card with a chip, but it would take a high degree of sophistication and someone would have to physically steal your card to do it. You can't reproduce the chip from observing a single read, and in theory even seeing hundreds of thousands of input/output wouldn't be useful. Because it's incredibly close to impossible to duplicate these chips, when a terminal uses the chip as an ID you don't have to use a PIN. The assumption is it means someone would've had to have stolen your actual card and you'd probably notice that much more quickly than it takes to figure out someone's skimmed a traditional card.",

    "answer": "Economies of scale. Due to large overhead costs (equipment, land, etc) being present in farming even at low volumes, but being relatively stable as production grows, that overhead cost shrinks when calculating cost per unit as production increases.   Let's say you have a $100k tractor to plant corn. If you plant 1000 stalks of corn, the cost of that tractor is allocated as $100k/1000 units, or $100/unit. If you plant 1 million stalks, your cost per unit shrinks to $0.10/unit in terms of operating that tractor, presuming you have the land to do it already and all else stays equal with the tractor.   Mass production farms capitalize on this significantly,  but building these economies of scale takes time and investment.

    "question": "ELI5: Why do \"red skies at morning\" mean it's going to storm later that day?",
    "answer": "It has to do with the scattering of incoming solar radiation. It is called Rayleigh scattering. the way weather systems travel is from west to east.   The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  Incoming solar radiation deflected sideways at an angle. If that angle is high then it brings about blue skies and such. If there is a blue sunrise that, to me, as a weather forecaster tells me I have low pressure to my east. The storm has passed.   As a result of low pressure being to my east, I will have high pressure to my west. High pressure is associated with good weather and great conditions. The high pressure is to come and move over my station.   High pressure brings about a low sun angle because it condenses the atmosphere. This low sun angle gives us our red sunrises and sunsets.  Edit: This is more of a mid latitude United States phenomenon. I decided to give it another shot\u2014 see below  Sun rises in the east and sets in the west.    Cool.   If at any point the sun rise or sun set is the color orange, red, or pink it can be inferred that the atmosphere is being condensed under the influence of high pressure. Because the sun is low in the sky and the atmosphere is condensed this is used to locate where high pressure is. Whether it is departing or arriving to you.   On the other hand, low pressure within the atmosphere allows it to expand. Therefore, wherever low pressure is located the sky at sun rise and sun set will not appear the colors aforementioned but will be your usual blue sky. This is due to the lack of condensation in the atmosphere. It allows the blue to be seen instead of the other colors on the visible spectrum.   In the mid latitudes (not the equator or the poles) between 60 degrees N and 30 degrees N there is the polar front jet (jet stream) that is high in the sky and it helps high pressure and low pressure move across mid latitudes in a west to east fashion as this is the only way the wind travels in the polar front jet. So this is the way low pressure systems (more commonly frontal boundaries) move with high pressure ahead and behind the fronts.   Weather is fluid and ever changing.

At a disc manufacturing plant, a master is used to stamp or etch physical pits into a disc. But recordable discs use a dye or metal alloy that a higher-energy laser can heat to change the reflectivity.  HDDs use a magnetic platter to record the data. An actuator arm moves to different locations on the spinning disc, and the magnetic polarity of each microscopic sector determines the data.  SSDs store electric charge in NAND flash cells.

Instead it can be thought of using banks and interest: (For true ELI5, interest means \"the bank will add 'this much' to your money at the specified time)  If we have a bank that generously offers 100% interest every year, and you give them $1, then after a year you will have $2.  But wait! A rival bank wants to offer 50% interest TWICE a year if you bank with them. At first, you may think that 50% twice = 100% once, but that isn't the case. After 6 months with this bank, your total + interest will be $1.50. Then another 6 months later it would be $2.25, getting $0.75 from 50% of the $1.50.  So it would seem that even if the % interest adds to the same 100%, getting it more often leads to giving you more money! So what about a bank that offers 25% interest every 3 months? Or 8.3% every month? How about an inconceivablely small percentage interest at every fraction of a millisecond throughout the year?  You'll find that the final amount tends toward the value of e if you were able to gain interest at a \"natural\" rate of growth.  100% once a year: $2  50% twice a year: $2.25  25% four times a year: $2.4414  8.3% twelve times a year: $2.613035  Every possible moment in a year: $2.71828 (approaching the value of e)  e is also important in Calculus and the natural log, but those are waaaay beyond a 5 year old.",

    "question": "Eli5, how does Fractional reserve banking work?...why is it considered the best option for today's banking?",
    "answer": "In fractional reserve banking, a bank is allowed to accept deposits and issue loans. It promises to let depositors withdraw their money when they please, but holds only part of its deposits in reserve in case they actually do. So effectively, by promising people access to more money than it actually holds in cash, a bank can introduce new money into the economy. This increase in liquidity encourages investment and economic growth. The system works so long as not too many people demand their money back at once (a \"run on the bank\").  This is like a Ponzi scheme in that there is a risk your deposit is not covered by cash actually held by the fund, but there's no element of fraud; the bank doesn't lie to you about where the interest it pays comes from or pretend to invest in assets in your name that don't actually exist. And the money it does make comes from real loans.  Governments control the risks of inflation from too much money from bank lending by making laws about how much the bank is required to hold in reserve, and by taking action with a central bank that then influences the lending behavior of other banks. They also create programs to insure deposits up to a certain amount, which eliminates the risk for depositors and thus the need to withdraw their savings if they are unsure about the bank, which also reduces risk for the bank.",

Subscriptions are a way to make people think they are spending less than they are, and for them to never even know how much they are spending. It exploits ego and ignorance and often emotions.  The super simple answer is because they know they can get more money for the same thing because people look at a monthly price as the total cost even if they understand it isn't.

So instead, another protein grabs that acyl group and attaches it to glycine, an amino acid. The resulting acylglycine can be excreted relatively safely in the urine",

    "answer": "Dolby Pro Logic and DTS Neo take anything on only left or only right and send it to left front or right front respectively.  Anything that is on both and in-phase goes to the center channel.  Anything that is on both but out of phase goes to the rear/surround speaker(s).  Anything below the high pass crossover frequency for its respective speaker channel goes to the subwoofer.  Pro Logic II or IIx and Neo:6 just expands that into out of phase but unbalanced so stronger on one side goes to that side only, so out of phase but stronger on left goes to left rear or left side. As to how they choose between side and rear for a 6.1 or 7.1 setup, I don't know for sure. The 6 in Neo:6 might imply that it is only 6.1 and the rear is mono so unbalanced goes to the side.",

    "answer": "So I\u2019m no expert and I\u2019m not sure exactly how age impacts the equation, but I would think that it probably increases recovery time and diminishes gains both intrinsically and as a result of the lost training from increased recovery periods.. that being said, gradually over time a person who practices regular cardio exercise will have more blood in their body, resulting in more visible veins. They will have a lower resting heart rate, and improved energy levels over someone who is more sedentary. They are at greater risk for joint injury, but proper supplements and weight exercise can mitigate these effects. As far as pulmonary health in concerned, if they\u2019re not actively smoking or contributing to worsening their lung health, it should improve health in this regard, even going so far as to reverse some of the harmful effects of past smoking.  At first, the training will be difficult and it\u2019s best to approach it in intervals of run/walk. Over the first month or 2 of consistent practice, this should get to the point where you\u2019re able to run consistently without the need to stop, and all the aforementioned benefits start to kick in. If you\u2019re looking for advice on training to be faster, plyometric workouts and integrating more interval-based training into your schedule are where you would want to look. Otherwise, it can just be something where you go out for a few miles a day and enjoy the leisure of moving freely.  Lastly, the key to any cardio exercise is core strength.

That way you can transmit the single combined signal instead of a bunch of smaller ones individually.   A simple way to do it is called time division multiplexing. Say you\u2019re trying to measure data from two different sensors that take a measurement once every second. They\u2019re far away though, and you don\u2019t want to have to run two different cables to these sensors because cables are expensive. So you just combine the data from the sensors into one signal that\u2019s twice as fast. On the first half of every second you have data from sensor 1, and on the second half of every second you have data from sensor 2. At the receiving end you then just have a demux with two outputs. Output 1 only reads the combined signal on the first half of a second, and output 2 only reads the second half. So output 1 only has data from sensor 1, and output 2 only has data from sensor 2.   So you were able to send one combined signal through just a single wire, but at the end you\u2019ve split it back up into the two original signals you actually want.",

Sounds like the information sources I found are leaving out some important detail about how heat energy works cause this explanation does not compute. Anyone care to fill in the missing info?     Releasing the sweat does not have any cooling effect whatsoever. It needs to evaporate. The vast majority of body heat is lost in the form of evaporation energy. A liquid requires a certain threshold energy - enthalpy - to change into its gaseous form. That's where the body heat disappears.

    "question": "eli5: How does patents work?",
    "answer": "Patents are a way to make sure that if you invent something new, you have the exclusive right to make money off of it for some time. In return, you have to publish all of the details of your invention so that after your time is over, other people can use it, compete with you, and perhaps improve upon it.  To get a patent, you have to make a document that describes your invention in detail. The invention has to meet a lot of criteria, but to oversimplify the patent examiners have to decide your invention looks unique \"enough\". The rules about what that means are pretty complicated, and some people's entire careers are devoted to that!  Once you have the patent, for some number of years you are the ONLY person allowed to make and sell the invention. You can license that right to other people if you want, but the point is YOU control that invention for a time and for someone to use it, they have to have your blessing. The number of years can be different depending on what kind of patent you have. If someone else makes the same thing or even something very similar, you have a right to sue them for patent infringement.   After the period is over, anyone can read your patent document and make the invention and you no longer have the right to sue them. If you want to keep being the only person with that invention, you have to find some way to make a new version worthy of a new patent, but you still can't stop people from making and selling the old one.   This is different from copyrights and trademarks. To compare and contrast with oversimplifications:  * **Copyright** is not something you apply for, it's granted the moment you produce a copyrightable work (typically some kind of art). Other people can't copy your copyrighted material without your permission, though there are some very complicated \"fair use\" laws that allow people to use tiny pieces as long as they follow some rules. It can expire but is typically VERY long term such as 20 years or \"until the author dies\". * **Trademarks** have to be registered and are very specifically limited to images, slogans, songs, and a few other types of art. These are typically used for branding and marketing. They MUST be renewed to remain valid, but there aren't limits to how often you can renew them. There are some weird processes where you can lose your right to claim a trademark, but they're pretty complicated. * **Patents** tend to cover inventions rather than artwork. They must be applied for, and the invention has to be pretty unique to get a patent. You MUST publish enough information to teach someone how it works to get a patent, because the intent is after the patent expires anybody is allowed to make it.  Sometimes someone might choose not to patent an invention and instead just try to keep it secret. For example, consider \"secret formulas\" like the recipe for Coca-Cola. If they had applied for a patent, they would have to publish the recipe and anyone could make an EXACT version of it by now. So instead, they kept it a secret. There are lots of copycat colas on the market now, and Coca-Cola can't sue people for that, but they CAN claim that nobody else has *exactly* the same recipe.",

    "answer": "Ever played Pandemic? The way you win Pandemic is to be *highly* infectious but very low lethality. Then, once the entire world is infected, you buy heart failure.   Reality doesn't work like that - the same mutation doesn't arise simultaneously in all instances of the virus - but the important part, that high infectivity, low lethality viruses are S tier, is true. High infectivity and low lethality allows the virus to propagate and multiply. The more people are infected, the more copies of the virus there are. The more copies of the virus there are, the more opportunities the virus has to develop new mutations.   Omicron will already have mutated a bunch of times. Most of those mutations won't change anything. Some of them will make it less effective. Some of them will make it more infective. Some of them will make it more deadly, meaning it's both high infectivity and high lethality. When that happens (and it is a when, not an if), it'll become the next major variant and it could potentially be worse than the first wave. Basically, the fewer people infected, the less likely new mutations are to emerge. A strain that can infect a lot of people is bad because of the future mutation potential.  There's also a matter of simple maths. Imagine that Delta Covid infects 10,000 people per day and hospitalises 1% of infected. That's 100 new admissions to hospitals per day. Now imagine Omicron has half the hospitalisation rate of Delta, but has three times the infectivity. Omicron infects 30,000 people per day, and hospitalises 0.5% of them. That's 150 new admissions per day. That's worse overall even though Omicron is less lethal individually, because it's infecting so many more people.",

    "answer": "Well fist, consider that over 700,000 people have died from covid. That equates to a lot of dead employees and new job openings.  Second, since covid had many people staying home, they found alternate ways to make money. Now that businesses are opening again, many are finding that they can do better with their side hustle rather than returning back to work.  Third, Employers are desperate for workers, so potential employees are using that to their advantage to try and get employers to pay higher wages. This has happened in the past - workers demanding higher wages - except this time, the people actually have the advantage, due to being in high demand.   From an economic standpoint, look at is as supply and demand or the concept that scarcity increases the value of goods. Under current conditions/pay rates, employees are currently both in high demand and scarce. Many employers aren't giving into the demands (raising wages) so they can't obtain full staffing.

    "question": "ELI5: What does life insurance mean?",
    "answer": "I can help as I have worked in the industry for a while.   The simplest form of life insurance works where an insurance provider will promise to pay a lump sum of money in the event of someone's death. Insurance providers charge a small amount of money for this periodically (the premium) in order to fulfil this promise.   Insurance providers work out how much money to charge by looking at things like life expectancy over large populations of people. They also invest the money they collect. The idea is that they will ultimately collect more money from people that don't die and make more in investment returns from that money than they will have to pay out for people that do die.   Sometimes people have very expensive lives. Think rock stars or football players or business executives. If these people have life insurance and they die, then the insurance provider could lose a lot of money. Instead of turning away the business, insurance providers can lay off some of the risk by getting other insurers to take up a portion of the payment if the high vaule lives were to die. This is called reinsurance.   This answer relates to life (term) insurance, but there are a bunch of other types like trauma, total and permanent disability, income continuity, all of which are offered by life insurance providers. Other products also operate as quasi investment products where even if the insured life doesn't die there is a payout at the end.   Happy to answer any questions about any element of this.",

But what did happen was the Russian military had exercises a couple hundred miles away, on their own territory. Yet we have military exercises near Russian borders all the time.

    "answer": "A Turing machine is a \"state machine\" (also called finite automata) that pilot an head that can move, read and write through an infinite memory.  The tricky part is that all the power of a Turing machine is hidden in the notion of state machine. State machines can make conditional, they can loop, they can do pretty much everything you can imagine doing with algorithms.  Their only true restriction is that they are very limited in memory, and the Turing machine adds that.  Even then, there is still some \"kinds of computations\" that mathematically exists but that a Turing machine can't do. But they're all of the kind \"do this infinitely often THEN after this infinite amount of actions do this other thing\" so not considered physically possible. In particular, I believe that if we invent time travel, there are a few kind of computations that we would be able to do but that Turing machine can't, but I'm not 100% sure on that.  So the thing is, up until know, everything we were able to compute with some real device, we can see the decice as a State machine together with some additional memory, and \"state machine with memory\" can be written as a Turing machine.

For one such example, there is a field that describes the distance in inches everywhere in the universe from a cup of coffee. This field varies as cups of coffee are created, consumed, or moved around. While this may seem contrived, it still meets the criteria to be a \"scalar\" field - a field with a single number at each. One such real field like this is the Higgs Field - related to describing the distribution of mass in the universe.   Fields can also have multiple values at every point, for example in 3d space this could be a direction. The gravitational field is one of these, every point in the universe has some direction that gravity would pull on a small mass at that point. Fields are useful tools because often they can exert forces on the things that interact with them - just how a one mass is pulled towards another because their interactions with the gravitational field.   The magnetic field is just another vector field where the value at each point encodes the direction and strength of the push on an object that interacts with the magnetic field - such as moving charged particles, electric currents, or magnetic objects. When we say that an object has \"a magnetic field\", we mean that this object influences the values at all the points in the magnetic field near the object where a stronger magnet changes the values more.  The magnetic field is especially interesting because its relationship with the electric field, as changes in the magnetic field cause changes in the electric field (the direction/strength of forces on static charged particles) and vice versa, a principle that makes generating electricity possible.",

    "question": "ELI5: why are ponds (closed ecosystems) not as genetically atypical as isolated regions, like the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands?",
    "answer": "I accidentally did a little experiment. I dug a hole in unfertile clay. It filled with water the next time it rained and so I had the pond full of dirty water. A year later it was full of rushes, other plants, and frogs and turtles and all sorts of life and had a visiting heron. There's no way that a pond is genetically isolated.",

    "question": "ELI5: Is water consumed by agriculture destroyed?",
    "answer": "It re-enters the water cycle, but the problem is that the water cycle isn't *guaranteed* to deliver the water exactly back where you took it from.  In general water evaporates from the oceans, forms clouds, rains on the ground, and forms rivers which drain back to the ocean.    We typically suck up huge quantities of water from rivers, and given that weather is somewhat unpredictable and you can have droughts and other adverse weather effects, bottom line the water in that river that feeds several states could dry up.  So planners look at *consumption* and then also at the average amount of rainfall / weather / on average how much of that water may return to that river through natural phenomena.  We can't control the natural phenomena, but we CAN control consumption, so that's why it's measured.",

    "question": "ELI5 Could someone explain to me the Gold standard, how it came to an end and the Bretton Woods System. Also if the value of dollar is tied to value of gold what's the point?",
    "answer": "When you deposited gold in a bank, they would give you a receipt. Trading actual gold coins is difficult, because they're heavy, it's hard to make change etc. so what people started doing was trading was just trading the receipts instead. That's what paper currency was you accepted it as payment knowing you could always go and get the gold if you really wanted it. So they pegged the dollar to gold, at a ratio of $20 per ounce, and well that was that.  The gold standard fell apart after WW1 and WW2 because governments basically committed fraud. They printed more receipts for gold than they had actual gold, and used this counterfeit money to fund the war efforts.   So that fell apart. Bretton Woods was an attempt to sort of patch up the gold standard, while placing America in a very advantageous position. What had happened at the end of WW2 is that America was holding most of everyone's gold, because European countries had sent it to the US for safe keeping. So what the Americans did was establish the dollar as a sort of default one world currency. Every other country would measure their currency against the dollar, and the US government would peg the dollar to the gold they were holding, at a ratio of I think $40 per ounce.  And that fell apart because the US government basically committed fraud. Again. They printed more dollars than they had actual gold, so that $40 ratio did not hold and eventually in 1971 President Nixon just abolished it entirely. Since then every country has sort of pegged their currency to the dollar, but the dollar itself is pegged to nothing.  The point of a gold standard was to keep people honest. If you can legally just print all of the money you want, then you're just going to print and print and print. If anyone else does it they go to jail but it's OK when governments do it, apparently. But if there's a gold standard, it means you have one objective yard stick that we all use, and you cannot spend money you don't use.   It's a nice idea but ultimately it doesn't work because they always print more dollars than they have gold in the vaults to back it up.",

    "question": "Eli5 If you perceive the volume at the same level, what's more harmful to your ears: over ear or in ear headphones?",
    "answer": "From the sound? Neither.  What can damage your eyes is the intensity of the sound energy, or the volume of it.  In ear headphones actually put out less energy, but that energy output is much closer to the ear, making it sound equivalent to over ear headphones that might be putting out more energy, but are further away from the ear.  Sound energy dissipates over distance.  So, if you have the same intensity of sound hitting your ear from each, hypothetically neither should be more damaging than the other.",

    "question": "ELI5 How quickly can germs move from your hands up your arms? Are they like little racecars or snails?",
    "answer": "Germs don't travel like that, not really.  If you touched your fingertip to a bacterial culture and then left your hands and arms fixed in place for a long time, you're forearms wouldn't be contaminated with that bacteria for a long, long time if ever.  The issue is that bacteria and other pathogens become airborne easily (they're really, really small and light - a slight disturbance can make them airborne), so when you \"do something manky\" you've almost certainly had some of the manky germs end up on your forearms (and face and shirt and lots of other places).  Also, you probably touch your arms and face and legs and los of other parts with those manky hands far more and far more often than you realize, spreading germs by direct touch.  When you wash up, you're not trying to remove every trace of germs from every part that may have been exposed, you're just trying to significantly reduce the number of pathogens on the parts of your body most likely to have larger concentration (like hands), which are generally the parts that come into contact with food (if you're a cook), patients (if you're in health care), etc.  Scrubbing up to the elbows is a best practice because it does help reduce pathogens on your hands generally without a significant increase in time and effort - since you're already at the sink washing your hands, it's no big deal to use a bit more soap and scrub up a bit higher.",

    "question": "ELI5 What is universal healthcare?",
    "answer": "Commonly referred to a socialized medicine. Essentialy government run, tax funded single-payer healthcare system.   Most European and lots of asian countries have various spins on this. A familiar example might be Canada. Each province (state) has a provincial healthcare body that runs all of the hospitals, pays for all the doctors, nurses, MRI machines etc. Resources are funded and allocated where the demand is. i.e. a hospital in a growing city gets more doctors and machines and testing labs etc.   So unlike in the US, where healthcare is paid for almost entirely by private healthcare insurance plans, along with huge deductibles where patients have to pay out of pocket, in Canada (for example), you just rock up to the hospital with a broken leg, wait until its your turn, leg gets an x-ray, reset, a cast and you go home. Most you'll have to pay for is parking at the hospital and a drink from the ER vending machine.   The criticism is that for non-critical procedures and injuries, depending on priority you can wait some time for your \"free\" healthcare. Its not uncommon to be in the ER room of a hospital with a broken bone for 3-4 hrs. Its not uncommon to have a several month waitlist for joint replacement surgery. You might have to wait a few days or a few weeks for an MRI or some type of test. But its all done on a priority basis. Mostly. But its free (as in paid for by everyone's taxes).  Comparatively, in the US, you rock up to a hospital and you get an x-ray, pain killers, see a doctor, have a cast set all within an hour. Or if need be, you can have an MRI _today_ if you're willing to pay for it. There's somewhat of an excess of capacity, that's part of the reason its so expensive.",
