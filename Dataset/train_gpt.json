    "question": "ELI5:What is animal instinct ?",
    "answer": "Instincts are complex innate behaviours, reflexes are simple innate behaviours. For instance, when a human baby is dipped underwater, it immediately holds its breath. That's a reflex.  When a sea turtle hatches from its egg, it heads straight for the ocean. That's far more complex than just holding your breath so we consider it instinctual behaviour.  The behaviour of complex living organisms is largely governed by brain chemistry and hormones in particular. When you find yourself in a surprising situation, it's a hormonal response that causes you to feel afraid, aggressive, overjoyed or any other emotion. And your behaviour will result from that.   I'm sure you've heard of the fight or flight response in the face of something scary for instance. Something surprises the organism and the brain immediately gives a response that causes the organism to respond with aggression or fear.  So now that we understand that brain chemistry can determine how an organism behaves. We're also closer to understanding how instinctual behaviour is \"stored\" or passed on from parent to sibling.  Take those hatching sea turtles for instance. Sea turtles immediately head for the ocean by heading towards the brightest patch of the horizon in their field of vision. If they keep doing that, they'll find the quickest route to the water.  There are many possible reactions a baby turtle could take after hatching:  * It could lie still and rest after the exertion of hatching * It could start looking for food to replenish its energy after hatching * It could set off in a random direction * It could follow the scent of water (and risk ending up in the wrong body of water rather than the ocean)  But lots of animals are hanging around for the express purpose of feasting on the hatching baby turtles.  So natural selection means that the lazy turtles, the lost turtles, the wandering turtles are the first to die. And the turtles whose brain chemistry urges them to get moving, to head towards the light on the horizon and to get into the water are the ones that survive the most.  The turtles who survive the most pass on their genes the most. Evolution simply means that for baby turtles, those whose brain chemistry urges them to rush for the ocean fastest are the best young survivors. And over time that means that every single turtle that hatches has the overwhelming desire to race to the water.  That's instinct. And that's how instinct is stored and passed on. They are chemical balances in the brain that produce behaviour that is so beneficial to survival that pretty much every member of a species has it. Because all others die.",

    "answer": "A good rule of thumb is that radio signals either go real far or can carry a lot of data.  When you get low frequency it will go a long long way but can barely carry anything and when you get high frequency it can carry a ton of data but can get stopped by a wall or water in the air or anything.     So the 'best' frequencies are the ones in the middle that can go pretty far and carry pretty much data. But all the radio frequencies kinda got assigned real lazy as new stuff got invented so things like music radio and tv got to take it all, and the military got the rest.      CBRS is a tiny tiny slice of spectrum the navy owned that it is giving to the public which will get used for some combination of wifi and cell phones. Which can have speeds like 5G but not need to do the 5G thing of needing super high power towers every mile.      Basically it's a huge deal but really won't feel like a big deal, cell phones will get vaguely better. But internally it's a way better frequency to be on.",

    "question": "ELI5: What is Machine Learning?",
    "answer": "First of all, there are some similarity between Machine Learning (ML) and stats, there are even some definite overlap, e.g. Linear Regression. Hence, the memes:  https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*x7P7gqjo8k2_bj2rTQWAfg.jpeg  https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1*mXeEWBymq-UXPXF2Oai5mg.jpeg  https://i.redd.it/4f71u8ti5hg31.jpg  What makes things more complicated is that ML is an extremely rapidly growing field, what it IS changes from month to month (usually growing). So it is kinda hard to tell the difference.  So here is my extremely simplified version:  * The purpose of statistics is that so HUMAN can understand the data  * The purpose of ML is to make PREDICTION.  For example, you are a CEO, and sales is down this month. If you want to know why, so you can do something about it, you get a statisticians. If you want to know what is sales for next month, so you know how much stock you have to order, you get an ML expert.  But here is a good example where things get complicated. Explainable AI and causal inference are definitely under ML, although they are supposed to answer the \"why\" question, on top of making prediction. There are also things like clustering, that also attempts to give human insights into the data.  A better explanations is that some tools, like neural network, are born out of the ML field, and regardless of what is used for. It will always be considered as ML, not stats.  ******************  So here's my summary. In the past, everything is stats. Then some people are interested in making predictions using the tools in stats, so ML was simply a subfield of stats. Then a number of ML specific tools (like neural network) were made. So now, anything that uses those tools, are considered as ML, regardless or purpose (e.g. XAI and causal inference). Worse, people are enhancing those ML tools with classical stats tools (e.g. Bayesian + neural network). In those cases, more often than not, the ML labels stick.  (I know this is a bad history, because ML is born out of CS and AI, not stats. But ELI5)  So, the distinction between ML and stats is more like the distinction between a main course and a dessert. It is hard to make hard and fast rule, but you can feel it.",

    "answer": "People can't handle complexity and few can plan for the future. You can give people complex info and they will only see it as a simple problem.   For example ask someone if their salary is $100k a year how long do they have to work to buy a car that sells for $50k. If they say 6 months you have a sucker who can't think outside of very simple frameworks.  People, especially the ones who will tell you they aren't, are not smart and will leave subscriptions active for years after they stop using it.  Subscriptions are a way to make people think they are spending less than they are, and for them to never even know how much they are spending. It exploits ego and ignorance and often emotions.  The super simple answer is because they know they can get more money for the same thing because people look at a monthly price as the total cost even if they understand it isn't. The smaller you can break up a total cost the cheaper it appears. Even if we know that math is a real thing, we don't use it because we're lazy.

    "question": "ELI5:What are \"wrapped coins\" (wEth, wBTC, ...) ?",
    "answer": "Back in the 2017 crypto bull run, bitcoin was really expensive to send around because of the network congestion but sending eth around was super cheap. Since eth allows you to do smart contracts, you can make an eth token called \u201cbitcoin\u201d (or \u201cwrapped bitcoin\u201d so it doesn\u2019t confuse people), and essentially lock up an actual bitcoin in a ethereum smart contract and send around that eth token (called eth wrapped bitcoin) instead.   The real bitcoin is still there, gaining or losing value, but you can send around your eth token and pay minimal eth fees instead of sending around that actual bitcoin.  Fast forward to this bull run and people made jokes how it should be bitocin wrapped eth now (since eth fees got pretty ridiculous). This can\u2019t happen quite yet because bitcoin can\u2019t do smart contracts.  It\u2019s basically a bridge between chains. So you can use any coin on any network.  Edit:  I\u2019m going to add to this because I\u2019m obsessed with crypto and want everyone else to be as well.   You may see tokens like cETH, aUSDC, or CAKE-LP (as opposed to the actual assets: ETH, USDC, or CAKE). These are called proof of ownership tokens. You can look at them like receipts.   For example, let\u2019s say I have some USDC (US dollar coin), and I want to get interest on my USDC. To do this, I deposit them into a lending pool (let\u2019s say I use the Aave protocol). Once they leave my wallet, I get aUSDC (Aave USDC) in return. This is an absolutely amazing and overlooked feature of crypto. This aUSDC I have is just as valuable as the asset itself + any interest it\u2019s generating. If I sent you my aUSDC tokens, you can withdraw all my usdc (and any accrued interest) out of Aave. This allows the usdc holder to not only gain interest in the Aave lending pool but now take that \u201creceipt\u201d and use that value somewhere else to generate even more passive income.   Uhhhg I could go on but then I\u2019ll for sure be treading on waters that are too difficult for 5 year olds if I haven\u2019t already >.<  Dm me if you have any questions!

For instance if you aren't a cannibal, and you don't grow food in fertilizer made from human waste, then the chances of you getting prions in your system is low.

Tiny screens with super high resolution are very profitable in smartphones because people will pay hundreds of dollars for a small panel.  Huge screens with medium resolution are profitable enough to keep one factory making them (LG and Sony use the same plant to make their OLED TV screens), because enough people will pay thousands of dollars for a big OLED screen with 4K resolution.

But, this is a size where people want to pay hundreds of dollars, less than half the smartphone price for a screen that's 20X bigger with 5X more pixels.

An optical disc drive shines a laser at the disc, and how the laser reflects in each microscopic location is used to encode the data. At a disc manufacturing plant, a master is used to stamp or etch physical pits into a disc. But recordable discs use a dye or metal alloy that a higher-energy laser can heat to change the reflectivity.  HDDs use a magnetic platter to record the data. An actuator arm moves to different locations on the spinning disc, and the magnetic polarity of each microscopic sector determines the data.  SSDs store electric charge in NAND flash cells. Effectively it's like a tiny capacitor that traps the charge there. The charge state determines the data.

The short answer to why they claim they can test hundreds of different reactions is they use IgG tests (*not* IgE tests, which are commonly used by allergists), which looks at the relative amounts of IgG antibodies for the foods they test. The theory is if you have a high number of antibodies, you may be sensitive to that food.   They test for the antibodies by exposing the blood to samples of the food, then check and see how many antibodies attached to each food tested.   If I understand correctly, unlike some other blood tests this means you are only using up blood that reacts to the food samples (presumably with some waste), since they will not attach to food they do not react to, and as such you don't have to \"use up\" as much blood",

    "answer": "Boot Camp allows you to install Windows operating system on a Mac computer, alongside Mac OS. This only works on Intel-based Macs because Windows is only compatible with that hardware. Microsoft does not yet make available a consumer version of Windows compatible with Apple's M1 chip. Pro: the OS is running natively on the hardware, making full use of the hardware. Con: a computer can only run one operating system at a time, so you have to reboot to switch between them.  Parallels Desktop is virtualisation software. It creates a pretend computer, within which you can install and run another operating system, like Windows. Pro: you can switch between Mac OS and Windows seamlessly and without rebooting. Con: it's virtualisation, so performance can suffer.  So if you want the Boot Camp experience while using Parallels...just reboot your computer every time you want to run Windows inside Parallels. I don't know why you'd want to do that, but you do you. It will still be virtualised of course, since Windows cannot natively run on the M1, so you still have the performance hit.  CrossOver is completely different software. It implements a compatibility layer to allow Windows apps to run on non-Windows operating systems. Basically when an application runs, it expects certain functionality to be provided by the underlying operating system - drawing a GUI to screen, accessing file, talking to hardware, opening network connections, and much more.  Different OSs mostly provide the same functionality but you need to talk to them in different ways. CrossOver sits between the application and the OS and translates those Windows function calls from the application into something the underlying Linux/Mac/Chrome OS can understand and perform. The reason not all apps works is that compatibility layers are rarely perfect, they are trying to exactly copy all of the functionality provided by an OS which is not fully documented, and will have weird quirks or edge cases, without having access to the source code of the OS.",

    "question": "ELI5: What is the actual purpose of AC power?",
    "answer": "Electric generators and motors can use dc or ac, not both.  DC generators and motors need brushes to catch the power from the spinning part, and this brushes require big big maintenance. When AC was discovered, it allowed to make generators and motors at 2/3 of the price of a DC one, and they are completely maintenance free, because they don\u2019t need a brush system. So they won, and were adopted in mass.  Not having brushes allows to produce higher voltages without issues. Higher voltage allows to  transfer the same power using thinner wires, this makes transport and the generator parts to be done with thin cheaper wires, saving even more money.  Then the power transport in cables has losses along the line, electrons flow heats the cables, with high voltage, you can transport power by moving fewer electrons but with higher force in each of them. So again, another win for high voltage systems, and again high voltage production is easier if done in AC. There are DC high voltage lines, for example, submarine cables and nation to nation lines may be high voltage DC; not so common but it\u2019s done sometime, for example, a country with 115v 50hz AC may transform it to DC to sell it to another country that then transforms it into its own 220V 60hz AC. This is done because the 2 different AC systems are completely incompatible, because both need to transform it, they may have a DC line between them.  Add in that illumination can be done with DC or AC without difference.   Basically the only drawback for AC is computers. Computers need low voltage DC. So we use an AC line for everything, and transform it to low voltage DC only in the devices that need it. Another thing that can\u2019t work in AC are batteries, so any system that has a battery needs to be DC. This doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t do a AC system with a DC conversion between system and battery, sometime it\u2019s done, it\u2019s overly expensive but may be done.",

    "question": "Eli5 what Critical Race Theory is, and why it\u2019s making headlines right now?",
    "answer": "Here you go:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_race_theory  Why is it making headlines? Many schools are revamping their curriculum.  My opinion is that one group wants true history being taught. i.e. slaves were not immigrants. Native Americans were here first. And another group wants to teach American exceptionalism and not teach the negative parts of US history.   Many conservatives claim that Critical Race Theory teaches that all white people are racist and that white people should all feel guilty.   I disagree and think that those ideas are more from the books White Fragility and How to be Anti Racist.   Critical Race Theory is a legal / law school topic. I don\u2019t know anyone that\u2019s being taught this in K-12.   Black History,Native American history and US history should be taught honestly and accurately.   Teaching that all whites are racist and all blacks are oppressed is not productive and not something I can honestly say is occurring. At least not with any parents that I know.  ETA: I also think the 1619 Project by Hannah Nicole Jones has ruffled a lot of feathers. Her article has been challenged by historians and many say it\u2019s flat out historically incorrect. But there are other essays and articles that are part of the 1619 Project that are fact based and accurate. I think some schools say that they were going to start teaching the 1619 Project. I don\u2019t know if they planned to teach some or all of it. But the 1619 project is not critical race theory although some groups describes it as such.",

If you touched your fingertip to a bacterial culture and then left your hands and arms fixed in place for a long time, you're forearms wouldn't be contaminated with that bacteria for a long, long time if ever.  The issue is that bacteria and other pathogens become airborne easily (they're really, really small and light - a slight disturbance can make them airborne), so when you \"do something manky\" you've almost certainly had some of the manky germs end up on your forearms (and face and shirt and lots of other places).  Also, you probably touch your arms and face and legs and los of other parts with those manky hands far more and far more often than you realize, spreading germs by direct touch.  When you wash up, you're not trying to remove every trace of germs from every part that may have been exposed, you're just trying to significantly reduce the number of pathogens on the parts of your body most likely to have larger concentration (like hands), which are generally the parts that come into contact with food (if you're a cook), patients (if you're in health care), etc.  Scrubbing up to the elbows is a best practice because it does help reduce pathogens on your hands generally without a significant increase in time and effort - since you're already at the sink washing your hands, it's no big deal to use a bit more soap and scrub up a bit higher.",

    "question": "ELI5 What are treasury yields and why are investors freaking out over interest rate hikes?",
    "answer": "The US government partly funds itself by issuing bonds (basically a specialized type of loan). Like any loan, they pay interest. For US government bonds issued by the US Treasury, we call this the \"treasury yield\". It's effectively the interest rate you get from loaning money to the US government. These are considered about the safest possible investment so any more risky loan (which is basically all of them) is going to have a higher interest than the treasury yield. If the treasury yield goes up (the government is paying higher interest), that pushes up the interest rate of \\*all\\* loans. It's a signal that investors are concerned that some combination of 1) the stock market might be dropping, so they're putting their money somewhere safer (bonds) and/or 2) investors are worried about inflation and want a higher yield to make up the value they're going to lose to inflation.  Right now it's some of both, hence the investors freaking out. If inflation gets high, investments have to perform better just to stay ahead of inflation, so their value goes down. And if interest rates get high, it gets more expensive to borrow money, which tends to slow the economy down and make everything more expensive.",

What it actually refers to is a combination of pain medicine and sedation medicine that are used to keep people calm and comfortable while they have a breathing tube in.   Second, this \u201ccoma\u201d or state of sedation isn\u2019t done to treat the overdose itself. It is done again to allow for uncomfortable medical interventions such as a breathing tube and possibly cooling (targeted temperature management).  When he overdosed, his breathing became so slow and shallow and he did not get enough oxygen and he could not blow out carbon dioxide. When the heart doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen it will stop beating. When the brain doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen for long enough, it causes brain damage (anoxic brain injury).   CPR is used to circulate blood as we try to restart the heart with medication and/or shocks.  A breathing tube is placed to breath for the patient until they can breath on their own.  When a patient has cardiac/respiratory arrest, they almost always have some amount of brain damage, unless high quality CPR was started immediately. We keep them on ventilators (breathing machine connected to the breathing tube that goes down his throat) because the brain damage means he likely wont be able to breath on his own for a while. In many cases after cardiac arrest we also \u201ccool\u201d the patient. This means bringing down their body temperature low enough that it slows metabolism by brain cells and can possibly reduce long term brain damage.  In the next couple days, they will try turning down the sedation to see if he wakes up and evaluate how his brain is functioning (called a sedation vacation). If he does wake up, they will also try a spontaneous breathing trial- turning the ventilator off briefly to see if he is able to breath on his own.

    "answer": "A recurrence relation is fundamentally a mathematical concept, so you're not going to fully understand it until you put some time in to think about the math. But here's an example of applying one.   Suppose you're cutting a piece of paper. Each time you cut the paper, you take all the pieces and stack them on top of each other, then cut right down the middle.   Now we want a function for the number of pieces of paper produced by c cuts. Intuitively, we know we'll go from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16... pieces of paper. We can therefore jump right to an analytic function: f(c) =2\\^(c-1). However, we can also write the recurrence relation. Each time we cut we double the number of pieces of paper we had before: r(c) = 2\\*r(c-1) for c>0. We also need to specify that we started with 1 piece of paper: r(0)=1.   Both ways of expressing the number of pieces of paper are valid and useful. For my money, the recurrence relation better expresses our intuition. Each cut produces twice as many pieces as the number we had before that cut. A computer is also very good at calculating the recurrence relation because it just means writing a simple function and calling it a bunch of times. This is not to say that a computer should have any trouble with 2\\^(c-1), but there are plenty of recursive expressions that don't have an analytical equivalent (like the Fibonacci sequence), yet they're still easy for computers.

While as a lot of people are correct in commenting for weight, there are a lot of other things ports check.

They perform what are called roadside inspections for violations of the actual vehicle, brake thickness, wipers, lights, tires, tire chains in the Northern states, steering, etc. Port employees can take a driver put of service for any violations.   For the overweight trailer question. The port can instruct you to offload freight but that usually doesn't happen unless you are grossly overweight. Typically you just get a ticket, but they can make you offload to another vehicle if necessary. Coming from a company and area that can pull overlength sets of trailers, we typically \"drop\".

So, when you use an application that uses server-client model, the connection between you and the host is the same as the connections you make with P2P applications. The difference between server-client and P2P, is that on a server-client, the application will try to connect with a central server (that generally runs another appliciation dedicated to answer the requests of the client), while on a P2P, the application doesn't have a central server (there's the hybrid architeture, as well), and the application can act both as a server and as a client.     A) Yes   B) The same way you connect to any site, like reddit.    C) You need to download the torrent file. That file contains the metadata so the torrent application knows where to find seeders, and how the file is structured.    D) I think you are imagining that P2P is like a literal direct connection between your computer and the other person's computer. Any data that you send over the internet will go through many servers until it reaches the destination, \"direct connection\" doesn't mean the data will go from your computer, and only travel by cable without passing by any routers, and servers, it only means that users exchange data between each other, instead of them sending requests to a central server.     A good analogy is thinking of sending a note in class to your friend on the other side of the room.     P2P is when you pass the note to the person next to you, and ask him to pass the note to your friend on the other side of the room. Each person will pass the note to the next person until it reaches your friend.   Client-Server would be the same situation, but imagine that there's a 3rd friend, and for some reason you need him to read the note, and then send the note to the friend on the other side of the room. So, in this case, you ask the person next to you to send the note to that 3rd friend, instead of asking him to pass to the original friend.",

So when you lag you're playing just as if you were blind, every hit that happens is just a coincidence as you can't know where the other player actually is according to the server.  And the other, non lagging player receives your real position so he can hit what looks like air to you but is where you are according to the server.  The server decides where you truly are.

Lots of people will wait for their money to be able to buy more. For everyone who waits, that's a TV not being sold.  Now apply that to all products and services, and you can see how it becomes a massive disruption to businesses when people have an active incentive to *not* buy things.

But once any part of you is consciously aware of the fact that you are sleeping, it becomes much more difficult to remain asleep. At that point any aggressive change in the status quo of the dream is likely to jar you awake.

In a diesel engine, though, even if you let off the gas pedal, the engine will still draw a full charge of air into the cylinders, and that air acts as a spring; because the engine is still turning, it's still compressing the air, and the air then rebounds when the piston falls back down.

This blue is then reflected back to my eyes, causing me to perceive the object as blue.  If I get that fabric wet with water, it's much harder for the object to reflect light back towards me. This is because water ALSO reflects light; you can see this when the sun blinds you reflecting off the ocean or a lake. If the fabric is soaked, some of the blue light that should be reflected towards my eyes is instead reflected back into the fabric. This is called \"total internal reflection.\"  If I'm getting less light reflected back to my eyes, I perceive an object as darker.",

They can turn it on or off in the settings. If you DM someone, leave the server, and don't have any mutual servers, you can not DM that person.   You can send a friend request with the \"Add Friend\" button and entering the username and the user's discriminator with the following format:   <username>#<tag>   They must accept the request. Once you friend someone, no matter if they share a mutual server or not, you can DM with him.    Verified Discord servers mean that Discord officially verifies it. It is not very common of course, as you have to apply for verifying your server.   You can create your own server for free, and invite people with the \"Invite people\" button.

    "answer": "Incorrect!   The prefix post- doesn't mean \"rejection of\" in labelling these kinds of philosophical and artistic movements, but rather more \"acceptance of and progression from.\" So post-modernism is an acceptance of and progression from some of the things you attribute to it here.  To understand modernity and modernism as a broad ideology, it helps to consider the early 20thC context, where colonial atrocities and the horrors of WWI were starting to be hard to ignore for intellectuals. Modernists were intrinsically disillusioned by the old grand truths (or metanarratives) of the Western world: War is honourable. Religion is Civilization. Science is Progress. Modernists skewed nihilist. They sought to represent reality with granular truth, not grand truth, in formally innovative ways, and if the outcome was against moralistic messages of the past, so be it.  Post-modernism came about not as a rejection of this, but more as an acceptance that our structures and metanarratives, however illusionary,  are how we create meaning. They just tend to approach these grand institutions ironically (think a screenprinted soup can on an art gallery's wall: it's not denying cultural values, it's just trying to re-evaluate them in interesting ways. Or a Tarantino film that uses a generic Western franchise in homage, but also to discuss race by revising history). So where modernism was dismissive of grand narratives (like the American Dream), post-modernism is generally more playful. A lot of what we call post-modern is actually just modern, mind you.",

Aka, your heart will be better at circulating blood if it's in good shape, thus allowing more blood to get to \"injured\" places in the body, thus healing them faster.  Also, increased exercise causes decreased fat in the body. Fat clogs arteries making blood flow slower. Your body also has to work harder in general to support the extra weight. So, decrease your fat and you'll increase your performance in all areas.  Here's an example. Let's say your liver is damaged. It needs 100 blood cells per hour to heal. Your heart is only able to deliver 75 per hour because it's weak. On top of that you have fat, restricting blood flow, so that 75 cells goes down to 50. It will now take your liver twice as long to heal than if your heart was strong and you had less fat.",

    "answer": "Because the more data that can be collected about you, the more \"they\" know about you; who you are, your age, what you like, where you go, when you get paid and most importantly, what keeps you looking at a screen.  Why do they want you to look at a screen? You may ask.  Advertising.  Companies want to make money, and in order to do this they need to let people know about their products. But advertising your products costs a lot of money when you are trying to reach a wider audience.  So they target specific demographics.  Where before, they would've advertised on a certain website, or in a certain area, advertisers can now target specific people. People they know like the kind of things they are selling. People of a particular age and gender who like to purchase products similar to yours.  By targeting more specifically, they have more chance of making a sale per dollar spent on advertising. So companies who harvest data from us sell it to 3rd party advertisers. And with the amount of people putting their entire lives online, and the amount of money that can be made from selling stuff to them, means it's a big money business.  Then there's the illegal side of the industry.  Your private data, such as passwords and credit card details, the kind of stuff that is kept hidden (or encrypted) online, is very valuable to cyber criminals who can buy such data on the dark web. They may want phone numbers or email addresses to try and scam through phishing emails etc. Or buy credit card details to commit fraud.

Around 1,000ppm is where harms to health begin, and exposure to 30,000 and above is generally only allowed for short intervals.  In EL5: Carbon dioxide builds up in blood as a byproduct of your body and cells working.  This \"waste\" from your cells actually turns your blood acidic and the gas needs to be removed before it begins to damage fragile organs, which is done in your lungs every time your breathe. Your lungs *really* like to exchange CO2 between your blood and the air, which is usually a good thing when you have a lot of carbon dioxide in your blood and little in the air. However, as the air you inhale becomes more saturated with CO2, your lungs will actually work \"backwards\" to move carbon dioxide from the *air into your blood.* This likely comes down to the fact that human lungs have evolved to expect atmospheric CO2 at <500ppm concentrations, so its never been an evolutionary advantage to figure out how to do that.   Plants, by contrast, use atmospheric carbon as a sort of \"fuel\" during photosynthesis - not producing it as waste - so have no such issue with a buildup of concentration.",

    "question": "eli5 why does inflation happen? Isn't the cause of inflation well understood? And doesn't everyone agree it's a bad thing to allow?",
    "answer": "Inflation is a \"market\" thing.  Prices aren't (usually) set by some entity. For something like an electronic component, the company that makes it decides what to sell it for. Companies that make things like TVs decide what to sell the TVs for. They want that price to be higher than the cost of the stuff they bought to make it. They also pay attention to what their competitors are charging and want their price to be below their competitors', unless they think they have a better offering.   If the company wants to make more money, or if they think the costs of making the TV are going to go up, they raise their price. If it's true the costs of their materials went up, it's likely their competitors' prices are going up too. If their competitors see their prices go up even when materials aren't going up, their competitors might raise their prices to match. Or, if the store that sells the TVs wants more money, they might raise the price they sell the TVs for so they make a little more profit.   The only way to truly stop inflation is for the government to set the price for *everything*, but that creates a lot of other economic problems. Instead, we prefer for the government to take indirect actions like changing the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the government. That changes how banks issue loans, which changes how people invest, which can tighten or loosen a lot of purse strings that ripple through the economy.",

Humans have larger brains than other apes and so our snouts are less pronounced than chimpanzees; a typical human skull was also maybe 8in long at the toothline, but closer to 7in at the eyeline.  I say \"was\" because the human jaw doesn't grow correctly unless children are given solid foods to chew.  The reliance on cereals (oatmeal, rice, flour, etc.) as a calorie source, and to a lesser extent the invention of baby food to prevent choking deaths, has resulted in almost everyone--at least in rich Western countries--having severely deformed faces.  (For example, I grew up in a middle-class family in the United States and so my forehead is directly above my teeth: my head is about 7in long at the eyeline--normal human size--but also 7in at the toothline.  98% of the people I meet are the same: flat-muzzled.

The problem is sufficiently hard that we're not seeing too many new elements being created. All the low hanging fruit has been picked.

    "answer": "The one of the most important things to think about when designing a prosthetic (after safety) is how you are going to control it. It might initially seem like, \"we have things like bluetooth, so why is this hard?\" but think about where that signal is coming from in the first place. One of the simplest ways we did prosthetics was by coupling it to motion of another joint. For instance, if you raise your shoulder, your hand closes. Lower your shoulder again and it opens. Obviously, this is very mechanical.   For more advanced methods, we can look at the nerves in your arm. There are three main nerves, but each of these give off branches to different muscles, and we aren't skilled enough to directly measure signals going directly to all ~25 muscles in the forearm and hand. One thing we can do, though, is cheat. Instead of looking for a small nerve, we can put a chip in the region of your brain that sends signals to the hand. The problem here is that we still can't pinpoint a signal. We can train you to use it better, but it is like learning to walk all over again... with the extra difficulty of your muscles don't work properly.  So what is the absolute easiest way to deal with all of these problems? Simple - limit the function of the hand. While we can't get each nerve signal, we can measure signals in the larger nerves. Your hand wont have the dexterity of a slight-of-hand artist, but we can restore *some* of the lost function, which is preferable to none.",

    "answer": "You hear your voice differently because of sound reverberating through your bones and being picked up by your ears through your skull.   When you\u2019re singing, you are trying to hit a specific note. You know you\u2019re on because you hear the note being played, then you harmonize with that note that you\u2019re hearing with your voice. Your ear can be trained to hear harmony and what is called \u201cintervals\u201d (the distance between 2 notes). Practicing pitch matching with your voice and practicing interval matching will train you to both hear what a harmony is supposed to sound like and feel what you need to do in your stomach/throat to match that sound. Then, when you do it on your own, you just mimic those feelings to produce the notes.",

    "answer": "If you're only interested in *air quality...* Sure, humans could potentially survive in 5,000ppm CO2, but there would be pretty profound physiological and cognitive impacts to that long-term.  Around 1,000ppm is where harms to health begin, and exposure to 30,000 and above is generally only allowed for short intervals.  In EL5: Carbon dioxide builds up in blood as a byproduct of your body and cells working.  This \"waste\" from your cells actually turns your blood acidic and the gas needs to be removed before it begins to damage fragile organs, which is done in your lungs every time your breathe. Your lungs *really* like to exchange CO2 between your blood and the air, which is usually a good thing when you have a lot of carbon dioxide in your blood and little in the air. However, as the air you inhale becomes more saturated with CO2, your lungs will actually work \"backwards\" to move carbon dioxide from the *air into your blood.* This likely comes down to the fact that human lungs have evolved to expect atmospheric CO2 at <500ppm concentrations, so its never been an evolutionary advantage to figure out how to do that.   Plants, by contrast, use atmospheric carbon as a sort of \"fuel\" during photosynthesis - not producing it as waste - so have no such issue with a buildup of concentration.",

Conveniently, most televisions had the ability to connect an external antenna in the back. All your device had to do was convert the desired composite video into an NTSC broadcast signal with appropriate levels, and feed it into an antenna cable, which you wired directly to your television.

If a lead acid gets a puncture, there's a leak that can cause chemical burns if mishandled.  Lead acid batteries last a few years in a vehicle. Given the cost of repairs in other parts of the vehicle, the lifespan of some vehicles, and the low cost of occasionally topping up the battery until it needs complete replacing, having a lead acid vs lipo isn't that big a deal.   Others have already mentioned how lipos struggle at low temps, but high temps are a big issue too. The battery needs to output a kilowatt for a few seconds, to crank the engine, which for a lead acid warms it slightly but no big deal, but for a Lipo, that would bring it to a really high temp. Lipos at high temp are more prone to exploding. So starting an older engine that needs cranking longer than few seconds is rolling the dice.  All this given in mind, lead acids are the best of a bad bunch. The only other work around is using a Lipo as a battery bank, and a super capacitor bank to crank the engine, which solves the high output when cranking. Then adding heating and cooling elements to the battery case to solve the low and high temps during use. Then specially designing a lipo and it's case to make sure during a crash it doesn't explode.  At that point though you've massively increased the cost to install the lipo effectively, making it's use as a battery crank overkill, or go with it and make a hybrid or electric car. Might as well just use a generic lead acid and forget about it.",

You're not pulling on the tether ball or hitting it with a bat to give it some more energy, you're putting it on the barrel of a battleship gun and shooting it point blank.

    "answer": "Beekeeper checking in - queens are produced from the same egg as workers.  The egg selected to be a future queen is fed more royal jelly which changes her physiology when she is developing.  Once born, she will battle any other queens to the death.  She then matures for about a week, then flies off for mating.  She typically mates with 15-25 drones.  After returning to the hive she will start laying eggs within a week or so.  At here peak she will lay approx 1,500 eggs per day.    Workers are all female, but do not typically lay eggs.  They have different types of roles in the hive based on age. In rare instances they will lay eggs, but since they never mated, the eggs are all male.  Drones are males with no father, but a grandfather.  They do no work to improve the hive.  Their only function is to spread the genetics of the hive.  They are driven put of the hive in the late fall since they have no value at that point.  Honey is nectar that is collected, concentrated and processed with enzymes.  A forager bee brings the honey into the hive and passes it to another worker.  They then store it into a comb.  During this time enzymes in the bee start processing the honey.  Once stored the comb is left open until the concentration of water drops to around 17% and then it is capped.

    "question": "ELI5: Why are we attracted to people's butts?",
    "answer": "Seems to be a combination of biology and beauty standards. Biology underpins perceptions of beauty, in the sense that what we find attractive tends to be what's good for reproduction, which is mostly health: clear, smooth skin means no diseases that cause skin blemishes. Long, silky hair means no diseases that damage hair growth. Nice arse means the person isn't malnourished.   Then on top of that you get cultural beauty standards. We form more specific details of what we find attractive by what culture tells us is attractive. Of course Freud is famous for his idea that everyone wants to fuck their own mothers. That was incorrect, but it touches on the correct idea that different cultures find different things attractive. For example, some but not all cultures find pale skin a sign of beauty, which isn't grounded in biology. A particular difference is noted in the difference between male beauty standards across the world. Europe and America tends to like big strong somewhat rugged men, but East Asia tends to prefer their men be boyish and pretty in a way we in the west might normally associate with women - cute, almost.

Now in this scenario, I got that $500,000 from some illegal activity but I'm claiming it's from a perfectly legal art sale, and it's very difficult to prove that it isn't legit.

They can be integers, rational numbers like 1/2 or 5/11, or even irrational numbers like pi or the square root of 2. Most functions that people use in real life take in a real number and give you back a different real number.  However, there are also things called complex numbers. These numbers have a real part, and an imaginary part. This is just a different kind of number. A laplace transform turns a function with a real variable into a function with a complex variable. These functions won't be the same, but you can go back and forth from real to complex then back to real.

    "answer": ">So what the heck is the other ingredient causing hangover, and why does nobody talk about it?  There's some biochemistry to be known here. Whenever you ingest something by mouth, the first place it goes after the intestines is the liver, the major center for *metabolism*, or breaking down of chemicals, in the body.  The body wants things to be as simple as possible so they can be flushed out. In the liver, alcohol, or more precisely *ethanol* is attacked by the enzyme *alcohol dehydrogenase* -- \"alcohol,\" referring to the type of chemical it attacks, \"dehydrogen-\" for what it does (literally pulling a hydrogen away from something), and the \"-ase\" ending denoting an enzyme.  So ethanol binds to the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, which pulls off the hydrogen at the end of the molecule, converting it into something called *acetaldehyde*, which is then kicked into the body and allowed to circulate.  It's that chemical, acetaldehyde, which is the other contributing cause of hangover.

Tiny screens with super high resolution are very profitable in smartphones because people will pay hundreds of dollars for a small panel.  Huge screens with medium resolution are profitable enough to keep one factory making them (LG and Sony use the same plant to make their OLED TV screens), because enough people will pay thousands of dollars for a big OLED screen with 4K resolution.

But, this is a size where people want to pay hundreds of dollars, less than half the smartphone price for a screen that's 20X bigger with 5X more pixels.

    "answer": "Disclaimer that I'm not an optomotrist/neurologist so happy to be corrected.  The first important thing to note is that this answer will depend on how far away the screen is, and the size of the screen. If you hold most screens up to your eye, even an incredibly high resolution screen, you will probably be able to make out individual pixels. But if you are looking at a screen from a significant distance, you will struggle to tell any difference in resolution between them. This is because the smallest object your eye can perceive does _not_ depend on the actual size of the object, but rather what proportion of your field of view that object makes up.   A [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity) referenced by Wikipedia gives the maximum *angular* resolution of the human eye (with no visual defects and good lighting) as 0.008 degrees. If we take this value to be accurate, and assume you are looking at a screen 1m away, this corresponds to a pixel size of approximately 0.14mm.   For a 27\" 16:9 monitor, this means that the maximum resolution you could make out (at a viewing distance of 1m) is around 4300x2400, which is a bit more than 4K. The larger the monitor and nearer it is to your screen, the higher the resolution you'll be able to distinguish.",

    "answer": "Any system have angular momentum, around a pivot of choice. Spin is just angular momentum of a particle when considered alone.  Angular momentum are *not* the L=r x v from classical Newtonian mechanics. Instead, we define angular momentum by their main defining characteristic: it is preserved under all continuous rotations. The classical Newtonian angular momentum is a formula that give you a preserved quantity, assuming Newtonian physics is correct. But once we move into the weirder realm of quantum mechanics, we have to abandon the formula and stick with the most important property, the fact that it's preserved under continuous rotations.  Given an arbitrary axis (this axis is normally named z), we can talk about angular momentum around this axis. This is a measurable number that is preserved under all continuous rotations around that axis. Due to funky issue with quantum physics, you can't actually talk about angular momentum around all axis at the same time, because trying to measure this number around one axis disrupt the rest; in fact it's not even possible to talk angular momentum about 2 axes at the same time. However, you can talk about magnitude squared of total angular momentum (when you consider rotation around ALL axis), which IS a number that can be measured.  Without loss of generality, we can assume that we do have a special z-axis where angular momentum exist, because this allows us to have an additional number to identify an electron: the secondary spin number.  If you consider one single particle by itself, this angular momentum give you the spin number, and the angular momentum around one specific z-axis give you the secondary spin number. For an electron, the spin number is fixed to be 1/2, so really you only care about secondary spin number. If you assume that there exist angular momentum around the z-axis, this 1/2 spin number - which tell you angular momentum - limit the possible value of angular momentum around the z-axis. By choosing 1 direction to be called \"up\" (associated with positive number) and the other direction \"down\", we have 2 values +1/2 and -1/2. But warning: this \"up\" and \"down\" don't have any actual geometric meaning, they are merely analogy from classical Newtonian mechanics where angular momentum is represented by a vector that can actually point up or down.  When you consider an atom together with an electron, the whole system itself have a different number that are also angular momentum (of the system). This is called total angular momentum. The electron, when considered alone, have its own angular momentum which is called spin. Subtracting the spin number from the total angular momentum give you orbital angular momentum. Since electron all have the same spin number, you only need orbital angular momentum and secondary spin number if you want to distinguish electrons by angular momentum.",

    "answer": "Seems to be a combination of biology and beauty standards. Biology underpins perceptions of beauty, in the sense that what we find attractive tends to be what's good for reproduction, which is mostly health: clear, smooth skin means no diseases that cause skin blemishes. Long, silky hair means no diseases that damage hair growth. Nice arse means the person isn't malnourished.   Then on top of that you get cultural beauty standards. We form more specific details of what we find attractive by what culture tells us is attractive. Of course Freud is famous for his idea that everyone wants to fuck their own mothers. That was incorrect, but it touches on the correct idea that different cultures find different things attractive. For example, some but not all cultures find pale skin a sign of beauty, which isn't grounded in biology. A particular difference is noted in the difference between male beauty standards across the world. Europe and America tends to like big strong somewhat rugged men, but East Asia tends to prefer their men be boyish and pretty in a way we in the west might normally associate with women - cute, almost.

    "question": "ELI5: Why do concert pianists need music notes to play but guitarists can do everything by memory?",
    "answer": "Some people are better at memorising than others. Also, some people are better at reading sheet music than others. Personally, I find it much easier to read sheet music quickly than to memorise pieces.  Some classical musicians absolutely can memorise long and complicated pieces of music. However, it can be useful to have the sheet music in front of you just in case, even if you don't need to read it. For many classical musicians, the sheet music acts more like a quick memory jogger to remember what the next section is, so that you can then pour your effort into playing that as expressively as necessary.  There are definitely some instruments that are more difficult than others, but this can be for a variety of reasons. As a flautist, I can only play one note at a time, so it's arguably a much simpler instrument than piano or any stringed instrument. At the same time, I don't have as much option for relying on muscle memory. On the piano, you can get used to the way your hands move to play a phrase, and the same for guitar - but on the flute, there's not the same \"easy\" muscle memory for being able to play the next phrase without thinking about. (I'm sure a better flautist than I am might disagree with me about this, but I struggled with the muscle memory for playing phrases on the flute much more than I ever did with the keyboard, guitar, or drums.) As a result, the sheet music can be quite helpful as an aid when the muscle memory isn't as well developed for playing a piece.  Finally, it might just be down to convention and habit. Classical musicians almost always have their sheet music handy, so they almost always put it in front of them. Guitarists often practise without sheet music, so they don't feel as much need to put it in front of them.",

    "answer": "Forgive me if any of this is off, I took the applicable courses for this like 20 years ago, so probably don't remember everything. But in essence:   Metabolism is the process by which your body converts what you eat and drink into energy. Calories are combined with oxygen to release the energy your body needs to function. You burn calories even while at rest, in order to supply the energy your body needs. The number of calories your body uses to carry out these basic functions is known as your basal metabolic rate. In addition to your basal metabolic rate, two other factors determine how many calories your body burns each day (Food processing (thermogenesis) and Physical activity). A portion of calories not burned through these processes is converted into glycogens (sugar essentially), which are easily accessed and metabolised first. The rest are stored by your body in the form of fat, which is retained to supply energy when there aren't enough other nutrients available.  The weight of calorie dense foods does not translate into the amount of weight gained. That weight is determined by the amount of extra calories stored by your body. To translate this into numbers, each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories. The human body needs to burn about 4100 calories to burn that lbs of fat, which will only happen if there are no other easily accessible calories (like glycogens) available.  So, if you consume something calorie dense that exceeds the number of calories your body needs to function, the rest will be stored as fat. Do this often enough, and you'll gain weight.",

Let's say you have a $100k tractor to plant corn. If you plant 1000 stalks of corn, the cost of that tractor is allocated as $100k/1000 units, or $100/unit. If you plant 1 million stalks, your cost per unit shrinks to $0.10/unit in terms of operating that tractor, presuming you have the land to do it already and all else stays equal with the tractor.

    "answer": "It really depends upon the organism being bacteria or virus.  Nobody knows how long Covid-19 vaccines will offer immunity, yet.  Also different vaccines will vary.  Chicken Pox vaccine (varicella) lasts \\~40-50 years, then immunity lessens, that's why there is a Shingles vaccine for elders.  Measles last your lifetime.  Tetanus should be re-vaccinated every 6-10 years.  The yearly flu (influenza) lasts only about a year, but not because the immune system weakens, it's because the virus changes and the body no longer recognizes it.  Vaccines or the natural infection itself (such as chicken pox) give the same immunity.  With chicken pox whose immunity lasts about 40 years, it is the immune system getting weaker.  With influenza, it's \"I don't recognize this enemy.\"  With Tetanus it's \"I forgot how to fight this.\"  Not all mutations are bad.  Back around 2009 the \"swine flu\" hit the world, another pandemic, but the virus mutated so much that it pretty much was no longer a big issue.  Unfortunately Covid-19 is not being so polite, but it also could mutate into a friendlier form, or as you've heard a \"worse\" one.  In this case it's not more harmful, it simply spreads easier.

    "answer": "Keep in mind that P2P is an architeture that is implemented at application level, so only the app knows that it is P2P, how the connection is made isn't changed. So, when you use an application that uses server-client model, the connection between you and the host is the same as the connections you make with P2P applications. The difference between server-client and P2P, is that on a server-client, the application will try to connect with a central server (that generally runs another appliciation dedicated to answer the requests of the client), while on a P2P, the application doesn't have a central server (there's the hybrid architeture, as well), and the application can act both as a server and as a client.     A) Yes   B) The same way you connect to any site, like reddit.    C) You need to download the torrent file. That file contains the metadata so the torrent application knows where to find seeders, and how the file is structured.    D) I think you are imagining that P2P is like a literal direct connection between your computer and the other person's computer. Any data that you send over the internet will go through many servers until it reaches the destination, \"direct connection\" doesn't mean the data will go from your computer, and only travel by cable without passing by any routers, and servers, it only means that users exchange data between each other, instead of them sending requests to a central server.     A good analogy is thinking of sending a note in class to your friend on the other side of the room.     P2P is when you pass the note to the person next to you, and ask him to pass the note to your friend on the other side of the room. Each person will pass the note to the next person until it reaches your friend.   Client-Server would be the same situation, but imagine that there's a 3rd friend, and for some reason you need him to read the note, and then send the note to the friend on the other side of the room.

    "question": "ELI5 how does the IRS \"wash rule\" work?",
    "answer": "Put simply, the wash sale rule prohibits an investor from claiming a capital loss for tax purposes if they repurchase the stock or security within 30 days.1  Specifically, the IRS deems a transaction a wash sale if the investor does the following 30 days before or after a sale:  1. Purchases the same investment 2. Purchases a substantially similar investment 3. Enters into a contract to buy a similar investment 4. Acquires a similar stock for an IRA or Roth IRA  An Example  Imagine an investor unfortunate enough to purchase Lucent Technology stock when it was trading upwards of $70 per share. Over subsequent years before the firm disappeared through mergers and acquisitions, that investor watched accounting scandals, financial trouble, and sales meltdowns wipe the share price down to $1.3  Ever the enterprising baron, our investor realizes that if they sell their shares, they can report a capital loss and lower their tax burden. The problem? They believe that Lucent, or the firm that ultimately owns it, will rise from the ashes and return some of the market value which it has lost.  Suddenly, our investor gets a brilliant idea. During the last week of December, they call their broker with instructions to sell their shares in the telecom equipment supplier, locking in the capital loss. Three weeks later, during the first half of January, they ask their broker to repurchase those shares of Lucent. All is well in the world; they locked in the capital loss while holding onto the shares. Seems ingenious, right?  The wash sale rule, as you remember, does not allow an investor to claim a capital loss if they repurchase the investment within 30 days. In other words, unless the investor waits until the 30-day period has elapsed, they will not be able to write the off the loss.  There are ways around this, but let us assume the guy in the article didn't do that.  He sells his shares down at $1 in December, buys them back in the next year at nearly the same price, and the stock goes back up.  His 2019 taxes say he lost $5,000,000 and he got an $800,000 tax break, but in 2020, they went up to a total of $5,045,000 ($45,000 profit), but he gets penalized for the wash sale, and has to pay back the $800,000",

But if it is actual Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, the shares cease to exist after everything is said and done, as there is no more company afterwards.  One good example of this was Hertz. It was believed last year that Hertz was going to go into Chapter 7 bankruptcy. However, Hertz had more assets than it did debt, if everything went perfect for Hertz then they would have had 2 dollars per share left after all was said and done, and this would have been distributed to shareholders.  When people realized this, Hertz's stock spiked from the 50 cents it was worth, because after all it was believed that if you bought a share for say 1 dollar and after liquidation you would have gotten 2 dollars from the remaining assets, it would have been profitable even if the share ceased to exist afterwards.  In the vast majority of cases, Ch 7 bankruptcy happens when a company has more debt than assets though. In that case, creditors get first dibs on any asset proceeds and shareholders get last dibs, which means they get nothing usually, and stock goes to 0 since no one is willing to buy worthless shares.",

    "answer": "Data is always just a (binary) number. A long string of 1s and 0s  To encrypt it you create a second, random looking number of the same length and then apply the XOR function on both. (Wich basically flips each bit of the original if the corresponding bit of the random number is 1)  So to undo that you need the encrypted data and the same random number. Just apply XOR again to flip the correct bits back.  XOR(A, B) = C -> XOR(C, B) = A  This number isn't truly random. It's generated by an algorithm from a password (or Key). The same key always generates the same random number, but the random number can't be transformed back to the password.",

If we take WW2 as an example the French surrendered to the Germans after taking very little casualties compared to how large their military was.  The Germans out outmaneuvered the French and got behind them and at this point the French knew that they could either pull back and let even more German troops invade France or stay put and hold those troops off but let the Germans who had got past them run all over France.  Realising that all they had left were bad choices they surrendered.  Germany got what they wanted which was getting the French out of the war and having a rather large say in what France now did.  On paper the French should have won.  They had the more powerful military.  A state of war exists when a country declares war on another.

But yes, to a good extent our offspring can only develop, grow and mature so far within the confines of a grown adult. Despite one instance of a four year old getting pregnant and having a child at age five, generally there\u2019s a far higher survival rate for child and mother if they grow and mature to be capable of reproducing later while the child survival rate is also greater with parents who are older and more capable.

    "answer": "One common method was [Clutch-Brake steering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_steering#Clutch-brake).  Modern tanks will be a bit fancier but the general theory is the same  For a Clutch-Brake system, power goes to the differential which tries to split the power between the two sides.  If you want to turn left you engage either the wheel or a lever that at first just opens the clutch to the left side track so only the right side is powered and moving faster but the left is free spinning and this will cause the tank to turn to the left.  If you need to turn really sharply you keep turning/pulling the lever and the brakes are applied to the left track so its now at a dead stop and only the right track is being powered this lets the tank make very sharp turns.

    "answer": "Air resistance (or *drag*) goes up quadratically with speed. That is, if you double your speed, the drag quadruples. At lower speeds, air resistance is less of a factor. Buses, at least on urban routes, don't go very fast, so they don't experience as much drag as a car might have to deal with.   In addition, drag strongly depends on your cross-sectional area. Now, buses have a much larger cross-sectional area than cars, so you might think that's bad for them. But their advantage is that they are very long. So, compared to their volume, and their capacity to move people, they actually have a rather small cross section.   You also have to consider why you want a (road) vehicle to be aerodynamic. Mainly this is to improve fuel economy. But fuel economy is really best thought of in terms of liters (or gallons) *per passenger* per kilometer (or per mile). Your car might get more miles per gallon than a bus, sure, but that bus is moving many more people for each mile that it travels. People who, if they were all driving cars, would burn a whole lot more fuel.   So in short, buses need to be designed to carry as many people as possible. That's where they achieve their gains compared to cars. Making the bus more aerodynamic isn't going to help very much with that, especially for buses that drive mostly on urban routes. In fact, your aerodynamic improvements might even make the bus' performance worse on the whole, if it means less room for passengers.",

Instead, water causes refraction.....when light hits water it slows down, this slow down changes the direction light is traveling.    In the case of a pool, the surface often has some waves to it...even if they're really tiny waves and it looks completely still it's likely still moving to some degree. This movement causes light to constantly be drawn in different directions as it passes through the surface of the water. This constantly changing direction of light acts almost like a disco ball, causing high and low amounts of light to hit different parts of the floor at the same time, which causes dark and light spots to appear, creating \"shadows\".

    "answer": "There's a lot of hardware that you'll pass through, and most of it you have no way of even knowing.  You can only find out *approximately* how many routers your packet touches on the way to its destination because of a fancy hack of setting the TTL to various incrementing values(which decrements with each router until it reaches 0 to prevent routing loops), and getting TTL Expiry messages back from the router that sent them.  However, that doesn't even tell you the number of routers, since technologies like MPLS let a service provider create a pseudo-routing-shortcut through their network from one edge to another, which can bypass the TTL mechanism in the intermediary steps.  Then you have various switches and signal boosters along the way, which are also going to be transparent.   At the same time, you could be going through \"virtual\" devices. You could have a packet go into a Layer 3 Switch on one Virtual LAN (VLAN), which passes between two Layer 3 Routers within the switch, and then out another VLAN on the switch.

    "answer": "Fish do swallow water when they open their mouth. Like most animals fish can and do drink water and it is filtered through their body much in the same way humans do.  Fresh water fish also absorb water through their skin. This happens because the salt content inside the fish's body is higher than the water they live in. Through osmosis they absorb the water. As a result freshwater fish do not have much need to intentionally \"drink\" for the sake of gaining water, it also means their kidneys are always producing  urine which leads to needing to pee. A lot.   Saltwater fish on the other hand lose more water through their skin than they absorb for the opposite reason that freshwater fish gain water. The salt content of the ocean is higher than what's inside their body so water in their body flows out. This means a couple of things 1) Saltwater fish need to intentionally drink a lot water since they are constantly losing their body's water. 2) since they are constantly losing water they have significantly less need to urinate than their freshwater brothers and sisters. 3) comically - saltwater fish are very commonly internally dehydrated...

    "answer": "There would be no way to route traffic efficiently without IP addressing.  The only way it's done efficiently is by knowing based on network address where to route your traffic.  Think of it more like sending something in the mail, vs a phone book.  You need multiple pieces of information to get it to the right place right?  You need Zip Code (US), State, City, Street Address, and Person.  You mail that piece of mail from one side of the US to another, the first thing they do is look at that information to determine how it's going to get to it's destination.  You can't just put a name on there, as there is no way for the mail service to know that name out of the 300 million people living in the US.  So they start with ZIP code (which is really smaller than state), then narrow it down by street address, then eventually when it gets into your mailbox your wife hands you the mail because it ends up with your name on it.  Same way IPs work.  The numbers are not just randomly assigned.  Network address space is reserved by classes.  And routing tables know where those addresses are assigned to.  We know that everything 8.x.x.x is going somewhere, and everything that 9.x.x.x is going somewhere.  Then, as it gets closer to the destination, we use the additional digits to pinpoint where it's going until we get to the last digit and then we have the server.  Also, its VERY important to know, that name does not equal 1 server or IP address.  For example, when you go to [google.com](https://google.com) you go to 10000s of servers, not just a single server with a single IP address.  Also, for smaller setups, 1 server can house multiple IP addresses.  I have 5 domain names hosted on a single IP address.  That's why you can't just go to a name.  Really the name gets resolved to an address (or one in a pool of addresses), and then when you hit that server your browser says \"Hey, I'm trying to get to [myfavoritedomain.com](https://myfavoritedomain.com)\" and the web server serves it up.",

And this is usually audible in the music. It does not always sound as obvious as in for example waltz but after some practice you should hear this in most songs. And when you listen for this and also for any rhythmic repetitions you should be able to identify a bar and then just count how many beats there is in that bar.

    "answer": "A recurrence relation is fundamentally a mathematical concept, so you're not going to fully understand it until you put some time in to think about the math. But here's an example of applying one.   Suppose you're cutting a piece of paper. Each time you cut the paper, you take all the pieces and stack them on top of each other, then cut right down the middle.   Now we want a function for the number of pieces of paper produced by c cuts. Intuitively, we know we'll go from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16... pieces of paper. We can therefore jump right to an analytic function: f(c) =2\\^(c-1). However, we can also write the recurrence relation. Each time we cut we double the number of pieces of paper we had before: r(c) = 2\\*r(c-1) for c>0. We also need to specify that we started with 1 piece of paper: r(0)=1.   Both ways of expressing the number of pieces of paper are valid and useful. For my money, the recurrence relation better expresses our intuition. Each cut produces twice as many pieces as the number we had before that cut. A computer is also very good at calculating the recurrence relation because it just means writing a simple function and calling it a bunch of times. This is not to say that a computer should have any trouble with 2\\^(c-1), but there are plenty of recursive expressions that don't have an analytical equivalent (like the Fibonacci sequence), yet they're still easy for computers. This is one reason why recurrence relations are such a big part of algorithms.",

Most modern cars are front wheel drive with the engine mounted sideways in the front with a trans-axle connecting it to the wheels.   This has the advantage that you don't need a drive shaft running through the length of the car. The engine and transmission can also be installed as a compact unit which makes assembly easier and faster.  All the engine weight also pushes down on the drive wheels which helps with traction and braking and therefore makes the car safer.

    "question": "ELI5: Why are electric appliances (e.g. blender, vacuum) so loud, when electric motors are quiet?",

First, there are different kinds of motors. \"Brushed\" motors are cheaper, but the way they're put together makes them louder and more likely to break. \"Brushless\" motors are more expensive, quieter, and easier to maintain. But some high-quality appliances use brushless motors and are still loud. Why?  Size and cost are big reasons.   Appliance motors have to be very small and fit in small spaces. They generate a lot of heat and need to pull in air to cool themselves. There's not a lot of room for sound dampening or vibration isolation, and it would make the appliances cost more. Further, a lot of the premium devices are sold based on how much power they have, and people think a louder motor has more power. (They've never thought about how a lawnmower is often louder than a car!) So not a lot of people are really shopping for a *quiet* blender or vacuum, especially if it means they become so large they aren't easy to use or so expensive they aren't worth it.   Car motors, on the other hand, are part of a very expensive purchase. People expect them to be quiet, it's one of their selling points.

    "answer": "[This is answered here very succinctly](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/7437/why-is-glass-transparent), but to summarise:    The two main factors of how a material interacts with light are its elemental composition and the arrangements of said elements (the atomic structure).  Elements have specific frequencies they absorb,  and when bonding to other elements and forming large structures these specific frequencies become whole frequency ranges.  Common glass is made of silicon dioxide and has an amorphous structure (no long range atomic structure), and it just so happens that across the visible range of wavelengths (~ 400 - 700 nvm) it doesn\u2019t absorb light.    It does absorb UV for example. Search google for something like \u201cglass transmission spectrum\u201d.",

    "answer": "When Tesla said \u201cthink of\u201d he meant rigorously. Tesla thought in ways that created functioning machines - ie rigorous and realistic ways.    I would recommend taking courses on the resonant frequency of structures, on signal theory, on physics where energy calculations are used, things like potential energy and energy flux.    If you\u2019re in college, find these courses in the syllabus. Or if you\u2019re not in STEM and don\u2019t know where to start, go to a STEM student or prof and help them find you classes where you\u2019ll learn about those things: resonant frequency, signals, energy-based physics (such as calculating the height a roller coaster will go based on potential energy instead of based on velocity and acceleration), thermodynamics, waves.    And if you\u2019re \u201cbad at math\u201d, change your self-conception and push yourself to get better. Math is about practice more than it is about talent. And math is necessary to really, truly appreciate the beauty of these ways of thinking. So make friends with math.    If you\u2019re not at a university, use Khan academy or any university\u2019s free online courses to study this stuff.     The key point is to study it rigorously - this means homework and math, not just reading a popular science book about the mysteries of the universe.

The second is that it's left over material from the formation of Saturn that never fell into Saturn but was too close to form into a moon in the first place (because of the Roche limit)  They first means the rings weren't always there, and their age would be unknown and thus it's possible they may decay at some point.  The second means the rings were always there, and are stable enough to last 4.5 billions years, implying they are going nowhere.

    "answer": "That is basically an age-old battle between power generation and power consumption.  For solar energy you need space and sun. Lots of it actually, and while in some countries the weather pattern is enough for solar generation, in many countries solar energy on a private site like a normal house can only supply X percentage of your daily / yearly consumption. This is of course still a major benefit, hence more and more buildings incorporate some kind of regenerative system (even only to reduce normal energy costs by a few percent).  For cars however this is a bit problematic, as the space on a car roof is simply way too small to generate energy to generate enough energy efficiently enough to power batteries ... not even considering tunnels, bad weather, being in a garage or roofed parking lot, inside the shadows of skyscrapers in a city or a forest etc. You can optimize your solar energy generation at your home. You cannot do that nearly as good for a car.  Now in theory they can at least supply a bit of energy, but the next issue would be the price. For a building costing hundreds of thousands of EUR the price for a solar system is relatively low (compared to the building price). For a car, the relative price would be much higher, noticeably increasing the cars price ... and e-cars are trying to make their way in an extremely competitive environment, where even a few hundred EUR can already influence the purchase decision of a buyer.   Last but not least: cars are designed in their form and looks with specific goals in mind (good looks, areodynamics etc). Commercial solar panels cannot (yet) be brought into the form necessary for a seamless integration in the often curved roof or an engine hood. There are some developments where solar cells can be formed like plastics, but IIRC they are still a bit out of range of normal, large scale, commercial use.  In the end solar generation integrated into the hull of a vehicle will be coming, but only to supply some additional energy for onboard equipment like radios, lights etc.  SYL",

People in love can be so head-over-heels that they would be willing to break ties with their family, friends and other social structures just to be with the object of their fixation.  \"True love\" is when your own genetic stake becomes intermixed with the partner's, to the extent of sharing common offspring. Personal boundaries dissolve and the other becomes part of your self-identity - the thought of losing that person (and their necessary presence to produce offspring) becomes akin to the thought of losing a part of yourself. Your self-preservation instincts jump over and apply to that person. Indeed, in the extreme, dying for the sake of your partner becomes a possibility. (One that, in the case of men dying for women, is genetically justified - not only could they be pregnant, but men are also more disposable than women)  People romanticize this concept by giving it names such as \"true love\" to justify their insanity to others, often when challenged or pointed out.",

    "question": "ELI5: If the body raises its temperature to kill bacteria, why is it bad to take a hot shower when you have a fever?",
    "answer": "It\u2019s not bad to take a hot shower during a fever, it\u2019s just uncomfortable. At the same time, taking a cold shower is not recommended because as your skin (periphery) cools down due to cold water, the body tries to compensate by increasing your core (inside) temperature which we don\u2019t want in a patient already suffering from fever. Hence lukewarm water is the best for this situation.  Now there are chemical compounds called pyrogens (molecules that cause fever). Usually the process goes like this : bacteria/virus/microorganisms enter our body, body/immune system detects certain proteins and chemical structures on them (like the cell wall,etc), sends a signal to the brain, brain is like oops need to kill that, need more ammo, so they release some other substances/chemical compounds which further activates the immune system.  Now both the microorganisms and the brain/immune system\u2019s compounds are what we call pyrogens.  So exogenous ( from outside) pyrogens like bacteria give rise to endogenous (from inside the body) pyrogens like the immune system cells which increases the body temperature level just the way you adjust the thermostat to a higher setting.

    "answer": "Any system have angular momentum, around a pivot of choice. Spin is just angular momentum of a particle when considered alone.  Angular momentum are *not* the L=r x v from classical Newtonian mechanics. Instead, we define angular momentum by their main defining characteristic: it is preserved under all continuous rotations. The classical Newtonian angular momentum is a formula that give you a preserved quantity, assuming Newtonian physics is correct. But once we move into the weirder realm of quantum mechanics, we have to abandon the formula and stick with the most important property, the fact that it's preserved under continuous rotations.  Given an arbitrary axis (this axis is normally named z), we can talk about angular momentum around this axis. This is a measurable number that is preserved under all continuous rotations around that axis. Due to funky issue with quantum physics, you can't actually talk about angular momentum around all axis at the same time, because trying to measure this number around one axis disrupt the rest; in fact it's not even possible to talk angular momentum about 2 axes at the same time. However, you can talk about magnitude squared of total angular momentum (when you consider rotation around ALL axis), which IS a number that can be measured.  Without loss of generality, we can assume that we do have a special z-axis where angular momentum exist, because this allows us to have an additional number to identify an electron: the secondary spin number.  If you consider one single particle by itself, this angular momentum give you the spin number, and the angular momentum around one specific z-axis give you the secondary spin number. For an electron, the spin number is fixed to be 1/2, so really you only care about secondary spin number. If you assume that there exist angular momentum around the z-axis, this 1/2 spin number - which tell you angular momentum - limit the possible value of angular momentum around the z-axis. By choosing 1 direction to be called \"up\" (associated with positive number) and the other direction \"down\", we have 2 values +1/2 and -1/2. But warning: this \"up\" and \"down\" don't have any actual geometric meaning, they are merely analogy from classical Newtonian mechanics where angular momentum is represented by a vector that can actually point up or down.  When you consider an atom together with an electron, the whole system itself have a different number that are also angular momentum (of the system). This is called total angular momentum. The electron, when considered alone, have its own angular momentum which is called spin. Subtracting the spin number from the total angular momentum give you orbital angular momentum. Since electron all have the same spin number, you only need orbital angular momentum and secondary spin number if you want to distinguish electrons by angular momentum.",

Scientists who have studied this process observed that [it happens more cleanly and efficiently when the wound is kept \"wet\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3842869/). In this context, wet doesn't mean wet like under water. It means a mechanism is used to prevent the body's natural fluids from drying out. In other words, preventing a scab from forming.  Neosporin is mostly petroleum jelly, plus some anti-biotics. Interestingly enough, the anti-biotics aren't the primary source of improvement in healing; it's the petroleum jelly. In fact, many dermatologists (skin doctors) advise against using anti-biotic ointments like Neosporin because the anti-biotics can cause allergic reactions.  You can get very similar results by following these steps:  1. Flush the wound with soap and water immediately. Yes, this will sting, but this is the best way to disinfect a wound while preserving the live tissue. 2. Apply an anti-biotic ointment during the first application of a bandage. 3. Change the band-aid twice a day. Once when you get up, and once before you go to bed. Apply regular old petroleum jelly instead of anti-biotic ointment.

For example, say there are 1 million shares of a company. A normal short would be borrowing 100 shares and paying a premium to open a contract giving you the right to sell those shares at a price (the strike price) regardless of what the price is. This means if the stock goes down you can sell it for more than its worth. A naked short, is borrowing shares that aren\u2019t determined to exist. This means if there are 1 million shares, and someone\u2019s buys short contracts worth more shares than what exist in the market, it\u2019s artificial.

However this is a common practice by many financial institutions such as hedge funds (citadel for example).   As for what happened on CNBC, an anchor woman actually called what the current hedge funds and market participants naked shorting, in reference to AMC and GameStop stock.

    "answer": "In ERCOT (Texas) everything was \"unbundled\" when the industry was de-regulated (or re-regulated depending on your viewpoint). So generation is independent of transmission and distribution. Energy Service Providers (ESP's) sell energy to the end consumer buy buying energy from the generators through a QSE (Qualified Scheduling Entity) and delivering to the end user on transmission and distribution lines, which may or may not be one company. The distribution company (the \"Wires\" company) is the one that delivers your power to point of use. This is the one you have no choice over, since each has it's own territory.  Energy at every point (generation, transmission, distribution) is metered by extremely accurate meters that have to meet exacting standards. These are the \"settlement\" meters. There are also the meters on your home.  The \"settlement\" meters are  all time stamped at a minimum of every 15 minutes, although I believe generation is actually at 5 minute intervals. All this metering data is routed through ERCOT where generation output is matched against all the various transmission/distribution metering points, and ultimately balanced out against the end metering at your house. This is the only way it can be done, since the grid is entirely interconnected (internally), so generation is about like pumping a water well into a river, then monitoring who pulls water out.  Once all the data has been processed, fund allocations are made based on who bought what from whom at what price and what time. Even though the metering has 15 minutes intervals, the billing is usually done on an hourly basis.  Anyone can play. Grid generation is determined by who can offer \"base\" load at the cheapest price. This is the load that is pretty much there all the time. The \"intermediate\" load (i.e., the day gets warmer and load goes up from base) is the generation that is slightly more expensive. The highest cost generation comes on at peak (late afternoon in a Texas summer). The ESP's (remember them) try to study their load patterns, weather predictions, etc. and arrange through the QSE's to acquire given amounts of power at given times. Since \"anyone can play\" this means that the end user (you) can use a solar or wind turbine to generate back into the grid through your house meter and receive compensation.  ESP's are responsible for their costs. If they don't schedule enough energy, they end up paying a premium price at peak loads (aka, the recent ice storm). On the flip side, if they schedule too much and don't need it, they can either try to sell it on the market, or pay for it even though they didn't need it.  The \"wires\" companies get their money by fixed rates based on their \"cost of service\" and often tie in an extra charge based on kwh usage. They do not market \"energy\" unless they are an Electric Cooperative (which I think is unique to ERCOT). So the \"wires\" companys roll is to provide the actual service and metering.  There are more \"fun and games\" money making schemes like Congestion Revenue Rights if you want to look up an example of capitalism at it's finest (or worst).",

    "answer": "When Tesla said \u201cthink of\u201d he meant rigorously. Tesla thought in ways that created functioning machines - ie rigorous and realistic ways.    I would recommend taking courses on the resonant frequency of structures, on signal theory, on physics where energy calculations are used, things like potential energy and energy flux.    If you\u2019re in college, find these courses in the syllabus. Or if you\u2019re not in STEM and don\u2019t know where to start, go to a STEM student or prof and help them find you classes where you\u2019ll learn about those things: resonant frequency, signals, energy-based physics (such as calculating the height a roller coaster will go based on potential energy instead of based on velocity and acceleration), thermodynamics, waves.    And if you\u2019re \u201cbad at math\u201d, change your self-conception and push yourself to get better. Math is about practice more than it is about talent. And math is necessary to really, truly appreciate the beauty of these ways of thinking. So make friends with math.    If you\u2019re not at a university, use Khan academy or any university\u2019s free online courses to study this stuff.

It seems to me that this is less secure than an old chipless card that at least requires a PIN.",
    "answer": "The chip and/or the PIN are a means of verifying the transaction is legit.  On a card without the chip, the only data is its number, the expiration date, and maybe the verification code on the back. The magnetic stripe is usually just the card number. These kinds of terminals require the PIN because (hopefully) only the authorized cardholder knows that PIN. These cards are easy to duplicate so we NEED extra security measures.  Cards with a chip, on the other hand, are a lot harder to replicate. The chip is actually a tiny computer that does some math on some inputs and generates numbers in a way that isn't easy to guess even if you see it done for a few thousand inputs. The bank who issues the card knows the secret information that makes it possible to predict the numbers. So, oversimplified, when you use a chip reader, the terminal gives the chip some inputs, gets the chip's result, then sends the inputs and the results to the bank. The bank verifies that the inputs should produce that output on your chip. So in a way, the chip IS the PIN, but it's more secure than that because you can't accidentally give someone knowledge that makes them able to replicate your chip.  It's probably possible to copy a card with a chip, but it would take a high degree of sophistication and someone would have to physically steal your card to do it. You can't reproduce the chip from observing a single read, and in theory even seeing hundreds of thousands of input/output wouldn't be useful. Because it's incredibly close to impossible to duplicate these chips, when a terminal uses the chip as an ID you don't have to use a PIN. The assumption is it means someone would've had to have stolen your actual card and you'd probably notice that much more quickly than it takes to figure out someone's skimmed a traditional card.",

So there is no real issue to resolve here and, no, banks don't need to cart around pieces of paper from location to location. Bank A simply electronically transfers funds to Bank B and vice versa, as required.   Banks do loan each other money though. The reasons for that are more complicated generally. Banks are required (by law) to maintain a certain money \"reserve\" in their accounts at the Central Bank in accordance with their deposits and loans.

    "answer": "Firstly the main purpose of a space station is to do microgravity research. Launching a big expensive space station just to simulate Earth conditions would be counter productive in this setting.  There have however been a few suggestions for how to create artificial gravity by spinning up parts or the entire space station and create centrifugal forces that simulate gravity. There are however issues such as possible oscillations, how to dock with such a space station, how to interface rotating and stationary components, etc.  In fact there was a big centrifuge module constructed for the ISS. The purpose was to be able to simulate Lunar or Mars gravity for research programs, test out designs for centrifugal space stations, conduct control experiments in space, and so on. But due to issues with balancing such a huge rotating mass inside a fragile space station it was limited in size and was not big enough for humans, only rodents and plants. Sadly due to issues with funding and delays in the construction of ISS this module was parked in a parking lot in Japan and have not moved in over twenty years.  There is currently some suggestions for one of research missions with the new cheaper spacecraft that have come on the market the last decade. The plans usually involves tying a long tether between the spacecraft and the upper stage booster that put it in orbit. This configuration could then be spun up using the thrusters and therefore generating a nice stable simulated gravity at very low cost. This could be used for low gravity research, something we currently are unable to do, or even to create gravity for transit missions to Mars.",

    "question": "ELI5: Once a lottery like Mega Millions has a high enough jackpot so that the expected value of the ticket is higher than the cost, why does it still feel like it\u2019s a bad investment to buy a ticket?",
    "answer": "Let's simplify things and consider a lottery that just has one big jackpot and no other prizes. Let's say the odds of winning this jackpot are 1 in 300 million (that's roughly the [odds](https://www.megamillions.com/How-to-Play.aspx) for getting all the numbers right to win the Mega Millions jackpot). Instead of drawing a set of numbers, let's say you just roll a 300 million-sided die and you win the jackpot if it comes up '1'. Let's say the jackpot is $1 billion and it costs $2 for each roll of the die.  Your expected winnings per roll are $1 billion / 300 million = $3.33. Clearly, that's more than it costs and so statistically you expect to make a profit. That is, if you could roll the die enough times, your winnings would equal $3.33 per roll, for a profit of $1.33 per roll. For instance, if you were able to play 1 trillion times, you'd almost certainly make a profit close to $1.33 trillion.  The problem, of course, is that you can't afford to play 1 trillion times. You have neither the time nor the upfront cash to finance that. So it doesn't matter how the statistics work out in the long run. The important thing is: is there a reasonable probability that you'll make a return on your investment before either your time or your money runs out?   Clearly, you need to win the jackpot at least once in order to have a chance to make a profit. Note that you're not guaranteed to make a profit once you win - if it takes too many rolls, you'll still be making a loss. But if you don't win even once, you'll certainly make a loss.  So how often do you need to roll the die to win the jackpot at least once? Well, it's never a sure thing that you'll win, but let's say we want to have at least an 80% probability. How often do we need to roll the die for that? The probability that you'll wint the jackpot at least once in N rolls is 1-p^(N) where p is the probability of not winning, i.e. 1-(1/300 million). So we have to solve 1-p^(N) = 0.8, i.e. p^(N) = 0.2. We can solve this by taking the logarithm of 0.2 in base *p*. If none of that makes sense to you, don't worry, just note that this is a mathematical way of answering the question: how many times do I need to roll this die so that I'll have an 80% probability of winning the jackpot at least once?  The answer turns out to be over 482 million times. That's an investment of $964 million, not to mention how much time it takes to roll a die that many times.  And therein lies the rub. You do not have the time nor the money to play the lottery enough times to have any reasonable hope of making a return on your investment. Not to mention, how are you even going to buy that many lottery tickets? They don't stock that many at your local corner store, and I doubt that Mega Millions is going to allow you to purchase that many tickets from them directly.  Also, note that even with 482 million rolls, there's still a 20% chance that you don't win the jackpot, and then you've accumulated losses of almost $1 trillion. To really be sure of a profit, you need to be playing tens of billions of times.  **In short, the problem is that the expected profit comes from a teenie, tiny probability of winning a large amount of money. If you had a 50% probability of winning $6.66 on a ticket that costs $2, the expected profit would also be $1.33 per ticket, only then you'd only have to play like a dozen times in order to be pretty sure of a profit. So it's not about the expected value of the winnings distribution, it's about how uneven it is.**",

Same thing for your scalp. On almost every adult is a yeast-like organism that munches on the oils of your hair.

    "question": "eli5 - how much better is the James Webb Space Telescope than Hubble ? Is it like a leap from SD to 4K or even greater still ?",
    "answer": "Light takes time to travel.   Here on Earth and in such small scales, light is almost instant; however, when you increase in distance, so too does light's travel time. Light from the Sun takes eight minutes to reach Earth, so when you look up at the Sun (please, with proper protection) you are quite literally seeing the Sun as it was eight minutes ago. You are looking eight minutes in the past! You're a glorified time traveler!  Now let's increase the distance to five light-years, with a single light-year being the distance light travels in one year in a vacuum. If you point a telescope towards something that is five light-years away, you are seeing that object as it was five years ago.  Now, while light travels through space-time, space-time itself expands. The expansion of the Universe and the space-time within it causes light to *shift* towards red wavelengths. The further out you look, the more red an object will appear.  This shift is Doppler Shift. You can experience this with sound! Did you ever hear a car drive closer and closer towards your position and it sounds like it's increasing in frequency? And the moment it passes you that frequency sounds like it's decreasing? That [*\"\"Neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-oooooooooooooooooooo\"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC4Lp7k4zrI) sound is Doppler Shift with sound frequencies. The same can be applied to the electromagnetic spectrum (the spectrum in which light is apart of).  Now what does this have to do with Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)?  Well, Hubble detects visible light (what our human eyes can see), along with ***some*** ultraviolet and near-infrared wavelengths. It's a very narrow part of the spectrum of what Hubble can detect.  Now when we point Hubble outwards into the vast distance of the Universe, this light shifts and becomes more and more red! So red in fact that their light is no longer in the visible spectrum, it's in the infrared wavelengths! Bonkers right! Now because it's so in the infrared wavelengths, Hubble can no longer detect these far away objects.  Remember when I said the farther away an object is the longer it takes for the light to reach us? Well, these objects are so far away that the light we are looking at was emitted close to the birth of the universe--the Big Bang! Wow!  But the further we look out and back in time, the more red these objects are. The more invisible they become to Hubble.  Here is where JWST comes into play. As you can see [here](https://imgur.com/dsUafLF), JWST is specializing in the infrared wavelengths while Hubble specializes in the visible spectrum.   Now we have a telescope that can see redder objects, objects that are *wayyyy* out there. These objects are so far back in time that they will help us write/discover the first chapters of the universe. Hubble gave us chapters all the way back to Chapter 4, but JWST will give us Chapters 3-to-2, maybe the later half of Chapter 1! Who knows what we'll discover!  Now, because the JWST specializes in infrared light, NASA and its international partners had to plan around the heat emitted from the Earth and Sun. That is why its orbit is placed 1.5m km (1m miles) away from Earth in L2. Additionally, they added solar shielding to block solar heat from tampering with its sensors! These temperatures fluctuate, but as of writing this comment, the hot side (facing the Sun) is currently 130 degrees F, while the cold side (facing away from the Sun and Earth) is currently -328 degrees F. So cold!  Finally to answer your question, technically the JWST is more powerful than Hubble; however, it's unfair to say it's overall better than it because both are just designed for different mission sets. Yes, the JWST is the successor to Hubble but they'll still work in tandem and help with scientific discoveries!.  I hope this helps!",

I'll take a stab at lowering that to 5  'grounding' is basically needed to ensure that everything is at the same 'electrical level' (voltage).The hazard of not grounding something is that if the electrical level (voltage) is different in one place compared to another and you touch both, it becomes level by going through you (not good). So as long as everything you touch is all the same level it won't go through you because there is nowhere for it to go. As long as everything in the ISS is all connected to the frame so that it is all the same level (voltage) you are safe.  This is why if a utility truck touches a power line and a worker gets out and touches the truck (high level/voltage) and the ground (low level/voltage) at the same time the electricity goes through their body and shocks them badly. If their co-worker JUMPS onto the ground and is never the bridge between the two levels (voltages) at the same time, they will be safe.

Every time you perform an action, your brain thinks of how it wants to perform that action and your cerebellum helps to coordinate it. It also cross checks what the intended action was with what you actually did. It gradually fine tunes these actions to get better and better.  This is seen in practice of any physical task. Basketball for example: you try and shoot to make it in the hoop but keep missing short and to the left.

    "answer": "The fold in the eyelid you are describing is called the epicanthic fold. it's associated with greater levels of fat deposition around the eyeball, a feature that is the most prominent in native North Siberian, Aleutian and Inuit populations. The extra tissue is thought to provide greater insulation for the eye and sinuses from the effects of cold, especially from freezing winds, and to represent an adaptation to cold climates. That means that in extreme temperatures, their faces would be more protected from sub-zero temperatures which could freeze the nose, lips, eyelids and severely irritate and cause cold injuries to the sinuses. It has also been suggested that the fold itself may provide a level of protection from snow blindness. In extreme periods of cold, those who could see best in blinding sunlight reflecting off of snow and ice could hunt most successfully.  its appearance in peoples of Southeast Asia can be linked to possible descent from cold-adapted ancestors, its occurrence in various African peoples doesn't follow a cold-adaptive explanation for it appearing in the latter groups. The epicanthic fold found in the san African people has been tentatively linked to protection for the eye from the high levels of ultraviolet light found in desert and semi-desert areas.

    "question": "ELI5: If electrical providers share the same power lines, how do they know who is consuming whose power?",
    "answer": "In ERCOT (Texas) everything was \"unbundled\" when the industry was de-regulated (or re-regulated depending on your viewpoint). So generation is independent of transmission and distribution. Energy Service Providers (ESP's) sell energy to the end consumer buy buying energy from the generators through a QSE (Qualified Scheduling Entity) and delivering to the end user on transmission and distribution lines, which may or may not be one company. The distribution company (the \"Wires\" company) is the one that delivers your power to point of use. This is the one you have no choice over, since each has it's own territory.  Energy at every point (generation, transmission, distribution) is metered by extremely accurate meters that have to meet exacting standards. These are the \"settlement\" meters. There are also the meters on your home.  The \"settlement\" meters are  all time stamped at a minimum of every 15 minutes, although I believe generation is actually at 5 minute intervals. All this metering data is routed through ERCOT where generation output is matched against all the various transmission/distribution metering points, and ultimately balanced out against the end metering at your house. This is the only way it can be done, since the grid is entirely interconnected (internally), so generation is about like pumping a water well into a river, then monitoring who pulls water out.  Once all the data has been processed, fund allocations are made based on who bought what from whom at what price and what time. Even though the metering has 15 minutes intervals, the billing is usually done on an hourly basis.  Anyone can play. Grid generation is determined by who can offer \"base\" load at the cheapest price. This is the load that is pretty much there all the time. The \"intermediate\" load (i.e., the day gets warmer and load goes up from base) is the generation that is slightly more expensive. The highest cost generation comes on at peak (late afternoon in a Texas summer). The ESP's (remember them) try to study their load patterns, weather predictions, etc. and arrange through the QSE's to acquire given amounts of power at given times. Since \"anyone can play\" this means that the end user (you) can use a solar or wind turbine to generate back into the grid through your house meter and receive compensation.  ESP's are responsible for their costs. If they don't schedule enough energy, they end up paying a premium price at peak loads (aka, the recent ice storm). On the flip side, if they schedule too much and don't need it, they can either try to sell it on the market, or pay for it even though they didn't need it.  The \"wires\" companies get their money by fixed rates based on their \"cost of service\" and often tie in an extra charge based on kwh usage. They do not market \"energy\" unless they are an Electric Cooperative (which I think is unique to ERCOT). So the \"wires\" companys roll is to provide the actual service and metering.  There are more \"fun and games\" money making schemes like Congestion Revenue Rights if you want to look up an example of capitalism at it's finest (or worst).",

At first, they were arbitrary, then people bumped into problems. Like, the foot - presume our feet are different lengths... I can go even earlier with the cubit, supposedly the length from your elbow to your finger tip. Can you see a problem here?  So the second was first a division of a day. Then it was a fraction of a solar day. Then it was defined by a fraction of a year, because our orbit around the sun is more stable than our rotation about our axis. A lot changed starting in the 1940s with the quartz clock.  But the thing is, we had, for a long, long time, a pretty much agreed upon definition for what a second was, if not imperfect. So if you're going to invent an atomic clock, or any device that is really, really accurate at counting divisions of time, then you're going to want to fit it to peoples expectations. They back-fit the definition to what was approximately a second, since a second prior was always approximate anyway.  But it's really hard to define a \"base\" unit of time. What is the smallest unit of time that there can be? The smallest unit of time that can be measured? We don't actually know.

So you need two inputs: what is the thing you're looking at, and what's the knob you turn to make the thing change. Usually the first input is a number, or numbers, say, the temperatures of every key on your keyboard. There are typically two knobs to turn: the time knob or the \"space\" knob. They just return different gradients. The time knob will take only one key of the keyboard as input and will tell you how fast the current temperature of that key changes over time. Use another key as input, and you get the current change of temperature. This is a gradient over time, it will tell you how the input temperature changes at one point on the keyboard.  The other knob is the spatial knob. It takes as input the key again, but it will tell you how the temperature changes as you move from this key down, or left. So while the first gradient is change in temperature per minute, the second is change in temperature per inch. As such, a gradient can be used as prediction. If you know the current temperature of a key and the time-gradient, you can calculate roughly how warm the key will be in 3 minutes. And likely: if you know the spacial gradient, you can estimate how warm the key on the left is.  Edit: using time and space knobs are the most common  gradients. But there are more knobs, generally anything that has an influence on your input can be used as knob: everything else returns a very boring gradient that is 0 everywhere, no matter how much you turn that knob, your input doesn't change.",

    "answer": "First of all, there are some similarity between Machine Learning (ML) and stats, there are even some definite overlap, e.g. Linear Regression. Hence, the memes:  https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*x7P7gqjo8k2_bj2rTQWAfg.jpeg  https://miro.medium.com/max/2560/1*mXeEWBymq-UXPXF2Oai5mg.jpeg  https://i.redd.it/4f71u8ti5hg31.jpg  What makes things more complicated is that ML is an extremely rapidly growing field, what it IS changes from month to month (usually growing). So it is kinda hard to tell the difference.  So here is my extremely simplified version:  * The purpose of statistics is that so HUMAN can understand the data  * The purpose of ML is to make PREDICTION.  For example, you are a CEO, and sales is down this month. If you want to know why, so you can do something about it, you get a statisticians. If you want to know what is sales for next month, so you know how much stock you have to order, you get an ML expert.  But here is a good example where things get complicated. Explainable AI and causal inference are definitely under ML, although they are supposed to answer the \"why\" question, on top of making prediction. There are also things like clustering, that also attempts to give human insights into the data.  A better explanations is that some tools, like neural network, are born out of the ML field, and regardless of what is used for. It will always be considered as ML, not stats.  ******************  So here's my summary. In the past, everything is stats. Then some people are interested in making predictions using the tools in stats, so ML was simply a subfield of stats. Then a number of ML specific tools (like neural network) were made. So now, anything that uses those tools, are considered as ML, regardless or purpose (e.g. XAI and causal inference). Worse, people are enhancing those ML tools with classical stats tools (e.g. Bayesian + neural network). In those cases, more often than not, the ML labels stick.  (I know this is a bad history, because ML is born out of CS and AI, not stats. But ELI5)  So, the distinction between ML and stats is more like the distinction between a main course and a dessert.

If something can do all three of those things, then they technically have enough power to do anything any other computer can. Whether it can do it at the same speed or not, well, Turing completeness makes no promises about speed.  An analogy to Turing completeness would be like if there was something called \"math complete\", which checked if a language could do all mathematical operations.  If there was a language that could perform addition on any number, then it would be \"math complete\". Why? Because it can simulate subtraction by changing the second number to negative (e.g. it can do 8 - 5 by performing 8 + -5). It can simulate multiplication by adding repeatedly (e.g. it can do 2 * 3 by performing 2 + 2 + 2). It can simulate division by counting how many times it needs to add to reach a number (e.g. it can do 6 \u00f7 2 by performing 2 + 2 + 2 and observing that it takes three 2s to make 6).  A language that can only do addition is slower and longer than a language that can do all mathematical operations, but it can still get the answer at the end of the day.  Likewise, something that is Turing-complete can compute anything any other Turing-complete computer can calculate. It may be slower and its instructions may be much longer and much more complicated, but there will be an equivalent way to write instructions for it to perform the same calculation another computer can do.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why do matrices get transposed and what's the use of this function in the real world?",
    "answer": "If you want to do machine learning I don't think it makes sense to start learning the coding side with little to no math background. Some linear algebra and statistics are going to make it much easier for you to understand what you're doing. Otherwise you just end up copying bits of code that make no sense to you.   That being said, matrices and the operations you can do on them are basically just convenient mathematical shorthand for working with sets of numbers that have a certain structure to them. For instance, in a matrix the rows often correspond to one variable, and the columns to another. For instance, each column might be a quantity that you measured, and then each row contains a set of simultaneous measurements of all these quantities. To make that even more concrete, each row might be a different house, and then the columns might be the square footage, distance to the nearest mall, and price of each house.   In other words, matrices are basically just tables, but without the headers that tell you what each row or column represents.  Transposing a matrix just means swapping the rows and columns. So in our example, you now would have square footage in row 1, distance to nearest mall in row 2, and price in row 3, and then each column is now a different house for which you recorded those three numbers.   Why do we transpose? That has to do with the operations you can do on matrices. Specifically,  matrix multiplication. Matrix multiplication is different from *scalar* multiplication (scalars are just single numbers, as opposed to vectors or matrices which contain multiple numbers). If you have two scalars *a* and *b*, then *ab* = *ba.* That is, the order of multiplication doesn't matter. But if you have two matrices, *A* and *B*, then in general, you don't have *AB = BA.* And in fact, you may not even be able to compute both of these products. That's because, for matrix multiplication, the dimensions of the matrices need to match up in a certain way. For instance, if *A* is a \\[10 x 3\\] matrix, that means it has 10 rows and 3 columns. Now let's say *B* is a \\[3 x 8\\] matrix. In that case, the matrix product *AB* will have size \\[10 x 8\\]. The sizes that went into the multiplication were \\[10 x 3\\]\\*\\[3 x 8\\]. Notice that the 3 matches up between the two matrices, and disappears from the resulting matrix. That's important. If these numbers didn't match up, then you couldn't multiply these matrices. For instance, if *A* were \\[10 x 5\\], for instance, then you simply wouldn't be able to multiply *A* by *B*.   But let's go back to the situation where *A* was \\[10 x 3\\]. We were able to compute the matrix product *AB* because the dimensions matched up. But if we swap the order to *BA*, now the dimensions that go into the product are \\[3 x 8\\]\\*\\[10 x 3\\]. Now the \"outer\" dimensions match up, but that's no good. It has to be the \"inner\" dimensions that are the same.   This is all just to illustrate that matrix products depend on having dimensions that match up in a certain way. Note that I haven't described how to actually calculate a matrix product, and I won't go into that. Again, I highly recommend that you take a (free, online) linear algebra course to learn all about that. All you need to remember for now is that there is this operation called a matrix product and it depends on getting the matrix dimensions to match up.  Now suppose that we have a matrix *C* that has size \\[3 x 7\\]. Can we multiply this with *B* (which is \\[3 x 8\\]? Not as it is. *CB* would be \\[3 x 7\\]\\*\\[3 x 8\\], and *BC* would be \\[3 x 8\\]\\*\\[3 \\* 7\\]. The inner dimensions don't match in either case. But what if we *transpose* *C*? Recall that this means swapping the rows and columns. We write the transposed version of *C* as *C**^(T)**.* When we transpose, the dimensions of the matrix are swapped, so *C**^(T)* has size \\[7 x 3\\]. Aha, but that means that we *can* calculate the product *C**^(T)**B*! Because then we're multiplying matrices of dimensions \\[7 x 3\\]\\*\\[3 x 8\\], so now the inner dimensions *do* match up, and the result is a new matrix of size \\[7 x 8\\].   So in short, there are operations that we can do on matrices, which depend on the arrangement of their rows and columns. Transposing a matrix changes this arrangement in a particular way, that is very often useful or necessary.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why does driving at high (interstate) speeds and hitting standing water (deep enough to splash) cause you to feel a push perpendicular to your car's movement?",
    "answer": "Hoo boy. That is a simple question with a very complex answer. To understand why you need to understand torque and angular momentum in spinning bodies.  So the basics you need to know is we measure the force of something spinning by its angular momentum. This force is a tangent to the circle or a straight line only intersecting the spin at one point. You can visualize this by spinning something on the end of a string then letting it go. That object on a string will fly off in one direction. That direction is the direction of the force being applied at that moment. Which indicates to you the direction of it's angular momentum.  Now we go to torque. To make something spin it needs to be fixed to a singular point. There must be an axis which it spins around and resists that straight line force we call angular momentum. Otherwise the spin would just turn to linear force. As we know from physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. So as the axis pulls against the object, so to must the object pull against the axis. That pull on the axis is what we call a torque. The direction of that torque force is defined with a right hand rule. If you point your right hand and curl your fingers in the direction of the spin and stick your thumb out, the direction of your thumb is the direction of the torque force. Notice your thumb is now pointing perpendicular to the spin.   (A YouTube video to explain it in depth https://youtu.be/mRZGdvJQnPU)  Now we tie that back into your car. So all 4 wheels on your car are spinning. As we just established that means they have angular momentum and torque. Fortunately for you the torque is normally not enough to overcome the friction between your tires and the road. So you never feel that torque. However, when you hit a deep enough puddle, all that friction is removed and the perpendicular torque force of your car easily can pull you sideways.",

    "answer": "Any system have angular momentum, around a pivot of choice. Spin is just angular momentum of a particle when considered alone.  Angular momentum are *not* the L=r x v from classical Newtonian mechanics. Instead, we define angular momentum by their main defining characteristic: it is preserved under all continuous rotations. The classical Newtonian angular momentum is a formula that give you a preserved quantity, assuming Newtonian physics is correct. But once we move into the weirder realm of quantum mechanics, we have to abandon the formula and stick with the most important property, the fact that it's preserved under continuous rotations.  Given an arbitrary axis (this axis is normally named z), we can talk about angular momentum around this axis. This is a measurable number that is preserved under all continuous rotations around that axis. Due to funky issue with quantum physics, you can't actually talk about angular momentum around all axis at the same time, because trying to measure this number around one axis disrupt the rest; in fact it's not even possible to talk angular momentum about 2 axes at the same time. However, you can talk about magnitude squared of total angular momentum (when you consider rotation around ALL axis), which IS a number that can be measured.  Without loss of generality, we can assume that we do have a special z-axis where angular momentum exist, because this allows us to have an additional number to identify an electron: the secondary spin number.  If you consider one single particle by itself, this angular momentum give you the spin number, and the angular momentum around one specific z-axis give you the secondary spin number. For an electron, the spin number is fixed to be 1/2, so really you only care about secondary spin number. If you assume that there exist angular momentum around the z-axis, this 1/2 spin number - which tell you angular momentum - limit the possible value of angular momentum around the z-axis. By choosing 1 direction to be called \"up\" (associated with positive number) and the other direction \"down\", we have 2 values +1/2 and -1/2. But warning: this \"up\" and \"down\" don't have any actual geometric meaning, they are merely analogy from classical Newtonian mechanics where angular momentum is represented by a vector that can actually point up or down.  When you consider an atom together with an electron, the whole system itself have a different number that are also angular momentum (of the system). This is called total angular momentum. The electron, when considered alone, have its own angular momentum which is called spin. Subtracting the spin number from the total angular momentum give you orbital angular momentum. Since electron all have the same spin number, you only need orbital angular momentum and secondary spin number if you want to distinguish electrons by angular momentum.",

The real reason is that people typically choose what they are drinking based off of their mood  Bad day = Whiskey  Party Funtime = Tequila  \"Lets get ripped brah\" = \"lets mix Jaegar, Fireball and jetfuel and butt chug it\"....then the next morning they say, \"fireball makes me act crazy\"",

Epinephrine (also called adrenaline) is a very important neurotransmitter, and that's also what's in EpiPens. But this doesn't always work for a few reasons.  First, a lot of those chemicals can't easily get from our blood into our brain tissue (or vice versa) since there's a protective barrier. Even the dopamine pump above uses a modified version of dopamine that can, but we can't always do that well.  Second, when you dump a bunch of hormones or chemicals on the body the body reacts by making less of that hormone itself to try to keep itself in balance. This can sometimes cause serious side effects.  Third, very very few problems in the brain are due to a simple issue of \"not enough of a single chemical\" (even Parkinson's, which is basically caused by the brain not being able to make dopamine anymore, is more complicated) You don't water plants in your house with a fire hose because the water that's really good for the plants isn't so great for your computer on the desk next to them.

You do have the legal right to take the property, however you have limited power to use any force. So if the person sees you about to repo their car, and decides to jump into the car, you can not physically remove them. You also can not tow the car with them inside it. If you can block the car from leaving it\u2019s current location then you have every right to call the police, and they will gladly force the person to get out, and assist you with the repo. This sounds great but the downside is that you have to stay with the car until the police arrive. This could take an hour or more.

    "answer": "GPUs now are a bit like \"programmable CPUs\", or ASICs.   Basically, you can program them to do functions in hardware. Some very specific functions are used for mining cryptos, usually one specific algorithm per crypto family ( i say family because nearly every bitcoin derived cryptos use the same algorithm). Mostly, GPUs are used to mine ethereum, because that is the crypto that earns the most. It will also stop being that much profitable in july, with some modifications to the transaction system, and it is supposed to go \"proof of stake\", meaning it cannot be mined anymore, by the end of the year.  &#x200B;  That being said, nvidia's new GPU lock means it will recognise the algorithm used to mine ethereum, and perform lower when found. The algorithm is very unlikely to ever be used for gaming or video editing.  Note: unlike the previous \"soft lock\" , that was a kind of an added identifier chip on the board that the driver would read, then cut performance or not, the new one is supposedly a \"hardware lock\", meaning the locking part is IN the GPU and cannot be bypassed.  &#x200B;  Now, the reason nvidia does that is simply to shift the blame from them to a convenient scapegoat.  Nvidia cannot face the demand for its 30x0 chips, due to originally not making enough, then being struck by the global chip shortage, and that is not going to be better soon.  Just like every product in huge demand and low supply, it gets scalped to oblivion. AMD's card suffer from the same, although their architecture prevents them from being used for mining.  But popular opinion claims this is caused - and keeps going on- because miners buy them all.   Now, miners usually do it for the money, which means they are predictable. upon a very simple return on investment computation, and a risk vs reward analysis. And, most of all, they use the cards, they do not sell them. Meaning if you can get cards, even at scalping price, it means miners do not get them.  The question is then \"are cards available at scalper prices ?\" and since the answer is \"yes\", it means miners are not a concern. They may have been by the end of last year/start of this one, but it became very risky financially wise to start eth mining past february/march. It did hit an all time high not that long ago... and lost more than 70% of its value in a couple of days, last week.  In the end what most people do now when they buy a 3070 or 3080 is to use them to play / work, and mine when they do not, because it went from highly technical to as simple as making some double clicks. Just ... dont expect making much doing that.  anyway.  Since popular opinion says miners are the cause, and not nvidia for not making sufficient chips, nvidia claims they are doing something to address that issue.  This gives them a few months of tranquility. And then they will probably say miners bypassed their protection as a reason for the scalping to continue.",

    "question": "ELI5 \u201cHot Hands\u201d or other hand warmers - how do they work/ how are they safe?",
    "answer": "There are different types, but one uses sodium acetate dissolved in water. It's a super-saturated solution, meaning that really there is more stuff dissolved in the water than the water would \"like\". So the sodium acetates \"wants\" to start come out of solution and form solid crystals. To start growing a crystal, though, you need a *nucleation site*, some little bit of something that the first sodium acetate molecules can latch onto and then gather into a crystal from there. Without a nucleation site, the sodium acetate stays in its super-saturated solution.  The hand warmer packet contains this solution along with a little strip of metal. If you bend this strip, little bits of metal come off and these provide nucleation sites for the crystals to start growing. This crystallization process is an *exothermic*, i.e. heat-releasing, reaction.  How did the heat get there? Well, to create a super-saturated solution, you need to dissolve the sodium acetate in hot water (which can hold more stuff in solution) and then let it cool. Some of the heat you put in gets stored in the solution - the heat that was necessary to get it super-saturated (in other words, the solution reaction was *endothermic*). When the excess sodium acetate crystallizes, the heat energy stored in the solution is released.  As to why it is safe, you can calculate how much heat energy will be released and thus how  hot the hand warmer will get. So you can ensure that the temperature will be in a safe range. There's no danger of a \"runaway\" reaction since you know exactly how much sodium acetate you dissolved and how much solution you put in the packet.",

    "question": "ELI5: How does an antenna\u2019s shape impact its performance?",
    "answer": "The ideal antenna for one particular wavelength and beam direction is relatively easy to figure out...it's a stick of the right length and right orientation relative to the beam. The challenge is usually that nobody wants infinite sticks, you often don't have room for a stick of the right length, and you don't know what direction the wave is coming from.  If you know that it's all going to come at you mostly in a flat plane, but you don't know what direction, a pole is fine. See: basically every car antenna of the 1900s or all early cell phones. If you can steer the antenna to point at the source that's also fine (see: all those dishes on satellites and ships and news vans...not the dish itself, that's just a \"radio mirror\", but you can steer the actual antenna.   After that, it's all compromises that make the antenna worse at actually picking things up but potentially better at fitting into where you want it. If you can make it bigger enough to overcome the performance degradation enough to come out ahead on shape, you're OK. This is how you can embed antennas in the window glass of your car now, or in the flat panel of your computer, or the edge or back of your phone.   The ideal antenna length scales with wavelength...as we've gone to higher and higher frequencies (smaller wavelengths) antennas also got way smaller.",

Pairs of particles and anti-particles are occasionally produced out of \"nothing\" thanks to quantum weirdness, and then almost-immediately annihilate each other. The net effect on the rest of the universe is thus, usually, nothing.  Now imagine that this happens *riiiight* next to the event horizon of a black hole. If one member of the pair is trapped behind the event horizon and the other member isn't, they can't immediately annihilate each other like they normally would. Instead, the one that *isn't* trapped has managed to graduate to \"real\" existence - and, because There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch, the black hole's mass decreases by the same amount.

    "answer": "It's allowed because it's part of a contract that you sign when you purchase the property. An HOA can't just \"materialize\" and take control of your property.  Typically a developer/builder would create a small community of homes, when you bought a property from them you would have to sign a contract agreeing to their terms. For example that you wouldn't paint the house neon orange or start collected rusted out trash cars on your lawn. Remember, they still have other properties to sell and they don't want you to trash your house and prevent them from getting a good deal selling the other homes. Eventually the builder will sell all the properties and the contract you signed gets handed off into a HOA made up of the owners of the various properties.  Eventually, anyone you sell your home to will have to sign the same contract as part of the purchase of the home. So it's legal because you willingly and freely signed a contract with mutual benefits.

Not all of them support color at all, and many have very limited color (eg, black and white plus red).

    "answer": "As a truck driver, scales usually aren't more than a small inconvinence as long as you planned ahead and checked your axle weights before hitting the road. Being caught overweight can be incredibly expensive and also can put you out of service until you or your company can remedy the situation.   With DOT scales I am mostly concerned about axle weights. Your load may be under maximum payload for the truck but overweight on one or more axles. Interstate scales typically measure each axle group individually. In general weights max 12,000 lbs for the front axle 34,000 lbs for the rear truck axles a 34,000 lbs for the trailer axles (on most trucks). It can get much more complicated with oversize/overweight heavy hauling and other specialized trucks and trailer.   Most trailers have the ability to slide the trailer axles forward and back and trucks usually can slide the 5th wheel to help you distribute the weight properly over all the axles.     I do scale with most loads before hitting the road at the nearest truck stop if the shipper doesn't have one on location. Most truck stops have scales for $10-12 and you can re-weigh for about $2 if you need to adjust the load or truck. Fuel weight must also be taken into consideration.

    "answer": "Can't answer the question though others have, but I do have a story on this -  Here in the UK we have a website called Right Move, which is basically a property listing website. Most estate agents will list on there from a small terrace house to a multi million \u00a3 mansion. A hobby for a surprising number of people (most will admit to doing the same if you mention you do it too) is to look around at really expensive properties, normally when you've bought a lottery ticket and start imagining what might happen if you win.  You can search huge areas, so I'd always look for somewhere with loads of land. Not that bothered about the house, but I always wanted to put on my own festival. I now do run festivals for a living (and I'm still poor) so realised a lottery win wasn't needed, but I digress.  I once found a place in somewhere like Oxfordshire, enormous amount of land, and oddly cheap. Looking at the photos is became weirder - several houses almost laid out like a street, in the middle of this old farmland. Anyone who's familiar with the UK would instantly recognise them as military style housing, just something about the style that gives them away. The usual smattering of farm buildings too, but they were fenced off. Not like quaint English farm fencing, full on Jurassic Park Category A Supermax prison style electric fencing.  Interest piqued, I read more into it - you were forbidden, by law with ongoing inspections by the Department of Health after purchase and continuing indefinitely, to farm and livestock or crops on the land. Ever.  More reading gave the answer - in the 1990s the UK had an outbreak of BSE or \"Mad Cow Disease\" itself a prion disease. There was footage in the news in the late 90s of cattle infected, filmed on a camcorder, footage from several years earlier that had since been declassified - cows struggling to stand, odd gait, basically \"mad\" and in the full throes of BSE. The footage was filmed at this farm - it was a UK government research centre set up to study the crisis, and was no longer needed. The infected animals were killed, incinerated, and the ashes dumped on the land. But it still isn't safe to use for any food production.  Like I say, the crisis was over by then, hence it being decommissioned, but reading further was 10 times worse than the worst horror film ever.  At one point the UK government thought BSE would turn into CJD in humans. Indeed, for a few hundred to date it has, but it has something like a 20 year incubation period, is totally incurable, and one of the worst diseases known to man. But the original fear was that anyone who'd eaten beef in the previous few decades, as in, fucking _everyone_ (vegetarianism being relatively rare in those days and beef being a stable) would develop CJD at some point in the next decade or two. Nevermind Covid, we're talking 28 Days Later type stuff.  Fortunately, for reasons I don't fully understand, but the comments have explained, it didn't happen.",

You could also make sure relevant web pages link to your page as well. The simplest way to do SEO is to make sure the web page does mention any relevant search terms even though the content might not specify everything explicitly. So get out your synonim dictionary and get to work. You do not have to mention these terms directly in the content. You can add them all as a cluster on the end and make them invisible or almost invisible. You may notice web pages often have a bunch of different keywords at the end linking to pages showing other articles with the same keywords. The search engines will look at those as if they were actual useful links. In addition there is a hidden metadata field in the HTML header which is explicitly for search engine optimization and allows you to put a bunch of relevant search terms in there to help out the search engines point people to your site.  In general SEO is a big and complex industry. It is often a war between the search engines trying to give their users relevant content and the SEO companies trying to promote their content.

So the short and simple of it is that any of the 4 chambers could be inflamed at any given time causing the 'stuffy nose' symptom in one or both nostrils. But, your body is pretty good about making sure you keep breathing (unless you have sleep apnea) so it regulates the erectile tissue in each side of your sinus to usually make sure you can breath out of one of them.   To get a little deeper into it, the process of warming and humidifying the air you're breathing into your lungs through your nose is energy and resource intensive so your body only sends the extra blood to one nostril at a time. But this extra blood causes the tissue to swell (kind of like when you injure your skin and the area around it swells because of the increased blood flow to the injury) and when you're sick you already have increased blood flow to the infection in your sinuses and this increases the stuffiness on the side your body is trying to regulate the air quality in.

But there are a few other ways rich people avoid paying taxes that I haven't seen in this thread yet.  1. Imagine you have a construction business in the US.  You go build something, you get paid $10M, it costs $9M to build the thing, $1M of money flows through to you, you pay US taxes on $1M.  Now imagine that in addition to your construction business in the US, you have a shell company set up in the Cayman Islands.  Your US business gets the contract to go build the thing for $10M.  But now, in scenario 2, your US business hires your Cayman Islands business to do the work.  Your Cayman Islands business charges your US business $9.95M.  Now only $50k flows through to you in the US, and you pay US taxes on the $50k.  Your Cayman Islands business still had to spend $9M on building the thing you got paid $10M to build, so it has $950K left that it earns now as 'corporate profit'.  In the Cayman Islands, that $950K has 0 tax applied to it.  In this scenario, your money is now \"stuck\" in the Cayman Islands.  However, your Cayman Island company that has $950K can buy various things you might be able to make use of (houses, jets, etc.)  Your usage of those things is technically taxable in the US, but it can become hard to enforce. It can also invest the money to make more money, and no taxes would be owned on it until it was distributed to you. 2. Minimize your state tax bill by 'residing' in a 0 state tax state.  There are 9 of them - Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.  Most very rich people have a home in at least one of these states that they claim - rightly or wrongly - is their primary residence.  The Tri-State area (NY, NJ, CT) and California have tried to clamp down on this, but in the end, if you can avoid spending 180 days in those states, you're home free of state tax. 3. Minimize your federal tax bill with loss carry forwards and depreciation expense.  This was a big one for Trump, but is widely used.  Any assets you own, including commercial real estate, you're allowed to depreciate over a 'useful life'.  That depreciation counts as an expense - even though no cash was spent - against the income you pay the federal government.  You can also offset your income with other 'investment' losses, that can sometimes be creatively finagled.  The IRS frowns on 'creativity' like this, and most of it is borderline illegal or completely illegal (but not all - if you invest all your money in GME for fun, you'll be able to write that off eventually), but, enforcement is low since the IRS has such a low enforcement budget. 4. Never realize your profits from investments.  Similar to #1 where a shell company in the Caymans lets you delay realizing profits, there is a tax loophole called the **1031 exchange** which lets you delay realizing assets from property.  It was partly closed in the 2017 tax bill (for all assets other than real estate), but of course was left open for real estate by our real estate developer president.  With 1031, say you bought a house in 2000 to rent out (and you have your Cayman company to manage it, so they keep the profits from rent).  It makes a bunch of money every year, you invest some of the money back to make the house nicer, it still depreciates some giving you some tax write-off, etc.  Fast forward to 2021.  You paid $1M for the house in 2000.  You put $2M of improvements in over the years from rental income.  The market is now red hot, and the house is now worth $10M.  If you did your accounting right, you now have $7M of capital gain ($9M if you didn't).  BUT, if you sell the house and use the money to buy another house or other piece of real estate for $10M, you owe $0 in taxes.  You can get even more creative, and sell your business as a piece of real estate (in certain circumstances) to use this loophole.  For example, I know of a case where a film studio was sold as a real estate transaction.  There was absolutely real estate involved (they needed somewhere to shoot), but part of the value of the 'real estate' was the business that ran within it (including contracts to shoot in the studio, and the studio's reputation or 'good will').  The studio gets sold for $100M or $200M or whatever it was, but it gets called a 'real estate sale'.  The ex-studio owner then had 45 days to identify $100M+ of property to buy - so he bought dozens of houses in a few very hot rental markets.  He avoids paying taxes on his big sale, and now has rental income (which comes with depreciation write offs, and can be directed elsewhere).  &#x200B;  Why can't everyone do the same?  These structures cost money to set up and some require playing games with real estate, which has high barriers to entry.",

    "question": "eli5 How do internal combustion engines work?",
    "answer": "I'd google this to get a picture displaying it, helps to be able to visualize it. Also easier to think about one piston of a four stroke engine.   The crankshaft turns, pulling the connecting rod and piston down the cylinder and the valves on the intake side, fresh air open. The piston moving down the cylinder pulls air into the cylinder.   At the bottom of stroke, the intake valves close, and the piston moves up the cylinder compressing the air it pulled in. In a gas engine the file is sprayed or diffused into the air as it's pulled into the cylinder, in a diesel the fuel is sprayed in when the cylinder is about the top of stroke and the air is compressed. In a gasoline engine you add a spark from a sparkplug, to ignite the gas vapor. In a diesel the heat from compressing the air is enough to ignite the fuel vapor in the cylinder.   Once you light the fuel on fire, it explodes, forcing the piston back down, turning the crankshaft.   As the piston reaches the end of stroke another set of valves in the cylinder head open, these are exhaust valves. They are basically connected to the tail pipe. The piston comes back up, forcing the burn air out of the exhaust side. Near the top of stroke the intake valves open, this let's more exhaust blow out of the cylinder. Then the exhaust valves close and you're back at the start.   You add more cylinders doing the same thing at different times, so that it has more smooth power instead of all of them firing at once. That keeps the crankshaft spinning. You attach a flywheel to the back that is heavy and it will keep momentum going once it's spinning, smoothing out the operation even more. Then you attach whatever you want to run to it.   Can go into more detail or a single component of you want. But that's the basics of it.",

Doing so would also be a safety risk since any malfunction of the device could send more current down your body than is safe.   Instead they use captive sensing. The circuit monitors the capacitance of the blade and when something with high capacitance is added to the blade it can be detected without any significant current passing.

It radiates in all visible colors. And indeed, astronomers have done this, and that is what we see.  But we live on Earth. At the bottom of an ocean of air. That air messes with the light as it passes through.  Have you ever wondered why the sky is blue? Air particles like to scatter light. Knock it off its direct path and send it careening off in a new random direction. But it likes to do this to bluish light more than the other colors. That bluish light that gets knocked off course  in random parts of the sky may be sent on a path that hits your eye. Since that is how you detect blue things, the sky looks blue.  That blue light had to come from somewhere, though. Direct sunlight going into your eye has this happening to it, too. But instead of light going a random direction having the bluish parts knocked in your direction, we have the opposite. Direct sunlight is having the bluish colors knocked away. The light that finally reaches you will be slightly blue light depleted, making the sun appear somewhat yellowish.  At sunrise and sunset, the sun is clipping your part of the earth at a low angle, meaning its light has to pass through way more air. This depletes the blue light even more, to the point where the sun becomes orange, then red. The sky around it stirs that color together with the blue to create those stunning pinks and fuchsias.

    "question": "ELI5: what is the European Super League and why does everyone hate it?",
    "answer": "Let me try and explain the European club football pyramid:  First, the most important point: All professional football teams in Europe play under the same umbrella, that is called UEFA. UEFA runs the highest club competition in Europe, called the UEFA Champions League, whose winner is the European champion. The teams that will play in any given year's Champions League are the previous year's winners of the national leagues of European nations.  Oh, yes, the national leagues: Parallel to the Champions League, every nation also has its own leagues. England has its own, called the Premier League, my country Turkey has the S\u00fcper Lig, etc. The qualification process varies by country depending on that country's teams' previous performance, but by winning the national league, any team in any given European country could go and get to play in the Champions League, and win it and become the European champions if they are good enough.  Each nation has lower divisions of their leagues too, but those divisions are all interconnected with the top division. At the end of each season, the top teams in lower divisions switch places with the bottom teams in the higher division, a process known as 'promotion and relegation'. This ensures that, if I and a bunch of my friends decided to form a team in our Turkish town tomorrow, after enough victories in the following years, we could theoretically get promoted to the Turkish S\u00fcper Lig, win that, go to the Champions League, win that, and become the European champions. Improbable, sure, but theoretically not impossible. By winning enough games for a long enough time, any team could win the Champions League.  Every other continent also has a similar system to determine their continental champion. Every year, the winners from all 6 continents play in the  FIFA Club World Cup. The winner is crowned the world champion.  Now these 12 rich teams owned by bastards have decided to bypass this whole system by creating their own league in place of the Champions League. They seem to like the American system of 'closed league', where the owners of teams decide who gets to play, where even after years of horrendous performance you just continue to be part of the competition, where new teams (which are referred to as 'franchises', ugh) have to ask for permission from the league to be part of it.  This would make the entirety of European leagues pointless. Sure, the national leagues would continue to exist, but with no way of joining this 'Super League' besides invitation, and no way for the 'founding clubs' to ever not qualify for it, pretty much all the excitement of European football is being stolen.",

    "answer": "Spiders don't think, they're just the result of millions of years of spiders with the best habits having the best chance of reproduction. For wheel web spiders, the basic concept is pretty simple really.  Flying insects essentially ride airstreams like a surfer rides waves. That means the best place for a web is across some sort of airflow.  Luckily there's a really easy way to achieve that. The spider starts by letting out an initial guideline in the draft until the airflow picks it up and the end of the line sticks somewhere. When that happens the spider will cut the end of the line it was letting out and attach it where it's sitting. Presto, the spider now has a line crossing a gap.  Now the spider just has to cross that line to create a number of spokes and then create the connecting lines between the spokes.  Spiders can do this pretty quickly really. A very productive web will be repaired and cleaned but an unproductive web will often just be abandoned if it breaks or clutters up. This means that every night, a lot of spiders are trying their luck by building a web someplace new. Most spiderwebs last a few days at best.  And while spiders had millions of years to evolve these clever webs from humble beginnings, the first bicycle appeared only 204 years ago. Spiders really can't conceptualise the notion that a giant will show up to ride a piece of terrain down the street.",

    "question": "ELI5 how does the IRS \"wash rule\" work?",
    "answer": "Put simply, the wash sale rule prohibits an investor from claiming a capital loss for tax purposes if they repurchase the stock or security within 30 days.1  Specifically, the IRS deems a transaction a wash sale if the investor does the following 30 days before or after a sale:  1. Purchases the same investment 2. Purchases a substantially similar investment 3. Enters into a contract to buy a similar investment 4. Acquires a similar stock for an IRA or Roth IRA  An Example  Imagine an investor unfortunate enough to purchase Lucent Technology stock when it was trading upwards of $70 per share. Over subsequent years before the firm disappeared through mergers and acquisitions, that investor watched accounting scandals, financial trouble, and sales meltdowns wipe the share price down to $1.3  Ever the enterprising baron, our investor realizes that if they sell their shares, they can report a capital loss and lower their tax burden. The problem? They believe that Lucent, or the firm that ultimately owns it, will rise from the ashes and return some of the market value which it has lost.  Suddenly, our investor gets a brilliant idea. During the last week of December, they call their broker with instructions to sell their shares in the telecom equipment supplier, locking in the capital loss. Three weeks later, during the first half of January, they ask their broker to repurchase those shares of Lucent. All is well in the world; they locked in the capital loss while holding onto the shares. Seems ingenious, right?  The wash sale rule, as you remember, does not allow an investor to claim a capital loss if they repurchase the investment within 30 days. In other words, unless the investor waits until the 30-day period has elapsed, they will not be able to write the off the loss.  There are ways around this, but let us assume the guy in the article didn't do that.  He sells his shares down at $1 in December, buys them back in the next year at nearly the same price, and the stock goes back up.  His 2019 taxes say he lost $5,000,000 and he got an $800,000 tax break, but in 2020, they went up to a total of $5,045,000 ($45,000 profit), but he gets penalized for the wash sale, and has to pay back the $800,000",

    "answer": "The one of the most important things to think about when designing a prosthetic (after safety) is how you are going to control it. It might initially seem like, \"we have things like bluetooth, so why is this hard?\" but think about where that signal is coming from in the first place. One of the simplest ways we did prosthetics was by coupling it to motion of another joint. For instance, if you raise your shoulder, your hand closes. Lower your shoulder again and it opens. Obviously, this is very mechanical.   For more advanced methods, we can look at the nerves in your arm. There are three main nerves, but each of these give off branches to different muscles, and we aren't skilled enough to directly measure signals going directly to all ~25 muscles in the forearm and hand. One thing we can do, though, is cheat. Instead of looking for a small nerve, we can put a chip in the region of your brain that sends signals to the hand. The problem here is that we still can't pinpoint a signal. We can train you to use it better, but it is like learning to walk all over again... with the extra difficulty of your muscles don't work properly.  So what is the absolute easiest way to deal with all of these problems? Simple - limit the function of the hand. While we can't get each nerve signal, we can measure signals in the larger nerves. Your hand wont have the dexterity of a slight-of-hand artist, but we can restore *some* of the lost function, which is preferable to none.",

    "answer": "Your computer keeps track of its files via a *file system*. The exact details vary, but basically, it's a system that keeps track of which files are where. When you want to save a new text document, the file system takes that command from your text editor and says \"OK, I need to allocate 200 kB for this text document. Where's the best place to do that?\" Once it picks a place to save the file, it takes the information and puts it on the storage device (like, a tiny physical piece of the hard drive or other storage the information will reside on). It keeps a record that file <x> is located at position <y>. When you want to open that file again, your text editor tells the file system \"hey, I want this text document\" and the file system looks in its record book to see where that's located, and tells the storage to return the information stored there. If you add up the sizes of all the files that are written down in that record book, that's how much disk space you're using.  When you delete a file through a normal way (like the OS delete interface), it doesn't generally actually go back and erase the information stored on the physical hard drive. There's no need to do that, and it would take time - a lot of time for big files. Instead, all it does is tell the file system to erase the record of where that file is stored. That means that in the future, the file system doesn't know there's information there and can pick that area to store other information - a new file. This is much faster. But it does mean that until and unless a new file is written to that physical location, the information is still there.",

On the other hand, moderate-high intensity cardio exercise is typically seen to lead to improved blood flow efficiencies along with a stronger heart and indicators of increased performance metrics such as improved VO2max which has shown to lead to a higher quality of life.  Both types of exercise have benefits such as improved glucose (sugar) uptake which helps with diseases such as diabetes, has shown to have mental health and motivational benefits, and combats obesity which is related to other diseases.

That sensation is electric impulses traveling from neuron to neuron in a specific, complex network that your brain accepts and registers as \u201cpink\u201d. However, during the travel of the electric impulse, your neurons release certain chemicals, and those chemicals need to be restored. This is known as \u201creuptake.\u201d  Thus, when you first think \u201cpink,\u201d all the neurons used to create that thought are all strong and ready to give you a nice, strong, comprehensive, and clear idea of pink. However, after immediately triggering those neurons over and over and over, while your neurons are still in the reuptake process, they get, \u201ctired out\u201d in a way, and aren\u2019t all able to perform as expected.   Duly note; neurons firing is like a gun firing; they either do or don\u2019t. They can\u2019t half fire and create a weak image.

With the start of the Renaissance a trend of imitating and studying old Rome became fashionable, often studying translations or original Classical books collected by Islamic scholars, plenty in Cordoba.  Now, the fact that the centers of development transfer to Europe is another story, but the Neoclassical is a companion to modernity and it's a fabrication of a supposed heritage. For most of history Europe was a left-over of the centers of knowledge of Al-Andalus, the Maghreb, and the Levant. Most similarities with Rome are later additions to make ourselves heirs of that.

At first, they were arbitrary, then people bumped into problems. Like, the foot - presume our feet are different lengths... I can go even earlier with the cubit, supposedly the length from your elbow to your finger tip. Can you see a problem here?  So the second was first a division of a day. Then it was a fraction of a solar day. Then it was defined by a fraction of a year, because our orbit around the sun is more stable than our rotation about our axis. A lot changed starting in the 1940s with the quartz clock.  But the thing is, we had, for a long, long time, a pretty much agreed upon definition for what a second was, if not imperfect. So if you're going to invent an atomic clock, or any device that is really, really accurate at counting divisions of time, then you're going to want to fit it to peoples expectations. They back-fit the definition to what was approximately a second, since a second prior was always approximate anyway.  But it's really hard to define a \"base\" unit of time. What is the smallest unit of time that there can be? The smallest unit of time that can be measured? We don't actually know.

This means it can form complex and stable molecules.  The other contender is Silicon. It can also form 4 bonds, and is *much* more abundant on earth. But the first bond it forms is strong than the fourth, and it bonds more strongly with certain elements. So Carbon is just a more flexible building block.",

When writing a problem out through text (typing on a computer, calculator, any computational device), writing it out as OP has it shown will undoubtedly give an answer as 9. The only way you will get it as 1 is to type it out in text form as 6\u00f7(2(1+2)). Parentheses ARE the key thing in understanding an equation. It's not ambiguous at all.  Writing it out on a piece of paper like  6  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  2(1+2)  will result in 1, because you ALWAYS do the math of the numerators and denominators first as if they were in parentheses.

    "answer": "In the comments, you're asking a different question. It's not nice to ask a question, then follow up comments with the real question. It wastes time. What you're really asking is something like:  \"If COVID is spreading, how come the flu is not?\"  The first answer is that this year, due to COVID, people are more afraid of the flu than usual. So more people got flu vaccinations than usual. So the flu is at a disadvantage compared to COVID because people are already prepared for it.  The rest involves thinking about how a disease spreads and some fairly complicated science involving how infections spread. While we understand a lot about how most flu viruses spread, COVID is still relatively new and we haven't answered all of the questions for it yet.  These are the reasons I see a lot of articles choosing to answer this question, keeping in mind that there are a lot of different flu viruses and thus some don't follow these rules:  * Most people already have some flu antibodies, so if the flu viruses in the wild this season are similar to previous seasons, we're already at some percentage of natural immunity. * COVID is already infecting many people, where other flu viruses had to start from zero. COVID started infecting us before we were prepared for it, and now that we're trying to take precautions against COVID it's hard for a new virus to get a foothold. * We think COVID \"fits\" in smaller saliva particles and stays \"alive\" in them longer than many flu viruses. That makes it easier to catch COVID than a normal flu.  * We are testing, but haven't concluded, that you can get sick from inhaling fewer COVID virus particles than many other flu viruses. Think of this like people getting drunk: some kinds of liquor will make a person drunk from a shot or two, but people can drink pints of others. * COVID has an above-average time between when you are contagious and when you present symptoms when compared to other flu viruses. That means people sick with COVID find out later and can infect more people before they isolate.   All in all, the answer is just \"COVID is more contagious\" combined with \"it's already here\". We think if we put a contagious person next to 10 healthy people, the 10 healthy people are more likely to get COVID than the average flu virus. So if a mask has something like a 60% rate of protection, but the normal flu has a lower rate of infection to begin with, it follows that the mask is even better at preventing the normal flu than COVID.  The important thing to learn is: we could make EVERY flu season this way if we'd wear masks and try not to stay too close together in flu season.",

He was 100% an addict and the reason he was cutting was he was taking his \"pure\" heroin he received, holding a large percentage back for his own use, and selling the stomped on product as \"pure.\"   Problem was his supplier had the same ideas and used **carfentanil** to cut it before passing it down to be sold. My friend does his usual and shoots up a hero dose and the rest is in the obituary. [Picture](https://imgur.com/a/drk74iJ) reference for how small of an amount of these synthetic opioids is considered a lethal dose.  **Edit:** Because jesus, didn't expect this to blow up.  To clarify, friend in question was my half brother, who unfortunately got me on drugs in the first place. I've personally been clean since 92.  He started off slinging pot for the mexican mafia back in the late 70's and branched off to coke and speed in the 80's. The wake up call (for me) was when he got shot in the head during a bad deal and managed to live. (The bullet skidded off his skull and bounced around in his sinus cavity before exiting by his eye.)  I'd like to say he turned his life around at that point, but he didn't. We fell out after he started using what he was supposed to sell. (Found this out when people showed up at my moms house and held a gun to her during a family dinner.) He pops up every 5-6 years \"clean\" and we catch-up just for him to disappear again. Last time he popped up around 2013 was when he tried to recruit me into his scheme and basically laid it all out. He was dead within the year.

    "answer": "There are two answers. Neither of them very clear. One personally, and two society-wise. Both depend on risk. The first to your self , the second as a group.   Your risk is based on how likely you are to actually cross paths with someone infectious and how likely that is to cause you serious harm. So are you in an at risk group and where are you are considerations.   The second - how likely you are to be part of a chain of infection, how at risk are the people around you and how well society - such as the health service is coping.   Masks not perfect and life always holds a risk. In the West we have never masked up for flu which kills thousands of people a year - around 20,000 in the U.K. annually I think - though we vaccinate the at risk. Possibly COVId may have some nasty long term consequences even if you dint get seriously ill. But if the consequences of COVID dropped to equivalent to flu , then it would hardly be unreasonable to behave in a similar way. I say that nit to suggest we wait till then ( if it ever happened) but as a comparative starting point. No one can really say at what precise point in infections and consequences between that \u2018flu\u2019 point and the worst of COVID is the point at which we are \u2018safe\u2019.   I expect government ps will come up with a balance of infection rates, hospitalisations and economics with a dose of politics.   Bear in mind that in the East people regularly wear masks on public transport so as either not to do catch viruses or not to spread them , I guess it\u2019s just considered normal hygiene even for colds.   That\u2019s a long winded way of saying that presuming you are not mandated by the governments and pretty much everyone has had access to a vaccine you will have to decide whether you feel either at risk yourself, or feel that you need to still protect other people.

These people were hired to wake up early and go around town with a long pole, knocking on windows to wake them up!  Another method was to stick a nail into a candle that burned at a known rate. When the candle burned down to the nail it would fall onto a metal plate with a clatter, waking the sleeper. If you were particularly difficult to wake the nail could be replaced with a fuse to a charge of gunpowder. That would definitely wake you, or your neighbor would in short order!

    "answer": "Well, we don't sense absolute temperature. What we sense is the transfer of energy/heat. When we are warmer than our surroundings, our heat leaves our body and that feels colder. When our surroundings are warmer than us, heat transfers to us and we feel warmer.  Different materials have different capacities for heat, and also rates of transfer. Air can't hold as much heat energy, and it is also more of an insulator, so we hold on to our heat better.  But water will transfer heat much better, so even though 30C water is warmer than 25C air, we are warmer than both of those, and water transfers it better. So we sense more energy leaving our body into the water, thus is feels colder.  Same as feeling room temperature wood, or room temperature copper.

    "answer": "My GF was the consultant in charge of the project to explain to parents in CA why the change to Common Core was happening, help them understand the how and why behind what was being done, and to give them the tools to help their children with it.  Common Core was designed with a goal: to significantly increase the number of students graduating high school with the higher math knowledge such as basic Calculus, Trigonometry, etc.  that previously only a small percentage of the students managed during their high school education.  In the process of figuring out how to do this it became apparent that a lot of the traditional way that math concepts were presented and taught starting in Kindergarten and continuing in the primary school years were at best not optimal, and at worst actually counter-productive once students had to make transitions beyond arithmetic. This resulted in the creation of a unified curriculum of study that planned the whole set of goals, grade by grade, and how it was presented with this goal in mind.  They way that initial arithmetic is taught in Kindergarten is done with the goal of making sure that the math is taught not just to get whatever concept is currently being taught into their brains, but to always be focused on what they are going to have to learn down the road and lay the foundation for that.  One thing that stuck in my head while talking to my GF about it was that she noted how it become apparent how important it was to get the parents to understand that Common Core needed to be viewed as a 13 year process starting in Kindergarten and coming to fruition when their child graduated the 12th grade.  The standards were introduced in CA in 2014-15 school year, this means that the first class of students who will graduate having been taught by this method for their entire public school education will be the class of 2028.

    "answer": "Datastore: a digital place where you store data.  This can be a database or even something as simple as a file.  Database: a datastore with formally defined operations for creating, requesting, updating and deleting data.  Databases come in a variety of flavors.  Relational database: a database that not only stores data, but also stores the relations of that data.  Data is generally stored in tables with rows and columns.  The columns of the table generally describe the schema, or shape, of the data.  The rows of the table generally represent individual records of the table.  Tables can be linked or related to each other with \"foreign keys\".  For example, an \"Order\" table might have a \"CustomerId\" column which is a foreign key for the \"Customer\" table, which relates the Order and Customer tables together.  This gives you an incredible amount of flexibility in how you can query your data, as you can choose to join the two tables together on the foreign key and filter your data by any column from any of your joined tables.  Nonrelational database: a database that avoids storing relational data.  These are also known as \"NoSQL\" databases.  These databases are generally much faster than relational databases, but come with the downside that querying data is much less flexible.  It is still possible to relate data in a nonrelational database but it requires special consideration ahead of time to carefully design how your data will be indexed, partitioned and sorted.",

CRT seeks to approach race and racism as systemic issues, rather than the actions of individual people or groups. 2. There is lively debate both inside and outside of the academic community on CRT and how the issues should be addressed. 3. Yes and no. CRT presents a framework for working on the problem and building solutions. It does not present a \"This is how to solve racism\" checklist, and that isn't the intent. 4. White people can and should be active participants in discussions within CRT. The social and cultural systems addressed by CRT as sources of racism also impact other groups like women, LGBTQ+ people, people with disabilities, etc.",

    "answer": "There's a lot of hardware that you'll pass through, and most of it you have no way of even knowing.  You can only find out *approximately* how many routers your packet touches on the way to its destination because of a fancy hack of setting the TTL to various incrementing values(which decrements with each router until it reaches 0 to prevent routing loops), and getting TTL Expiry messages back from the router that sent them.  However, that doesn't even tell you the number of routers, since technologies like MPLS let a service provider create a pseudo-routing-shortcut through their network from one edge to another, which can bypass the TTL mechanism in the intermediary steps.  Then you have various switches and signal boosters along the way, which are also going to be transparent.   At the same time, you could be going through \"virtual\" devices. You could have a packet go into a Layer 3 Switch on one Virtual LAN (VLAN), which passes between two Layer 3 Routers within the switch, and then out another VLAN on the switch.

We can make devices that count the number of times the crystal has vibrated. So if the crystal is one that vibrates roughly 16,000 times per second, we can connect that counter to a device that counts up to 16,000 then sends a signal. Every signal represents 1 second passing. Now that we have a device that can count seconds (or fractions of a second), we can make a clock! (This is how digital watches work!)  So basically DSLRs and computers have tiny digital watches inside without a screen.   This isn't always super accurate. Cheaper crystals and mechanisms aren't exactly perfect. If I leave my Nintendo Switch disconnected from the internet, it's usually 2-3 minutes off of the \"correct\" time within 24 hours.

    "answer": "This is going to be a simplification - feel free to check out [Richard Feynman explain why this is hard to explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn_8):  As an abstract concept, a field is a thing that has a specific value at every point in space. For one such example, there is a field that describes the distance in inches everywhere in the universe from a cup of coffee. This field varies as cups of coffee are created, consumed, or moved around. While this may seem contrived, it still meets the criteria to be a \"scalar\" field - a field with a single number at each. One such real field like this is the Higgs Field - related to describing the distribution of mass in the universe.   Fields can also have multiple values at every point, for example in 3d space this could be a direction. The gravitational field is one of these, every point in the universe has some direction that gravity would pull on a small mass at that point. Fields are useful tools because often they can exert forces on the things that interact with them - just how a one mass is pulled towards another because their interactions with the gravitational field.   The magnetic field is just another vector field where the value at each point encodes the direction and strength of the push on an object that interacts with the magnetic field - such as moving charged particles, electric currents, or magnetic objects. When we say that an object has \"a magnetic field\", we mean that this object influences the values at all the points in the magnetic field near the object where a stronger magnet changes the values more.  The magnetic field is especially interesting because its relationship with the electric field, as changes in the magnetic field cause changes in the electric field (the direction/strength of forces on static charged particles) and vice versa, a principle that makes generating electricity possible.",

The problem is that I can read a chapter and have no idea what I read. You could take the book away from me, ask me about some really important details, like a character's name, and I'd have no idea.   It's really frustrating to and it's why I don't read much.  When I'm reading, my eyes are scanning the words, I know the words make their way into my brain but since I'm usually day dreaming at the same time, the words from the book don't get processed. I don't know where they go, but it's not into my brain. The result is that when I notice myself doing it, I have to go back and start from the last thing I remember which usually means reading the same few pages or the same chapter multiple times.   I'd suggest comparing it trying to read with music playing, but I think more people than I realize can do that just fine. Personally, I can't.

    "question": "ELI5: What is \"Ray Tracing\" in a video game, and how does it differ from previously made reflections?",
    "answer": "Yes, that's precisely it, in a sense.  Games run at very fast speeds, often times more than 60 frames per second. That means, the GPU has less than 16.66ms to render one frame at 1920x1080 resolution, or the game will start to dip below 60 FPS.  Now, have you heard the commonly circulated internet fact that a single frame of Frozen took a week to render? So how do we do that, but in 16ms? The answer is that engineers created \"hacky\" ways to render your game that are in no way physically accurate, but will produce okay-ish results really quickly.  One of the most difficult things to simulate with these \"fake\" methods are reflections. Because well, reflections are inherently a byproduct of realism. Light bouncing around multiple times makes things reflect off each other. We certainly cannot afford to do that kind of processing, otherwise it would take longer to render the frame, and we don't want to play games with the FPS of a slide show.  But the engineers are smart, so they created special methods to once again \"fake\" the reflections. For example, [cube maps](https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced/cubemaps_skybox.png)! These work by pre-rendering beforehand the reflection of the world around the object, and then drawing a texture based on that rendering. So, when you play the game, it's simply just drawing a texture, not rendering multiple bouncing light rays. The downside of this method is that it does not allow dynamic reflections, because the textures are already pre-rendered beforehand and cannot change.  With ray tracing, like the name implies, games are able to draw light rays (simulating light bouncing) more realistically, and hence draw real time reflections and such, but without much more effort. This can be done with the help of the novel RT cores that Nvidia developed in their 2xxx and 3xxx cards.",

    "answer": "Inflammatory pain/everyday pain: NSAIDs, typically ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve) are most common. Can cause problems such as ulcers, bleeding, and kidney problems.  Everyday pain (particularly in elderly) : acetaminophen/paracetamol (Tylenol). Can be hard on the liver.  Arthritis pain: when the OTC pain killers don't cut it, other NSAIDs such as meloxicam (Mobic) or celecoxib (Celebrex) can be used. Easier on the stomach, harder on the heart.  More intense pain: injectable NSAIDs like ketorolac (Toradol) (really hard on kidneys) or opioids.   Nerve pain: not many great options, but gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), and a class of antidepressants called SNRIs (duloxetine and venlafaxine are the parent molecules) can be used. Methadone has also been useful in certain cases.   Centralized pain: this is a weird kind of pain where there isn't necessarily anything wrong, but you've been in pain so long that the pain center of your brain misfires and tells you you're in pain. Very hard to treat, but treatment is similar to nerve pain.   Migraines: NSAIDs can be used OTC. Generally people need something stronger and will be prescribed a triptan (sumatriptan, rizatriptan, etc.). There are a bunch of new and interesting drugs that just came out that treat and prevent migraines.   Tension headaches: A mix of an NSAID or acetaminophen, caffeine, and phenobarbital.   Cancer pain: generally opioids. Can step down if the pain isn't too bad.   Bone pain (usually associated with bone cancer, chemo, or bone marrow transplant): can use zoledronic acid and/or an antihistamine like Claritin or Zyrtec. This is generally in addition to opioids or NSAIDs.   These are the ones I can come up with off the top of my head. It's been awhile since my palliative care and pain management rotation.",

Columbus claimed that the sea distance from Spain to China was far, far less than it really would have been had the Americas not been there because he believed the Earth was far smaller than it really is.  People knew the Earth was round and had a pretty good idea just how bit it was, it was estimated pretty accurately in Ancient Greek times, and they knew Columbus' idea of how far it would be to China was ludicrously short, meaning the amount of food and water he could pack into his ships would run out a fraction of the way there, and then everyone would starve.  By dumb luck it turned out the Caribbean islands that Columbus arrived at happened to be about the same distance from Spain as his false calculations indicated China would be.  In the case of John Cabot, the first to make the crossing in the North Atlantic, European fishermen were already at that time sailing out the Grand Banks to go fishing, and there was a degree of anecdotal belief amongst the fishing community that there was land there, as things like weather patterns were consistent with the presence of land, so even though nobody had yet been there, they had a pretty decent idea that there would be land to be found.

This is not an ideal thing because everything wants to be at the lowest energy level it can be relative to the environment. For ATP this means it really wants to jettison off one phosphate group and become ADP. It needs a little help doing this, and will give off a decent amount of energy  in doing so. When a chemical reaction uses ATP as fuel, the energy released by helping it lower to a more stable compound is used to do *work*.

    "answer": "When a nuclear weapon goes off it releases a huge amount of UV/Xrays/Gamma rays which move outward and smack into electrons of air molecules with enough energy to knock them loose and send the electrons flying.  This huge and sudden current of electrons quickly moving away from the center point creates a suddenly changing magnetic field.  We use this feature in transformers and wireless chargers.  If you change a current it creates a changing magnetic field which can be coupled into a nearby wire to create a current in that wire so you can pass power wirelessly.  For nuclear EMPs \"nearby\" is hundreds of miles away and the changing magnetic field is insanely strong.  The US did a test called [Starfish Prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_Prime) where they detonated a nuke about 400 km up(roughly the height of the space station which didn't exist yet).     Starfish Prime ended up creating a field over Hawaii (900 miles away) that was 5600 Volts/meter which means a 10 meter long power line would generate 56,000 volts at the end of it.  This is pretty bad for power lines and blew out a few hundred streetlights, but it was really before the era of microelectronics.  A 5mm long trace in your smart phone would have experienced 28 volts which is pretty devastating to a system expecting to run at less than 5 volts.

Those water molecules were only supposed to attach lipids to oils and go away.   So all molecules do mostly 3 things (yes I know plasma but this is eli5). When they get cold, they cuddle together to try and stay warmer.  When they are too hot, they get bored and fly up north to try and cool down. But when the temperature is *just right* (like Goldilocks) they like to go out and play ! These are called phases, and just like a teenager, they are subject to change at any given notice. They just need the right motivation to be in a different phase.  Back to laundry. So we now understand that these water molecules soaking our clothes are happy to be there. It's just right out. So we can motivate our molecules to go away by increasing the temperature.   It doesn't matter whether the object gets wet or not. Water is always trying to make the temperature *just right* by either cuddling together and waiting it out. Or just flying away until it's time to play!

    "answer": "Yes, that's precisely it, in a sense.  Games run at very fast speeds, often times more than 60 frames per second. That means, the GPU has less than 16.66ms to render one frame at 1920x1080 resolution, or the game will start to dip below 60 FPS.  Now, have you heard the commonly circulated internet fact that a single frame of Frozen took a week to render? So how do we do that, but in 16ms? The answer is that engineers created \"hacky\" ways to render your game that are in no way physically accurate, but will produce okay-ish results really quickly.  One of the most difficult things to simulate with these \"fake\" methods are reflections. Because well, reflections are inherently a byproduct of realism. Light bouncing around multiple times makes things reflect off each other. We certainly cannot afford to do that kind of processing, otherwise it would take longer to render the frame, and we don't want to play games with the FPS of a slide show.  But the engineers are smart, so they created special methods to once again \"fake\" the reflections. For example, [cube maps](https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced/cubemaps_skybox.png)! These work by pre-rendering beforehand the reflection of the world around the object, and then drawing a texture based on that rendering. So, when you play the game, it's simply just drawing a texture, not rendering multiple bouncing light rays. The downside of this method is that it does not allow dynamic reflections, because the textures are already pre-rendered beforehand and cannot change.  With ray tracing, like the name implies, games are able to draw light rays (simulating light bouncing) more realistically, and hence draw real time reflections and such, but without much more effort. This can be done with the help of the novel RT cores that Nvidia developed in their 2xxx and 3xxx cards.",

But regardless yes it is more difficult than a car:  Controls: Steering is far more like a boat than like car only you have elevation as well. I'm sure other redditors will go into greater detail but your controls are far more complex and if you are relying on the auto pilot you need to understand how to read and program that specific autopilot exactly. You can't learn to fly a Boeing 737-400 and then go fly a Boeing 737-800 - you'd have to go specifically retrain (Boeing 737NG course).  Navigation: In a car you are driving on a road with road markings and road signs and nowadays with extremely an useful GPS lady to guide you along. A huge part of flying is navigating as there's no signs up in the air to guide you along. And with weather conditions you have to learn to navigate by instrumentation alone.  Radio: This is the reason I could never be a pilot - I do not understand what is being said over the radio and you cannot fly safely without having proper communication and radio discipline. You have to be listening closely at **all** times because there's no way to fly safely without listening out for air traffic control constantly.  Safety: If your aircraft experiences any problem in air you can't simple pull over and open the hood. Therefore every single of aspect of flying involves safety checks and doublechecks.

    "answer": "Spiders don't think, they're just the result of millions of years of spiders with the best habits having the best chance of reproduction. For wheel web spiders, the basic concept is pretty simple really.  Flying insects essentially ride airstreams like a surfer rides waves. That means the best place for a web is across some sort of airflow.  Luckily there's a really easy way to achieve that. The spider starts by letting out an initial guideline in the draft until the airflow picks it up and the end of the line sticks somewhere. When that happens the spider will cut the end of the line it was letting out and attach it where it's sitting. Presto, the spider now has a line crossing a gap.  Now the spider just has to cross that line to create a number of spokes and then create the connecting lines between the spokes.  Spiders can do this pretty quickly really. A very productive web will be repaired and cleaned but an unproductive web will often just be abandoned if it breaks or clutters up. This means that every night, a lot of spiders are trying their luck by building a web someplace new. Most spiderwebs last a few days at best.  And while spiders had millions of years to evolve these clever webs from humble beginnings, the first bicycle appeared only 204 years ago. Spiders really can't conceptualise the notion that a giant will show up to ride a piece of terrain down the street.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why do video games look better towards the end of a console\u2019s life?",
    "answer": "The answer to this has changed over time, and so has the degree of difference: a late 360 game still looks better than an early 360 game, but not to remotely the same degree that a late NES game looks better than an early NES game.  To some extent, it really is a matter of developers learning to use the hardware more effectively. This is a process that never really stops, and it leads to incremental improvement over time, to a limited degree.  But you mentioned how Sony and Microsoft released hardware upgrades for the PS4 and XBone, and this leads to the other big reason: hardware upgrades to a cobsole's capabilities are not as new as many people think. The main difference is that with disc and digital consoles, these upgrades generally require you to buy a new console or at least swap out bits of the hardware: you can't put more RAM on a disc or download a better video processor.  But on the older cartridge-based systems, hardware upgrades were often built into the games themselves. The NES is especially notorious for its proliferation of different kinds of upgrade chips. Nintendo called most of its upgrades Memory Management Controllers (MMCs), but in a more general sense people call them mappers now. There were limits to what a mapper could do -an NES is still an NES- but these were used to enhance memory, add features like split-screen and larger sprites, and on the Famicom it was even possible to enhance the games' sound (this last didn't work on the NES because of some foolish early decisions on NOA's part). The SNES had its own mappers, as did the Game Boy and the Genesis, but nothing else ever took them to the degree that the NES did.",

    "answer": "Eh, \"processed foods\" is a bit of a boogie man in the health food market. There's not really one singular definition for \"processed\" that everyone can agree on, so it can be really hard to say that it does or doesn't have a direct health impact.   That said, three of the things that a lot of processed foods have in common is that they are easy to get, easy to prep, and easy to eat a lot of. They stay stable on store and warehouse shelves for longer, so they tend to be cheaper and in stock more often. A lot of the challenging prep work like the gardening, cutting, and cooking are done for you, making it easy. They also tend to have a lot of the extra food removed during the manufacturing process, so they are more calorie dense per bite.   Sugar is the big deal in my opinion. We consume so much more sugar these days than we used too. Candy, soda, sugar filled \"low fat\" options, \"health foods\" like granola that are packed with sugar, etc...  Combine those factors, and you've got people doing less work to eat denser foods. Thats going to result in weight gain, no matter how healthy or unhealthy the individual foods are.",

You HOPE that the price lowers so you can pocket the difference. Example: If you borrow a stock from me, and sell for \u00a310, you want the price to lower. That way when the time comes to return it back to me, you buy it for the lower price of \u00a35, give it back to me, and you pocket the extra \u00a35.  To quickly go into what happened with GME, the hedgefunds borrowed ALL THE STOCKS that exists, AND THEN MORE STOCKS on top of that, thinking that the price of GME was gonna drop. In fairness, the Price had been in freefall for years and GameStop has been on its last legs for a long time. Smart people on Reddit noticed this, and brought all the stocks, which pushed the prices up. To translate this into the example: they borrowed and sold for $10 a share (not the correct price), but the price went up to about $300 per share. This put the hedgefunds in deficit by $290 per share (about $6Billion total). They had also borrowed more stocks than actually existed.

    "question": "eli5: Why do cars need gears?",
    "answer": "An engine does not have infinite power or rev ability. It requires more effort to accelerate than to cruise. Lower gears mean that the engine is turning more times (more power) for every time the wheel turns. This gives it the extra oomph to accelerate. But the engine can only rev so high, so more gears are needed to go faster. As you go faster the gear ratio changes meaning the engine is turning less times for every rev of the wheel. This creates efficiency at high cruising speeds for better gas mileage. It only takes about 15 horsepower to keep a car going at speed, while it takes many more ponies to get up to that speed. All that being said, there is a style of transmission known as a continuously variable transmission, which doesn't change gears so much as smoothly changes the ratio as needed while driving, resulting in a smooth acceleration without changing individual gears.",

    "answer": "Datastore: a digital place where you store data.  This can be a database or even something as simple as a file.  Database: a datastore with formally defined operations for creating, requesting, updating and deleting data.  Databases come in a variety of flavors.  Relational database: a database that not only stores data, but also stores the relations of that data.  Data is generally stored in tables with rows and columns.  The columns of the table generally describe the schema, or shape, of the data.  The rows of the table generally represent individual records of the table.  Tables can be linked or related to each other with \"foreign keys\".  For example, an \"Order\" table might have a \"CustomerId\" column which is a foreign key for the \"Customer\" table, which relates the Order and Customer tables together.  This gives you an incredible amount of flexibility in how you can query your data, as you can choose to join the two tables together on the foreign key and filter your data by any column from any of your joined tables.  Nonrelational database: a database that avoids storing relational data.  These are also known as \"NoSQL\" databases.  These databases are generally much faster than relational databases, but come with the downside that querying data is much less flexible.

    "question": "ELi5 Why are stars typically bigger than planets?",
    "answer": "Because this is how we define stars, planets and moons.  For planets and moons this is easy. If planets weren't bigger than their moons they wouldn't be planets. Moons are things that orbit planets. Orbiting is based on relative mass (smaller things orbit bigger things), so if a planet had a moon bigger than it, the planet would be the moon and the moon the planet. If they were similar sizes they'd orbit around each other, and wouldn't count as proper planets - instead being maybe dwarf planets or something similar.  For stars and planets we need to be careful what we mean by \"bigger.\" What makes stars stars and not planets is that they are *massive* enough (so have enough mass) that the are undergoing nuclear fusion. If you get enough mass together in one region, gravity pulls it in hard enough that the stuff starts squishing in awkward ways and explodes. Stars are a balance between gravity imploding the stuff they're made of, and fusion exploding it again.  So generally stars need to be larger in size than planets because - roughly speaking - stars and planets are made up of the same stuff, and if planets were bigger they'd probably have enough mass to start exploding and turn into stars.  That said, you do get some very small stars. Based on [this list of small stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_smallest_stars), around 20 of them are smaller than Jupiter - mostly White Dwarf stars and Neutron Stars. These are incredibly dense - they may have similar amounts of mass to the Sun (so enough mass to undergo fusion and so be stars), but that mass is squished down to an object maybe on a few kilometres across for the smallest.  To quote [Wikipedia's definition of a planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet):  > A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is **not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion,** and ... **has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals**.  Roughly speaking, if a planet is too big and massive, it fails that first highlighted part and becomes a star. If a planet is too small it fails that second highlighted part and becomes a moon, natural satellite, dwarf planet or something else.",

    "answer": "The answer is: we're still trying to get there!  Sugar is easy to find for a few reasons.  1. Sugar is a small molecule who's shape is pretty consistent. This lets us design very effective receptors to interact with it in all environments (temp pH and salt content) The above isn't true for say proteins who's configurations are dependent on their local environment. Thus anything that interacts with them must do so under very controlled conditions. This might require either very specific environmental controls, or tedious preprocessing (preparation steps before measurement)  2. Sugar is relatively abundant to other species in your blood. Sugar exists on the order of magnitude of mmol/L in your blood. This is hundreds to hundreds of thousands of times higher than other relevant biomarkers. This is the difference of trying to measure the weight of a sandwich and the weight of the salt in the meat of the sandwich. The problems simply are not comparable. We also need more blood to be confident we will find something. 3. Diabetes is a massive market that provides financial incentive that has hugely oversaturated the sugar diagnostics market. If you're making a portable sensor, chances are that in the early stages, you're going to need a well known test case to compare your results to. Sugar measurement is a simple initial test. It's low hanging fruit for the reasons listed above. There are tons of comparison points. It's financially viable. Even if your goal is to diagnose cancer, at some point you will likely end up diagnosing sugar concentration.  There's no reason we can't make portable diagnostic devices that can measure protein and DNA concentrations, but it is simply harder to do than it is to measure sugar concentrations.

You could see plenty of pixels on the screen and most of the texture/models were made with it in mind. You had plenty of sharp corners, and bare bone texture because the low resolution would also provide an aesthetic. These sharp edges/corners would have a black edge usually, and with the low resolution, this would help slightly blur the sides. You wouldn't see sharp as much which gave a better look.  For images though, it meant that past a certain distances you didn't have enough pixels to properly render the entire texture. You'd have blobs of colors that were difficult to make sense of.  With higher resolution, you have many more pixels to work with. suddenly the black line don't hide the edges, but on the other hand you have enough to render that entire far away texture.

The reason why others don't do it is energy, and money. \"What you are missing here\" is the sheer amount of water needed and how much that would cost. Let's break it down.  **California consumes 38 billion (**[**38,000,000,000) gallons of water per day**](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2014/08/21/usgs-estimates-vast-amounts-water-used-california/14400333/)**.**  Producing desalinated water has a big cost range depending on the type of plant and how big it is, but it's something like [$2 per 325 gallons.](https://www.wired.com/story/desalination-is-booming-as-cities-run-out-of-water/) Therefore, making enough fresh water for California is going to cost **$233 million** ***per day***\\*.\\*  Oh and you have to build the desalination plants first! A desalination plant that can produce [100 million gallons per day costs $658 million](https://www.twdb.texas.gov/innovativewater/desal/faq.asp). So for California's 38 billion gallons per day, you need to build 380 such mega-plants, which would cost **$250 billion total**. Plus the $233M per day to operate the plants.  Oh and then you have to transport all the fresh water from those 380 plants along the coast to where it's needed. Water is very heavy, so shipping is tough. You either need to move 38 billion gallons a day in train tankers + trucks, or construct thousands of miles of huge-diameter pipelines across the whole state. I don't have numbers there but both options are $$$ once again.   Overall, it's physically possible but just not feasible on the scale needed to actually help a state-wide drought.  There are environmental costs too, since desalination plants using a ton of energy also means they produce a lot of greenhouse gases. Going back to Saudi Arabia example, they estimate 25% of all oil and gas burned in the country is for desalination.  If you have a few minutes and want a pile of easily-understandable info on your exact question, I highly recommend the article [The World Can Make More Water From the Sea, but at What Cost?](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/climate/desalination-water-climate-change.html) by the NY Times.",

    "answer": "Have you ever sat by a lake or river and dug a little hole in the ground? After a while, water will collect in the bottom, because the water flows through dirt and stone around the river too. When it rains, a lot of water flows down into the ground and that ground that carries water is called an aquifer. Depending on what kind of dirt and rocks are there and how the hills and mountains are sloped, it will collect in certain places.   Very ancient people needed water to live, just like we do today. They usually chose to live near rivers, lakes, and streams. They also dug little holes in the ground nearby, and noticed the water in those holes was nice and filtered by the dirt and sand. If they dug a hole and covered it up, their water would taste good and stay clear of leaves, sticks, and algae. So they dug deeper and deeper holes, and found they could move further from lakes and rivers which would flood from time to time.   Where to dig a well was trickier the further you got from water though. Sometimes they dug big holes for nothing, and that was disappointing, but they learned a lot from it. Parents taught their children what to look for, what kinds of rocks and plants made for good well ground.  EDIT: WHOA!!! Glad so many people were amused by writing in my teacher-voice!

Instead of 1 2 3 (3 different numbers) you go 123 (1 number). It puts less stress on the ability to remember and makes you more able to remember more stuff.   Spaced repetition works like this. Say you're doing flashcards. You get 3 right and 1 wrong. You focus on the one you got wrong in each session. It basically just works cause firing the same neural connections over and over, which is how we remember stuff anyway.  Memory palace is a way to remember objects or things. Say you need a red box and a brown spider and a yellow hand. So you literally imagine a room with those things in it and it helps you remember them.

    "answer": "There are different types, but one uses sodium acetate dissolved in water. It's a super-saturated solution, meaning that really there is more stuff dissolved in the water than the water would \"like\". So the sodium acetates \"wants\" to start come out of solution and form solid crystals. To start growing a crystal, though, you need a *nucleation site*, some little bit of something that the first sodium acetate molecules can latch onto and then gather into a crystal from there. Without a nucleation site, the sodium acetate stays in its super-saturated solution.  The hand warmer packet contains this solution along with a little strip of metal. If you bend this strip, little bits of metal come off and these provide nucleation sites for the crystals to start growing. This crystallization process is an *exothermic*, i.e. heat-releasing, reaction.  How did the heat get there? Well, to create a super-saturated solution, you need to dissolve the sodium acetate in hot water (which can hold more stuff in solution) and then let it cool. Some of the heat you put in gets stored in the solution - the heat that was necessary to get it super-saturated (in other words, the solution reaction was *endothermic*). When the excess sodium acetate crystallizes, the heat energy stored in the solution is released.  As to why it is safe, you can calculate how much heat energy will be released and thus how  hot the hand warmer will get. So you can ensure that the temperature will be in a safe range. There's no danger of a \"runaway\" reaction since you know exactly how much sodium acetate you dissolved and how much solution you put in the packet.",

    "question": "ELI5 If time is a dimension, why can you only go in one direction?",
    "answer": "Ok, so this is far from a fully accepted theory, but it *is* a theory, and based off some very well-accepted theories.   In General Relativity, you don\u2019t really \u201cmove\u201d through time. Instead, you *are* at all points in time.   As an example with lower dimensions so we can understand it intuitively, imagine a pen moving left and right. Then, as time progresses, you move the page downward under the pen, leaving a line on that page.   The left/right position of that line on the paper represents the spacial position of the pen, while the up/down position represents the temporal position of the pen.   If you look at a single horizontal slice of that line, and you move the horizontal slice upwards at a steady rate, you will see what *looks* like a point moving left and right, imitating the path that your pen took.   But you know that the horizontal slice giving the motion of the pen is actually only a slice of the full picture. In fact, the ink of the pen makes a full line. It just *exists* in both time and space. It\u2019s not moving, it\u2019s not going forward or backward, it\u2019s just a line sitting there.   The only way to see motion from this line is by only looking at a single moving slice - a single moment in time - at any given instant.   This is what happens in real life. You are a 4-dimensional, static line through spacetime. The reason you seem to move, think, and be dynamic in any way is because you\u2019re experiencing a single slice of time, a single instant in your \u201cworldline\u201d (that\u2019s the real name for it), and that slice of time you experience is moving forward through time at 1 second per second.   Ok, but here\u2019s where it gets really weird.   How do you know that you\u2019re progressing through time? You\u2019re only ever living in the exact present, it\u2019s not like you have a sense that tells you time is passing, so how do you know it is?  Generally, the response is that you remember all the past instants in time, right? That layer of recent memories tells you you\u2019re moving through time, forming new memories.   But (assuming we accept that memories are due to some arrangement of matter in your brain, and not caused by magic or spirits or whatever), there\u2019s absolutely no way for you to differentiate between actually progressing through time and developing new memories, or just being a static entity that can\u2019t move, or do anything, that\u2019s stuck in a single instant in time, but with memories from all the previous instants.   Essentially, the idea is you aren\u2019t moving through time, you\u2019re stuck in this exact moment, but with the *memories* in your brain telling you that you are moving through time.   So now, the question isn\u2019t \u201cwhy are we only moving in one direction through time\u201d because in fact, you aren\u2019t moving through time at all. You\u2019re just a single static slice of your 4-dimensional worldline with the memories making you *think* you\u2019re moving through time. Rather, the question is \u201cwhy do we only remember the past, and not the future\u201d.   And the general idea for that is because of entropy. Let\u2019s pretend that your brain is a watermelon, and you\u2019re trying to remember a hammer that\u2019s coming to smash that watermelon.   Now, theoretically, it\u2019s within the laws of physics for a smashed watermelon to spontaneously bounce off the ground, join together, and throw a hammer into the air. It\u2019s *possible*, but insanely unlikely, because every one of billions of trillions of particles would have to vibrate in exactly the right way at the right time to accomplish that.   On the other hand, it\u2019s *very* likely for a watermelon hit by a hammer to spontaneously smash. That\u2019s something that increases entropy, and you have common sense to realize that would happen.   So, if we see a smashed watermelon, we can pretty easily conclude, \u201chey, a hammer probably hit this\u201d. If we see an *unsmashed* watermelon though, you can\u2019t conclude \u201cthis watermelon probably solidified from many small chunks of watermelon on the ground and threw a hammer into the air\u201d.   In a way, you can say a smashed watermelon \u201cremembers\u201d into the past that it was hit by a hammer.   On the other hand, a solid watermelon can\u2019t \u201cremember\u201d into the future that it *will be* smashed, because the probability that a solid, unsmashed watermelon corresponds to being hit by a hammer in the future is so vanishingly small.   Your brain is basically that watermelon. It can\u2019t remember into the future because it\u2019s so insanely unlikely that a brain affected by the future would somehow reverse every process required to, for example, erase a memory, send the signal back down the optic nerve, causing your cones to yeet out photons into space.   **TL;DR:** *You don\u2019t move through time at all, you\u2019re stuck in time with memory of the past.

So as long as everything you touch is all the same level it won't go through you because there is nowhere for it to go. As long as everything in the ISS is all connected to the frame so that it is all the same level (voltage) you are safe.  This is why if a utility truck touches a power line and a worker gets out and touches the truck (high level/voltage) and the ground (low level/voltage) at the same time the electricity goes through their body and shocks them badly.

The \"dimension\" of something refers to how many pieces of information you need to locate something within a space. You need those four values to precisely identify where and when something is, and so spacetime is (classically, at least) four-dimensional.  The reason time slows down at high speeds is more complicated than it appears on the surface: light *always* travels at the speed of light. The thing is, I really do mean **always** -- no matter how fast you're moving, you will always measure light to be moving away from you at one single speed.  >\"But, what if you're moving forward at one-quarter the speed of light and turn on a flashlight? If you're moving at quarter lightspeed, and turn on a flashlight which travels *at* lightspeed, wouldn't you measure the beam of light to be traveling at the remaining 75%?\"  No, you actually wouldn't.

    "answer": "There are a lot of comments in here about the cost of the inputs to the product. This is wrong. Outside very specialized and explicit contracts, called \"cost plus\" and almost exclusively used in government/military contracts, the price has nothing to do with the cost.  Products get their final price by the seller guessing what they can charge that will maximize profit (like /u/ViolettPapillon describes). This is entirely based on the buyers' willingness to pay, NOT what the product cost to produce.   The only role cost plays is that if your suspected price is lower than your cost, you don't enter the market at all (because you think you'll lose money). As long as you reasonably believe you can charge more than it costs, you will price it as high as you think the buyer will pay. This is called \"value pricing\" and is FAR more common than cost-plus.",

    "answer": "The universe is not infinite in size.  The universe has a finite volume, there are just no \\*edges\\* to that volume.  If that seems weird, it's probably because you're thinking of the Universe embedded in a familiar 3 dimensional geometry, like a box you hold in your hands.  The \\*edges\\* are where objects in a familiar 3D geometry expand \\*into\\* something - but that's not what's happening in our Universe (as described by General Relativity).  It's hard to imagine, but that familiar 3D geometry is wrong, when describing the Universe.  Instead, think of the universe as the 3-dimensional analogue, to the 2-dimensional surface of a balloon.  If you are an ant on that 2D surface (like we are, in the 3D volume of the universe) then your perception is that the surface area is finite in size, but it \\*has no edges\\* - in exactly the same way our Universe is finite in size, but has no edges.  Let's say someone takes the ant's balloon, and starts blowing it up even more.   The ant will notice that the surface area is increasing - even though it has no edges.  The ant might ask \"But what is it increasing \\*into\\*?\"   And it's not increasing \\*into\\* anything -- it's just that when you blow a balloon up, the radius increases (let's call this radius \"the metric\") and that causes the surface area of the balloon to increase, too.  That's what's happening to our Universe.  There is a metric, it is increasing, and it causes the finite 3D volume of the universe to increase, without edges to this universe.",

While as a lot of people are correct in commenting for weight, there are a lot of other things ports check. Permits; in certain states you have to have a long combination vehicle permit to pull more than two 28's or a single 45 or 53. They also check hours of service, a semi driver can not drive more than 11 consecutive hours in any 24 hour period. They perform what are called roadside inspections for violations of the actual vehicle, brake thickness, wipers, lights, tires, tire chains in the Northern states, steering, etc. Port employees can take a driver put of service for any violations.   For the overweight trailer question. The port can instruct you to offload freight but that usually doesn't happen unless you are grossly overweight. Typically you just get a ticket, but they can make you offload to another vehicle if necessary. Coming from a company and area that can pull overlength sets of trailers, we typically \"drop\". What that means if we're pulling triple 28's or double 45's we have to leave a trailer at the port and another driver has to come retrieve it. Not all companies have the license to do this and the state decides if the roads can handle overlength/overweight trailers.   Source: I train drivers not to do any of things I just listed above.

    "answer": "The fold in the eyelid you are describing is called the epicanthic fold. it's associated with greater levels of fat deposition around the eyeball, a feature that is the most prominent in native North Siberian, Aleutian and Inuit populations. The extra tissue is thought to provide greater insulation for the eye and sinuses from the effects of cold, especially from freezing winds, and to represent an adaptation to cold climates. That means that in extreme temperatures, their faces would be more protected from sub-zero temperatures which could freeze the nose, lips, eyelids and severely irritate and cause cold injuries to the sinuses. It has also been suggested that the fold itself may provide a level of protection from snow blindness. In extreme periods of cold, those who could see best in blinding sunlight reflecting off of snow and ice could hunt most successfully.  its appearance in peoples of Southeast Asia can be linked to possible descent from cold-adapted ancestors, its occurrence in various African peoples doesn't follow a cold-adaptive explanation for it appearing in the latter groups. The epicanthic fold found in the san African people has been tentatively linked to protection for the eye from the high levels of ultraviolet light found in desert and semi-desert areas.

Air can't hold as much heat energy, and it is also more of an insulator, so we hold on to our heat better.  But water will transfer heat much better, so even though 30C water is warmer than 25C air, we are warmer than both of those, and water transfers it better.

    "answer": "Data can be used to optimize processes and predict behaviour. The former can lead to significant cost-cutting while the latter can increase sales. On top of that, data can reveal far more than people are willing to share or are even aware of.  For example, most shops are franchises. And most franchises are owned by umbrella corporations or multinationals. That means those corporations can collect data on their customers across a wide variety of stores.  Let's say I have a customer discount card for a supermarket, a clothing store and a drug store all owned by the same corporation. There are hundreds of thousands or even millions of people like me who all shop at those same stores.  Those cards let stores track my purchases. And if I start buying diapers regularly, it's reasonable to assume I had a baby recently.  So if you compare my current shopping pattern over the last 9 months to my shopping pattern over the last two years, you can see how my behaviour changed during my pregnancy.  I stopped drinking alcohol. I changed my meals. I started taking different vitamins. I started buying different kinds of clothes. There are countless clues to my shopping behaviour really.  If you collect this data on thousands or even millions of women that you know are pregnant. You can start identify indicators that very accurately predict which customers are pregnant even though they haven't told you.  Now you can change the advertising you serve these customers with to be specifically targeted at pregnancy-related products. This is much more relevant to their interests than untargeted advertising and as such, more likely to be successful.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg really. Big data analysis can very accurately predict a staggering variety of qualities like sexuality, age, gender, political and cultural leanings and so on.  It works so well that it can accurately predict behavioural factors the person themselves isn't even aware of. Ie. a person might think and say they're fairly liberal but their behaviour indicates that they're much more conservative than they think and as such more sensitive to conservative-leaning messages.  Simply put, your personal behavioural data is more honest about you than you're willing to be, even to yourself. And when you can collect data like that on millions, you start to understand people at a level that people don't even understand themselves or each other.

    "question": "ELI5: in tv shows how much of the next season they film while filming the previous one, for continuity reason and stuff, or how they make them transition seamlessly?",
    "answer": "Given the large break in between seasons, it is highly unlikely that any filming for a future season will be going while at the same time filming for a current season. For a TV Show, you're almost certainly only ever filming one episode at a time, as you have production schedules to meet and a single episode requires weeks of production around it.  Continuity is maintained simply by paying attention to it and hiring staff to enforce it. The producers and writers will typically come up with what is known as a \"show bible.\" It's like the written wiki for that show, updated and maintained as the show progresses. That covers continuity at a larger level.  Episode-to-episode is usually because you have a somewhat static pool of writers. They develop a collective tone and continuity over the series, which is why many series can change drastically if they writers change.  Lastly, in scene-to-scene you have specific staff members whose job it is to make sure things look the same from shot to shot (since not all shots are done in show order) so that continuity is maintained.",

The reason it feels off is because it's impersonal, not because it's also plural). Some languages have also invented new gender-neutral pronouns and terms, such as \"hen\" in Swedish or xe/xer in English, but these don't always catch on. Some languages already lack pronouns entirely, often using gendered nouns instead like \"that man\", which can be replaced with gender-neutral nouns in a similar way.   Then you've got languages in which all nouns are gendered, often through suffix modification, which are apparently a nightmare for non-binary people. For example, German has no gender neutral word for \"student\", only \"male student\" and \"female student\".",

Currently every nation is the same boat - everybody has economic impact from COVID, increasing oil prices and reduced international travel.  Also the Federal reserve and it's equivalents overseas have still been keeping interest rates tightly controlled which is a direct feeder to general inflation.  So what we are seeing at the moment is that we have prices going up in certain sectors while salaries are not, but inflation is measured as a basket of goods but people's consumption has changed since lockdown - also incomes have been supplemented with government grants. This all paints a very complex picture but basically food prices have gone up, electronics prices have gone up but rents have been frozen (or not gone up as much as they normally would).

We can make devices that count the number of times the crystal has vibrated. So if the crystal is one that vibrates roughly 16,000 times per second, we can connect that counter to a device that counts up to 16,000 then sends a signal. Every signal represents 1 second passing. Now that we have a device that can count seconds (or fractions of a second), we can make a clock! (This is how digital watches work!)  So basically DSLRs and computers have tiny digital watches inside without a screen.   This isn't always super accurate. Cheaper crystals and mechanisms aren't exactly perfect. If I leave my Nintendo Switch disconnected from the internet, it's usually 2-3 minutes off of the \"correct\" time within 24 hours.

Netflix's whole thing is that it makes just enough good content for you to think you should keep your subscription going. It measures the effectiveness of content in terms of watch time - how much time the userbase as a whole spends watching a show. It takes that number and compares it to the cost of making the show, the total time users spend watching *all* content on Netflix, and the subscription fees people pay to figure out an estimate of how much money the show makes for them.

    "answer": "The plankton and algae that die and become deposited on the ocean floor are the source of oil. When many layers of these dead ocean microorganisms pile up in layers, the layers compact on each other due to the weight. This is known as lithifaction. This can make thick layers of concentrated organic matter, especially as it gets buried deep below ground where heat and pressure break down organics into oil. (but not too deep, the earth gets hotter with depth, the oil turns to graphite/carbon if its too deep).  Oil is trapped underground by different types of rocks- Some allow water, oil, and gasses to move through it, like sandstones or shales (along the layers) while other rocks don't allow it to travel through it (perpendicular to the layers in shale), and mudstones. These are called permeable rocks vs impermeable rocks- and they are important in keeping the oil from diluting into other rock layers as something that can't be mined. You have different layers of ocean rock because of seasons and climates. Some seasons and climates favor plankton, others do not. Since over time these change, you have different rock layers.   This doesn't mean that the ocean rock is oil rich, the rock must concentrate the oil some to make it something that can be extracted generally. Oil will have water with it, and water helps dissolve the gasses and volatiles. You have geologic events that create folds in the ground (called anticlines, synclines, domes) that move the oil/gas to concentrated areas where liquid oil can be pumped out of.   &#x200B;  So, in short the plankton is concentrated in the rock, buried deeply with tons of pressure and heat, and then plate tectonics helps concentrate the oil in pockets.  -Geologist in training.",

    "answer": "A musical scale is a series of notes that repeat after an octave. Scales in western music usually have 7 notes, with the eighth being an octave of the first note. An octave is just two notes that sound the same, but one sounds \"higher\" than the other.  In western music, there are 12 notes that repeat: A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, then it starts repeating with A again. [Here's a picture to show how the notes are arranged on part of a piano keyboard](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3c/83/a7/3c83a794158355fe0e58232d9ce56e34.jpg). The # and \u266d note names (the names of the black keys) are interchangeable.  When you play a scale, you aren't playing all the notes. To simplify a lot, some notes just *sound better* when you group them together. If you were to just play all the notes, it might sound like chaos.  For instance, the most common scale in western music is the major scale. You can pick any note and play a major scale starting with that note. If you pick the major scale starting on C, the notes will be C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. If you pick the G major scale, the notes will be G, A, B, C, D, E, F#, G. To figure it out yourself, use this pattern: you can pick a note (call it the *root note* of the scale), then move up the keyboard (to the right) by this set of steps: skip a note, skip a note, don't skip a note, skip a note, skip a note, skip a note, don't skip a note. And that's a major scale.  If you were to \"play in a scale\", you can play any of the notes in that scale in whatever order you want, and they'll \"sound good\" with anyone else playing in that scale.  There are a lot of different kind of scales, and using them in different ways, in combination with each other, helps us to make interesting songs, based on the basic concept of tension and release.",

    "question": "ELI5 How does grounding work with electricity?",
    "answer": "It's important to understand that voltage is relative. It's not an absolute measure of electric charge. It's a measure of electric potential, or the difference in charge between two different points in a circuit. \"Ground\" is identified as a universal reference point for your system. All voltages are measured relative to something, and that something is typically the ground. And the ground has zero electric charge.  In the case of your house it's actually the neutral wire that's carrying current back , which is a bit more complicated to understand. There's some good [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-W42tk-fWc) videos that walk through it.   The question you're asking in residential 120V AC systems however, there's typically no current flowing through the ground wire. The neutral wire carries current back to the source and the ground wire is just a 0V reference point and a safety.",

Resistance exercise hypertrophies (makes the heart bigger) the heart due to increased blood flow during lifting along with usage of the vulsalva maneuver, but does not necessarily lead to improved blood flow dynamics and efficiencies. However, resistance exercise has obvious other benefits though such as leading to bigger muscles (good aestetically and for everyday strength) and combating musculoskeletal deficiencies and diseases.  On the other hand, moderate-high intensity cardio exercise is typically seen to lead to improved blood flow efficiencies along with a stronger heart and indicators of increased performance metrics such as improved VO2max which has shown to lead to a higher quality of life.  Both types of exercise have benefits such as improved glucose (sugar) uptake which helps with diseases such as diabetes, has shown to have mental health and motivational benefits, and combats obesity which is related to other diseases.

    "answer": "Can't answer the question though others have, but I do have a story on this -  Here in the UK we have a website called Right Move, which is basically a property listing website. Most estate agents will list on there from a small terrace house to a multi million \u00a3 mansion. A hobby for a surprising number of people (most will admit to doing the same if you mention you do it too) is to look around at really expensive properties, normally when you've bought a lottery ticket and start imagining what might happen if you win.  You can search huge areas, so I'd always look for somewhere with loads of land. Not that bothered about the house, but I always wanted to put on my own festival. I now do run festivals for a living (and I'm still poor) so realised a lottery win wasn't needed, but I digress.  I once found a place in somewhere like Oxfordshire, enormous amount of land, and oddly cheap. Looking at the photos is became weirder - several houses almost laid out like a street, in the middle of this old farmland. Anyone who's familiar with the UK would instantly recognise them as military style housing, just something about the style that gives them away. The usual smattering of farm buildings too, but they were fenced off. Not like quaint English farm fencing, full on Jurassic Park Category A Supermax prison style electric fencing.  Interest piqued, I read more into it - you were forbidden, by law with ongoing inspections by the Department of Health after purchase and continuing indefinitely, to farm and livestock or crops on the land. Ever.  More reading gave the answer - in the 1990s the UK had an outbreak of BSE or \"Mad Cow Disease\" itself a prion disease. There was footage in the news in the late 90s of cattle infected, filmed on a camcorder, footage from several years earlier that had since been declassified - cows struggling to stand, odd gait, basically \"mad\" and in the full throes of BSE. The footage was filmed at this farm - it was a UK government research centre set up to study the crisis, and was no longer needed. The infected animals were killed, incinerated, and the ashes dumped on the land. But it still isn't safe to use for any food production.  Like I say, the crisis was over by then, hence it being decommissioned, but reading further was 10 times worse than the worst horror film ever.  At one point the UK government thought BSE would turn into CJD in humans. Indeed, for a few hundred to date it has, but it has something like a 20 year incubation period, is totally incurable, and one of the worst diseases known to man. But the original fear was that anyone who'd eaten beef in the previous few decades, as in, fucking _everyone_ (vegetarianism being relatively rare in those days and beef being a stable) would develop CJD at some point in the next decade or two. Nevermind Covid, we're talking 28 Days Later type stuff.  Fortunately, for reasons I don't fully understand, but the comments have explained, it didn't happen.",

From the FAQ for the study I am in:  >**How can this test tell the difference between antibodies produced from infection and antibodies produced from vaccination?**   When a person is infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, their body makes antibodies in response to several viral proteins, including nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein. The vaccines currently approved for use in the UK only trigger antibodies against spike (S) protein.   The lateral flow devices (LFDs) that we used in the self-test antibody study detected antibodies to the spike protein so we were unable to tell if the antibodies were due to infection or to the vaccine (which is why you have been asked to provide this blood sample).

    "answer": "Ever played Pandemic? The way you win Pandemic is to be *highly* infectious but very low lethality. Then, once the entire world is infected, you buy heart failure.   Reality doesn't work like that - the same mutation doesn't arise simultaneously in all instances of the virus - but the important part, that high infectivity, low lethality viruses are S tier, is true. High infectivity and low lethality allows the virus to propagate and multiply. The more people are infected, the more copies of the virus there are. The more copies of the virus there are, the more opportunities the virus has to develop new mutations.   Omicron will already have mutated a bunch of times. Most of those mutations won't change anything. Some of them will make it less effective. Some of them will make it more infective. Some of them will make it more deadly, meaning it's both high infectivity and high lethality. When that happens (and it is a when, not an if), it'll become the next major variant and it could potentially be worse than the first wave. Basically, the fewer people infected, the less likely new mutations are to emerge. A strain that can infect a lot of people is bad because of the future mutation potential.  There's also a matter of simple maths. Imagine that Delta Covid infects 10,000 people per day and hospitalises 1% of infected. That's 100 new admissions to hospitals per day. Now imagine Omicron has half the hospitalisation rate of Delta, but has three times the infectivity. Omicron infects 30,000 people per day, and hospitalises 0.5% of them. That's 150 new admissions per day. That's worse overall even though Omicron is less lethal individually, because it's infecting so many more people.",

    "answer": "Doctor here  It's about expending energy. Your body is using up lots of energy to fight the infection. Any extreme temperatures both hot and cold from the outside will cause your body to expend energy trying to fight against this change in temperature as if tries to reach an equilibrium.  This means being cold or being too hot is wasting your body's energy which it could be using to fight the infection.  It's very much different from the internal thermostat which tells your body to increase its temperature SLIGHTLY to create a fever which kills the infection but hopefully has your enzymes still working well and good. This is also why it's recommended to only take fever lowering medication if your body temperature goes over 38,5C. Over 38,5C starts bring detrimental to normal bodily functions. 37 to 38,5C is usually the sweet spot.  In addition, getting yourself wet usually leads to some cooling through evaporation which again, causes your body to use precious energy reserves to heat you back up again.  Being under a blanket is different in this regard. It's not sudden extreme temperature. Just a way for your body to not feel subjectively cold due to the difference between your body temperature and outside temperature. And if actually saves your body energy resources.  Just as not moving and staying in bed and sleeping works wonders for getting healthy too because it saves energy. Also eating soup or other easily digestible things is a good idea. Why? Because digestion is an energy intensive process when you have to digest meat and veggies and fruit.   Why do people get drowsy when they fall ill?

    "question": "ELI5: How do we still not know what gravity \u201cis\u201d?",
    "answer": "Gravity is much, much weaker than the other forces of nature on a particle-by-particle basis. It's about 10^36 times weaker than electromagnetism, for example, which is why a thin string's chemical bonds can hold an object up against the gravitational pull of the entire Earth. (Another, equivalent, way to put this is that the electric charges of particles are much bigger than their masses in some sense.)  Put another way, gravity is about as much weaker than the electromagnetic force as you are smaller than a large star cluster.  This means that it's very hard to get gravity to create measurable effects in a laboratory, even in the most energetic particle accelerators. In fact, it's so weak that we don't even have a great measurement for how strong gravity is on everyday scales: we only know the value of a few digits of the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant). And that's measured by effects on objects that are human-sized. To understand how gravity works in the context of particle physics, we need to measure its effect on things like protons, which are much, *much* smaller.",

    "answer": "A headache is just that, a headache.  A migraine is a neurological condition that can come with fat more complex symptoms. these will often include a headache as an obvious one, but not always, and will often include other effects too.  Personally I can experience an aura distorting my vision (like looking at everything through the pattern made by the transporters in the original star trek), sickness, and numbness travelling through my arms and face alongside the headache (which is also a different type of headache, like a pressure behind the eyes).  Other people also experience things like a sensitivity to light or noise, and undoubtedly other things I am not aware of.  Some people have obvious triggers like certain foods or stresses, others are more of a mystery.  If I get a migraine, that is me often shut down for a day or more - the auras starting give me only a few minutes to stop doing things like driving before it becomes dangerous, and then I can be left dealing with the headache and vomiting for a significant period and unable to do anything else other than hiding in bed and trying to sleep through as much as possible. So no, not just a headache I can power through, but a complete show stopper for that day, and one that can cause major problems if I am not at home (or able to get a lift there within half an hour or so).",

For physical magnets, like the kind you stick to your fridge, they get their magnetism by essentially being made up of a bunch of tiny magnets. The particles that make up atoms have a natural magnetic field due to a fundamental property they have, called \"spin\". This makes them like tiny magnets.

If you\u2019re in college, find these courses in the syllabus.

And if you\u2019re \u201cbad at math\u201d, change your self-conception and push yourself to get better. Math is about practice more than it is about talent. And math is necessary to really, truly appreciate the beauty of these ways of thinking. So make friends with math.    If you\u2019re not at a university, use Khan academy or any university\u2019s free online courses to study this stuff.

You go build something, you get paid $10M, it costs $9M to build the thing, $1M of money flows through to you, you pay US taxes on $1M.  Now imagine that in addition to your construction business in the US, you have a shell company set up in the Cayman Islands.  Your US business gets the contract to go build the thing for $10M.  But now, in scenario 2, your US business hires your Cayman Islands business to do the work.  Your Cayman Islands business charges your US business $9.95M.  Now only $50k flows through to you in the US, and you pay US taxes on the $50k.  Your Cayman Islands business still had to spend $9M on building the thing you got paid $10M to build, so it has $950K left that it earns now as 'corporate profit'.  In the Cayman Islands, that $950K has 0 tax applied to it.  In this scenario, your money is now \"stuck\" in the Cayman Islands.  However, your Cayman Island company that has $950K can buy various things you might be able to make use of (houses, jets, etc.)  Your usage of those things is technically taxable in the US, but it can become hard to enforce. It can also invest the money to make more money, and no taxes would be owned on it until it was distributed to you. 2. Minimize your state tax bill by 'residing' in a 0 state tax state.  There are 9 of them - Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.  Most very rich people have a home in at least one of these states that they claim - rightly or wrongly - is their primary residence.  The Tri-State area (NY, NJ, CT) and California have tried to clamp down on this, but in the end, if you can avoid spending 180 days in those states, you're home free of state tax. 3. Minimize your federal tax bill with loss carry forwards and depreciation expense.  This was a big one for Trump, but is widely used.  Any assets you own, including commercial real estate, you're allowed to depreciate over a 'useful life'.  That depreciation counts as an expense - even though no cash was spent - against the income you pay the federal government.  You can also offset your income with other 'investment' losses, that can sometimes be creatively finagled.  The IRS frowns on 'creativity' like this, and most of it is borderline illegal or completely illegal (but not all - if you invest all your money in GME for fun, you'll be able to write that off eventually), but, enforcement is low since the IRS has such a low enforcement budget. 4. Never realize your profits from investments.  Similar to #1 where a shell company in the Caymans lets you delay realizing profits, there is a tax loophole called the **1031 exchange** which lets you delay realizing assets from property.  It was partly closed in the 2017 tax bill (for all assets other than real estate), but of course was left open for real estate by our real estate developer president.  With 1031, say you bought a house in 2000 to rent out (and you have your Cayman company to manage it, so they keep the profits from rent).  It makes a bunch of money every year, you invest some of the money back to make the house nicer, it still depreciates some giving you some tax write-off, etc.  Fast forward to 2021.  You paid $1M for the house in 2000.  You put $2M of improvements in over the years from rental income.  The market is now red hot, and the house is now worth $10M.  If you did your accounting right, you now have $7M of capital gain ($9M if you didn't).  BUT, if you sell the house and use the money to buy another house or other piece of real estate for $10M, you owe $0 in taxes.  You can get even more creative, and sell your business as a piece of real estate (in certain circumstances) to use this loophole.  For example, I know of a case where a film studio was sold as a real estate transaction.  There was absolutely real estate involved (they needed somewhere to shoot), but part of the value of the 'real estate' was the business that ran within it (including contracts to shoot in the studio, and the studio's reputation or 'good will').  The studio gets sold for $100M or $200M or whatever it was, but it gets called a 'real estate sale'.  The ex-studio owner then had 45 days to identify $100M+ of property to buy - so he bought dozens of houses in a few very hot rental markets.  He avoids paying taxes on his big sale, and now has rental income (which comes with depreciation write offs, and can be directed elsewhere).  &#x200B;  Why can't everyone do the same?  These structures cost money to set up and some require playing games with real estate, which has high barriers to entry.",

An estate agent should be doing the process frequently enough that they do it efficiently.

So in the same way a professional chef probably will turn out a better meal than you or I would (and is covered by insurance if they do give you food poisoning) a professional estate agent should provide an easier process for you selling your house than you would do on your own.

    "answer": "An engine does not have infinite power or rev ability. It requires more effort to accelerate than to cruise. Lower gears mean that the engine is turning more times (more power) for every time the wheel turns. This gives it the extra oomph to accelerate. But the engine can only rev so high, so more gears are needed to go faster. As you go faster the gear ratio changes meaning the engine is turning less times for every rev of the wheel. This creates efficiency at high cruising speeds for better gas mileage. It only takes about 15 horsepower to keep a car going at speed, while it takes many more ponies to get up to that speed. All that being said, there is a style of transmission known as a continuously variable transmission, which doesn't change gears so much as smoothly changes the ratio as needed while driving, resulting in a smooth acceleration without changing individual gears.",

Based on their depictions it feels like it would take far longer for one of these giants to do that. How come?  They're giant. The distance from their shoulder to the (giant) table is further than the distance from your shoulder to a normal sized table.

It seems to me that this is less secure than an old chipless card that at least requires a PIN.",
    "answer": "The chip and/or the PIN are a means of verifying the transaction is legit.  On a card without the chip, the only data is its number, the expiration date, and maybe the verification code on the back. The magnetic stripe is usually just the card number. These kinds of terminals require the PIN because (hopefully) only the authorized cardholder knows that PIN. These cards are easy to duplicate so we NEED extra security measures.  Cards with a chip, on the other hand, are a lot harder to replicate. The chip is actually a tiny computer that does some math on some inputs and generates numbers in a way that isn't easy to guess even if you see it done for a few thousand inputs. The bank who issues the card knows the secret information that makes it possible to predict the numbers. So, oversimplified, when you use a chip reader, the terminal gives the chip some inputs, gets the chip's result, then sends the inputs and the results to the bank. The bank verifies that the inputs should produce that output on your chip. So in a way, the chip IS the PIN, but it's more secure than that because you can't accidentally give someone knowledge that makes them able to replicate your chip.  It's probably possible to copy a card with a chip, but it would take a high degree of sophistication and someone would have to physically steal your card to do it. You can't reproduce the chip from observing a single read, and in theory even seeing hundreds of thousands of input/output wouldn't be useful. Because it's incredibly close to impossible to duplicate these chips, when a terminal uses the chip as an ID you don't have to use a PIN. The assumption is it means someone would've had to have stolen your actual card and you'd probably notice that much more quickly than it takes to figure out someone's skimmed a traditional card.",

You can see in your link when the purchasing power of the dollar went up in 1930 because that deflation was part of the Great Depression.  Deflation is bad because it kills production.  Suppose prices went down 10%, and people expect that to continue for a few years.

And the restaurants lay some people off, and so do the department stores selling appliances, and so do the appliance factories.

    "answer": "As a reformed project manager (not civil): unlike in some fields like maybe software, or in infrastructure projects where more of the entire project is _entirely_ under you control (say in building an airport or erecting a new chemical refinery), civil projects have SOOO many pieces going on. And quite a few of them are NOT under your control.   If you work for BP and you're building a new refinery, you've done your environmental compliance assessment, you've lined up your contractors years in advance, you own the land and you don't care about the interruption to your other facilities - you've already dealt with it to as to not interrupt. And if your workers have to go the long way around, well, you're just paying them overtime. THe only one affected is you/your corporation.   Civil projects: well you gotta have public consultations, you have to re-route utilities, redirect traffic, do site work and thousands of other things _before you sink a shovel_. AND, all the things to reverse this are scheduled to happen AFTER the bridge is done. If ANYTHING goes wrong with the actual bridge building, everything gets thrown for a loop. Bus line 207 got re-routed but was scheduled to resume over the bridge next week? The re-route requires six additional bussess per shift, that's six extra drivers, six extra busses. They're needed to backfill the south boulevard re-route because of the new sewer on Ocean st. in a week. If the bridge project takes longer now I need six MORE buses and drivers. Oh and you have no direct control over this, this is the transit planner and they don't like you by the way.   So, you can mitigate a lot of these by having contingnecy plans. But those require resources to be reserved and allocated all of which costs money. I can plan you a project that comes in on schedule but if it has to be able to absorb any and all possibilities itll cost you - you probably won't like it.   A good example: my city was laying a railway underpass. Every day the rail line was disrupted cost the city $XXXXXX.  They're pouring concrete in Febuary... in Canada. The weather was forecast to be good for _that particular week_, but below a certain temperature concrete doesn't set right or it cracks or something (I dunno, Im not civil). So to protect the pour they threw up a big heated tent large enough for the machines and shotcrete trucks. Cost like $1.2M. Oh my god did the peons have a field day with _that_. Never mind that had the bridge not been completed on time (and if the concrete doesn't pour correctly you have to do it over. All of it.) the city would have been paying the railway like $100k per day or more. So $1.2M to protect against what could have been much more than that... seems like a deal to me.   So yeah. Civil projects are a balance between cost and what the city can afford, minimizing interactions with other government departments, minimizing disruption to people, business and traffic. There's lots of communication and inter-dependency and if _anything_ goes wrong (heaven forbid your archeology survey didn't catch an indigenous burial ground) everything else falls apart or falls into some very expensive contingency plans.",

    "answer": "If you buy a Treasury bill you are lending money to the US.  As the T-bill matures they owe you an increasing return.  A lot of US debt is owned by banks, investors, and foreign gov'ts, too.  This is why it's a big deal if the US gov't credit rating slips from AAA - future loans would then cost a lot more to service and pay back.  So if the US decided \"eh, we ain't paying anyone back, our debt no longer exists\" your investment would become worthless.  Also people wouldn't be keen to lend the US money anymore.  Also, it isn't just rich, connected people who would suffer.  There are plenty of investment funds managing mom and pop retirement savings that would lose their asses.

    "answer": "edit: below is an explanation of how *e* naturally comes up in math and physics, assuming solid end of high school math level, ignore if you are looking for an actual 5 yo explanation, ty.   It's quite natural to wonder what are the functions where the values (=position, intensity, number of smth) are proportional to the derivative (=speed, slope, growth). Many important phenomenons like bank interest, inflation, virus propagation, cell proliferation, population growth when unchecked, nuclear chain reaction and nuclear decay behave according to that.   So mathematically, that is f'=af. Where a is a constant, the growth rate. Easiest is to take a=1 for starters, so f'=f. You see that if a function f is a solution to this equation, b\\*f is also a solution, for any constant b, so we can just solve for the simplest case f(0)=1 and just find all other solutions for f(0)=b by multiplying the solutions by b. Finally, if we look for a solution with a Taylor series, i.e. of the form f(x)=f(0)+f'(0)\\*x +f''(0)/2!\\*x^2 + ... + f^(n) (0)/n!\\*x^n + ..., it all simplifies because the derivatives f^(n) (0) are all 1, so we get a nice solution for f, useful to compute valued to any precision, namely f(x)=sum_n(x^n /n!). In particular we can compute to any accuracy f(1) and we call this number e. The function f we call it exponential or exp.  We can further see that exp(x+y) = exp(x)\\*exp(y), so we can start from f(1)=e and get f(2)=e^2 and more generally f(n)=f(1+1+...+1)=e^n , using the classical definition of integer powers (multiply n times by). Since we have a way to compute f also for non-integer numbers, with the polynomial development above, we can use this to continuously and naturally extend the definition of powers to all real numbers, so we can just write exp(x)=e^x . And if we come back to the equation above with f'=af and f(0)=b, simple to see f(x)=b\\*e^(ax) are the solutions we were looking for.   With all that we see that the number e has a really central and natural position in math and physics, and that it was unavoidable that it is found by any population developing calculus sooner or later. We also see there are simple ways to compute numerical approximations of it, for ex with the polynomial development above.",

Aka, your heart will be better at circulating blood if it's in good shape, thus allowing more blood to get to \"injured\" places in the body, thus healing them faster.  Also, increased exercise causes decreased fat in the body. Fat clogs arteries making blood flow slower. Your body also has to work harder in general to support the extra weight. So, decrease your fat and you'll increase your performance in all areas.  Here's an example. Let's say your liver is damaged. It needs 100 blood cells per hour to heal. Your heart is only able to deliver 75 per hour because it's weak. On top of that you have fat, restricting blood flow, so that 75 cells goes down to 50. It will now take your liver twice as long to heal than if your heart was strong and you had less fat.",

Tiny screens with super high resolution are very profitable in smartphones because people will pay hundreds of dollars for a small panel.

    "question": "ELI5: what is the exact science of how the electrode precipitator machines work that the alkaline water filter companies use to scare you into buying their $8k water filtration system?",
    "answer": "Here's what happens: Chemically pure water doesn't conduct electricity by itself, deionized and distilled water are very poor conductors as well due to the very low electrolyte (mostly salts) concentration. So when you put a pair of electrodes in a cup containing some pure water or deionized water and try to let an electrical current flow, nothing happens. But then again, every day water is not chemically pure nor deionized (and there's no in-home system capable of obtaining that and there's no point in doing that).  If you were to add let's say table salt into the former system, then it would become an electrolytic cell, and chemical reactions would take place into the electrodes; specifically a reduction in the cathode and an oxidation on the anode. This is the point where the scam gets in action: the electrodes in the cell are made from metals, commonly aluminum and copper, copper gets oxidized because of it's reduction potential, therefore forming copper ions in solution.   There are many other reactions that could occur depending on the salts naturally dissolved in water, and all those reactions cross-react with copper ions (and any other harmless ions that might be in drinking water), forming a very chemically-diverse precipitate with a dark foul-color; giving the false idea that the tap water is filthy and unsafe, when in truth the electrodes are to blame.  On a side note, if both electrodes were made from platinum (a very chemically stable metal) you wouldn't see anything but a bubbling indicating water electrolysis into pure hydrogen and oxygen, no foul colors, no anything, because platinum won't oxidize in that setup.  In conclusion, as you already noted it, it's only a ruse to scare people into buying something.",

    "answer": "There is quite the large misconception about \"lack of oxygen\" and \"temperature\" when it comes to climbing Mt. Everest, in that the real technical problem with it is actually the air pressure.  If you've ever been in an airplane, or a fast elevator, you probably experienced a stark change to how your ears hear stuff while either going up or down (a lot less prominent ***while*** flying, but as it happened to me at least twice, I'm not gonna knock it out either). That's the atmospheric pressure affecting your body, which causes a plethora of changes. Eardrums \"popping\" is one of the least bad while climbing the big mountain, and you go up so slowly that you might not even have that one at all, but...  The human body is meant to survive at around 1 atm (read: \"atmosphere\", which is the average Earth's air pressure at sea level, assuming a temperature of 15\u00b0C/59\u00b0F.) A great example of something that can happen if you lower the pressure outside, is that the force that contains your tissues and cells together is now fighting against less force to contain it, which may cause them to swell, and create a plethora of ***really bad symptoms***, such as headaches, nausea, dizziness, shortness of breath (made worse for it being harder to breathe in the same amount of oxygen), and with longer exposure, can lead to cough, vomiting and confusion.  This is called, colloquially, as \"Mountain Sickness\" or \"Altitude Sickness\", and is one of the first big warnings when you get serious about climbing Mt. Everest, basically is the main misconception about the lack of oxygen up there, and why while it does help in some cases, it's not just a matter of bringing an oxygen tank and calling it a day.  Now, for the temperature issue: Yes, it's cold up there. It definitely is. But the problem with stating that as a factoid is also quite problematic, since technically, the air being less dense means you'll lose less body heat to the ambient air. That's the good news.  The bad news is, however, that you'll lose more of it to the snowy ground, and since your tissues tend to be swollen, you will also face an increased bloodflow, your heat-sensitive blood is now more likely to be exposed to the air, which paradoxically makes ot easier for you to lose heat in the thinner atmosphere... So, I guess my line about losing less heat to the ambient air was a bit misleading.  Also worth noting: Your sweat will be doing a much poorer job at regulating our body temperature, since liquids boil (and thus evaporate) at a lower temperature point when at lower pressure/higher altitude...

This was more common in older music when you had mostly analog instruments and single speaker instruments as this would naturally give stereo separation for the concert audience. The recordings did the same in order to give the listener the illusion of attending one of the concerts. So you can actually hear where the different instruments are coming from.",

This separates company \"currencies\" from banks that are allowed to create money through lending.  b) The amounts are not guaranteed. Buy $10 in XYZ gift cards and if XYZ goes broke, that money is gone. There is very little recourse to recover that money. That \"currency\" is as good as the company is financially sound.   c) The company \"currency\" is not legal tender (and is usually far from universally accepted).

    "answer": "These new laws are intending to deregulate the farmers markets to make it easier for private investors and traders to trade in food products and hopefully increase the productivity of the farmers. However the regulation that was in place was there to protect the farmers and consumers from volatile prices. All countries in the world do regulate food production to some degree. The US and Canada have maybe some of the least regulated markets but it is still regulated fairly much. A vital part of the New Deal plan to get the US out of the depression in the 30s were agricultural regulations. And the US have demonstrated that the markets are unable to handle completely unregulated essential products when they deregulated power production in California during the Enron scandal. So the regulation is important to ensure that farmers will get paid at harvest and that consumers will see food in the stores. The complaint against the Indian government is that the new laws will not be able to do this and even though they will open up the markets to speculators they do not work with the market to ensure a steady supply and demand of food.",

But it's the only part where we have sensory cells in our eyes that react directly to photons (we can kinda feel photons outside of that range on our skin, but what we actually feel is just how our skin gets warmer as it absorbs them).

    "answer": "Forgive me if any of this is off, I took the applicable courses for this like 20 years ago, so probably don't remember everything. But in essence:   Metabolism is the process by which your body converts what you eat and drink into energy. Calories are combined with oxygen to release the energy your body needs to function. You burn calories even while at rest, in order to supply the energy your body needs. The number of calories your body uses to carry out these basic functions is known as your basal metabolic rate. In addition to your basal metabolic rate, two other factors determine how many calories your body burns each day (Food processing (thermogenesis) and Physical activity). A portion of calories not burned through these processes is converted into glycogens (sugar essentially), which are easily accessed and metabolised first. The rest are stored by your body in the form of fat, which is retained to supply energy when there aren't enough other nutrients available.  The weight of calorie dense foods does not translate into the amount of weight gained. That weight is determined by the amount of extra calories stored by your body. To translate this into numbers, each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories. The human body needs to burn about 4100 calories to burn that lbs of fat, which will only happen if there are no other easily accessible calories (like glycogens) available.  So, if you consume something calorie dense that exceeds the number of calories your body needs to function, the rest will be stored as fat. Do this often enough, and you'll gain weight.",

Remember the orbitals are electron clouds, its where you have the best chance of finding the electron, its not a rigid path. If you just need to understand to complete assignments, just remember spin directions must oppose in the same orbital/shell.. one up, one down, and so on.. electrons are negatively charged so they ALWAYS repel eachother.   Also, electrons are so small that they do not follow the laws of physics as you and I follow them. Talking about electrons goes extremely deep, people base entire degrees and careers on electrons and the theories get extremely complex.  If I knew what classes you're taking I feel I could give you a better direction.. but consider this, my answer and your question are about subatomic particles, things going *within* a single atom/Molecule.

How serious your reviewer takes it is entirely up to chance and there usually is no mechanism to ensure seriousness.  No-one goes all the way into replication because it's so costly and we collectively estimate this would grind research to a halt  You can think of peer review as sanity check or a first filter.

    "question": "ELI5 how do water wells work? Why did medieval people know where to build them or why they provided clean drinking water?",
    "answer": "Have you ever sat by a lake or river and dug a little hole in the ground? After a while, water will collect in the bottom, because the water flows through dirt and stone around the river too. When it rains, a lot of water flows down into the ground and that ground that carries water is called an aquifer. Depending on what kind of dirt and rocks are there and how the hills and mountains are sloped, it will collect in certain places.   Very ancient people needed water to live, just like we do today. They usually chose to live near rivers, lakes, and streams. They also dug little holes in the ground nearby, and noticed the water in those holes was nice and filtered by the dirt and sand. If they dug a hole and covered it up, their water would taste good and stay clear of leaves, sticks, and algae. So they dug deeper and deeper holes, and found they could move further from lakes and rivers which would flood from time to time.   Where to dig a well was trickier the further you got from water though. Sometimes they dug big holes for nothing, and that was disappointing, but they learned a lot from it. Parents taught their children what to look for, what kinds of rocks and plants made for good well ground.  EDIT: WHOA!!! Glad so many people were amused by writing in my teacher-voice! A recurring question I\u2019ve seen is \u201cHow can dirt filter water?

My opinion is that one group wants true history being taught. i.e. slaves were not immigrants. Native Americans were here first. And another group wants to teach American exceptionalism and not teach the negative parts of US history.   Many conservatives claim that Critical Race Theory teaches that all white people are racist and that white people should all feel guilty.   I disagree and think that those ideas are more from the books White Fragility and How to be Anti Racist.   Critical Race Theory is a legal / law school topic. I don\u2019t know anyone that\u2019s being taught this in K-12.   Black History,Native American history and US history should be taught honestly and accurately.

    "answer": "Boobs are on anatomically female bodies, moobs are on anatomically male bodies. It's not much more than that.  Boobs form when the body has high levels of oestrogen, a growth hormone usually found in high levels in women and low levels in men. Oestrogen signals to the cells that they should grow into a female body plan, including growing breasts during and after puberty. Boobs are comprised of two tissue types - glandular tissue that's theoretically suitable for milk production (although won't actually produce milk until after pregnancy occurs), and fatty tissue.   Moobs can form as a result of unusually high oestrogen, in which case they will develop both tissue types and be anatomically identical to boobs (this is particularly useful medically, as it allows trans women to grow breasts by simply adding oestrogen to the system), but more commonly they're just a build-up of fat, in which the fatty tissues of the upper chest swell up in a way that looks like boobs, but no glandular tissue forms, which is  why fat moobs have a different shape to boobs. Although, fat does increase oestrogen production in the body, so a sufficiently fat person may end up developing small amounts of glandular tissue as a result of the extra oestrogen.",

Columbus claimed that the sea distance from Spain to China was far, far less than it really would have been had the Americas not been there because he believed the Earth was far smaller than it really is.  People knew the Earth was round and had a pretty good idea just how bit it was, it was estimated pretty accurately in Ancient Greek times, and they knew Columbus' idea of how far it would be to China was ludicrously short, meaning the amount of food and water he could pack into his ships would run out a fraction of the way there, and then everyone would starve.  By dumb luck it turned out the Caribbean islands that Columbus arrived at happened to be about the same distance from Spain as his false calculations indicated China would be.  In the case of John Cabot, the first to make the crossing in the North Atlantic, European fishermen were already at that time sailing out the Grand Banks to go fishing, and there was a degree of anecdotal belief amongst the fishing community that there was land there, as things like weather patterns were consistent with the presence of land, so even though nobody had yet been there, they had a pretty decent idea that there would be land to be found.

Second, this \u201ccoma\u201d or state of sedation isn\u2019t done to treat the overdose itself. It is done again to allow for uncomfortable medical interventions such as a breathing tube and possibly cooling (targeted temperature management).  When he overdosed, his breathing became so slow and shallow and he did not get enough oxygen and he could not blow out carbon dioxide. When the heart doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen it will stop beating. When the brain doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen for long enough, it causes brain damage (anoxic brain injury).   CPR is used to circulate blood as we try to restart the heart with medication and/or shocks.  A breathing tube is placed to breath for the patient until they can breath on their own.  When a patient has cardiac/respiratory arrest, they almost always have some amount of brain damage, unless high quality CPR was started immediately. We keep them on ventilators (breathing machine connected to the breathing tube that goes down his throat) because the brain damage means he likely wont be able to breath on his own for a while. In many cases after cardiac arrest we also \u201ccool\u201d the patient. This means bringing down their body temperature low enough that it slows metabolism by brain cells and can possibly reduce long term brain damage.  In the next couple days, they will try turning down the sedation to see if he wakes up and evaluate how his brain is functioning (called a sedation vacation). If he does wake up, they will also try a spontaneous breathing trial- turning the ventilator off briefly to see if he is able to breath on his own.

So you take your YFG-HA gene, put it into a vector for expression, and put that vector into cells.  Your gene gets transcribed and translated by the cells that have your vector, and they make a whole bunch of YFG-HA protein.  Now, how to purify it?  First, you burst all your cells with soap and shred them apart into a uniform protein soup.  Then, you take an antibody against the HA tag which binds it tightly, and you stick a coating of that antibody to tiny sand-sized plastic beads. You put those beads into a column, and run your protein soup through it. Your YFG-HA protein sticks to the antibodies on the beads while everything else runs through.  You put a few rinses of fluid through the plastic sand to really clean up those YFG-HA proteins trapped in there, then you run a different liquid through that breaks the antibody's bond to the HA tag, and you flush out a clean and pure solution of YFG-HA protein.",

CPR is used to circulate blood as we try to restart the heart with medication and/or shocks.  A breathing tube is placed to breath for the patient until they can breath on their own.  When a patient has cardiac/respiratory arrest, they almost always have some amount of brain damage, unless high quality CPR was started immediately. We keep them on ventilators (breathing machine connected to the breathing tube that goes down his throat) because the brain damage means he likely wont be able to breath on his own for a while. In many cases after cardiac arrest we also \u201ccool\u201d the patient. This means bringing down their body temperature low enough that it slows metabolism by brain cells and can possibly reduce long term brain damage.  In the next couple days, they will try turning down the sedation to see if he wakes up and evaluate how his brain is functioning (called a sedation vacation). If he does wake up, they will also try a spontaneous breathing trial- turning the ventilator off briefly to see if he is able to breath on his own. If he passes both of those they may be able to take the breathing tube out, and if not they will keep it and try again the next day.",

    "answer": ">Does that involve routers like the ones we have at home?  Conceptually, yes. They're much bigger routers, with many more wires coming out of them, but fundamentally they do the same thing: move data across and between networks.  Every bit of data you send and receive travels through a number of routers on its way to you. Basically, the flow looks something like this:  * Your computer hands your router a data packet. * Your router reads the packet and determines the address it's going to.  * If your router knows which of its ports \"has\" the address, it sends the packet down that wire.  * If it doesn't, it forwards the packet up to the next router above it.  While simplified, this is how data travels across the internet: each router knows what IP addresses it can reach, and if it can't see where the packet is supposed to go, it sends it to a router above it, and the process repeats until it gets where it's going or fails.",

It's not that there's less water overall, it's just that changing weather patterns changes where the water is going, which is places were it's either not needed or inaccessible.   For example, less winter snow in the Rocky Mountains means less spring and summer water in the Colorado River watershed which provides water for much of The Southwestern U.S., eventually emptying in the Pacific. At the same time, Typhoons in the pacific are getting bigger and more frequent, so there's more water being dumped back into the ocean. In other words, water that used to fall as snow in the Rockies is now falling as rain in the Pacific Ocean where it's unusable. That's a simplistic explanation but you get the drift.",

For example, I'm a programmer who works in the insurance industry. I've worked in it for over 15 years and I understand a lot about how insurance and insurance systems work, but every different insurance company I work for has a different way of running their business.  So, the business know how their business runs, but don't know how to build/program systems, and I know how to build/program systems, but don't fully understand the business.  This is where a Business Analyst (BA) comes in. It's their job to understand how the business works, and help extract the requirements that the business needs for their IT system. The BA then helps 'translate' those requirements into a form (usually called use cases or user stories) that programmers can understand in order to implement. BA's can also help testers define their test cases around the same use cases/user stories so that the features can be properly tested to ensure they meet the business' requirements.  That's only part of a BA's role, they can also do work to analyse and improve business processes, help with documentation and various other tasks, but this is the main interaction with IT/programmers that I think you're looking for.

    "answer": "A recurrence relation is fundamentally a mathematical concept, so you're not going to fully understand it until you put some time in to think about the math. But here's an example of applying one.   Suppose you're cutting a piece of paper. Each time you cut the paper, you take all the pieces and stack them on top of each other, then cut right down the middle.   Now we want a function for the number of pieces of paper produced by c cuts. Intuitively, we know we'll go from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16... pieces of paper. We can therefore jump right to an analytic function: f(c) =2\\^(c-1). However, we can also write the recurrence relation. Each time we cut we double the number of pieces of paper we had before: r(c) = 2\\*r(c-1) for c>0. We also need to specify that we started with 1 piece of paper: r(0)=1.   Both ways of expressing the number of pieces of paper are valid and useful. For my money, the recurrence relation better expresses our intuition. Each cut produces twice as many pieces as the number we had before that cut. A computer is also very good at calculating the recurrence relation because it just means writing a simple function and calling it a bunch of times. This is not to say that a computer should have any trouble with 2\\^(c-1), but there are plenty of recursive expressions that don't have an analytical equivalent (like the Fibonacci sequence), yet they're still easy for computers. This is one reason why recurrence relations are such a big part of algorithms.",

When an electron and a proton are near each other their interaction is attractive rather than repulsive as they have opposite charges.

(Another, equivalent, way to put this is that the electric charges of particles are much bigger than their masses in some sense.)  Put another way, gravity is about as much weaker than the electromagnetic force as you are smaller than a large star cluster.  This means that it's very hard to get gravity to create measurable effects in a laboratory, even in the most energetic particle accelerators. In fact, it's so weak that we don't even have a great measurement for how strong gravity is on everyday scales: we only know the value of a few digits of the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant).

    "answer": "Forgive me if any of this is off, I took the applicable courses for this like 20 years ago, so probably don't remember everything. But in essence:   Metabolism is the process by which your body converts what you eat and drink into energy. Calories are combined with oxygen to release the energy your body needs to function. You burn calories even while at rest, in order to supply the energy your body needs. The number of calories your body uses to carry out these basic functions is known as your basal metabolic rate. In addition to your basal metabolic rate, two other factors determine how many calories your body burns each day (Food processing (thermogenesis) and Physical activity). A portion of calories not burned through these processes is converted into glycogens (sugar essentially), which are easily accessed and metabolised first. The rest are stored by your body in the form of fat, which is retained to supply energy when there aren't enough other nutrients available.  The weight of calorie dense foods does not translate into the amount of weight gained. That weight is determined by the amount of extra calories stored by your body. To translate this into numbers, each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories. The human body needs to burn about 4100 calories to burn that lbs of fat, which will only happen if there are no other easily accessible calories (like glycogens) available.  So, if you consume something calorie dense that exceeds the number of calories your body needs to function, the rest will be stored as fat. Do this often enough, and you'll gain weight.",

For example, the speed of the wave on a coffee cup in a car's cup holder is the speed of the wave in the coffe, plus the speed of the coffee itself (which is moving at the speed of the car)   However, when it comes to electromagnetism, it appeared that there was no equation that told us the speed of the thing that light was travelling in. In Maxwell's equations, the vacuum speed of light just always equal to c.  This means that regardless of the source, whether it a lamp, or a moving car, or the Sun, or a spaceship flying towards me, I will always measure the speed of light from any of these sources to be c.  Turning that around, it also means that if I ever try to accelerate myself even faster, I will still _always_ measure the speed of my headlights to be c, which is why you can never accelerate faster than the speed of light.

It's quite natural to wonder what are the functions where the values (=position, intensity, number of smth) are proportional to the derivative (=speed, slope, growth). Many important phenomenons like bank interest, inflation, virus propagation, cell proliferation, population growth when unchecked, nuclear chain reaction and nuclear decay behave according to that.   So mathematically, that is f'=af. Where a is a constant, the growth rate. Easiest is to take a=1 for starters, so f'=f. You see that if a function f is a solution to this equation, b\\*f is also a solution, for any constant b, so we can just solve for the simplest case f(0)=1 and just find all other solutions for f(0)=b by multiplying the solutions by b. Finally, if we look for a solution with a Taylor series, i.e. of the form f(x)=f(0)+f'(0)\\*x +f''(0)/2!\\*x^2 + ... + f^(n) (0)/n!\\*x^n + ..., it all simplifies because the derivatives f^(n) (0) are all 1, so we get a nice solution for f, useful to compute valued to any precision, namely f(x)=sum_n(x^n /n!). In particular we can compute to any accuracy f(1) and we call this number e. The function f we call it exponential or exp.  We can further see that exp(x+y) = exp(x)\\*exp(y), so we can start from f(1)=e and get f(2)=e^2 and more generally f(n)=f(1+1+...+1)=e^n , using the classical definition of integer powers (multiply n times by). Since we have a way to compute f also for non-integer numbers, with the polynomial development above, we can use this to continuously and naturally extend the definition of powers to all real numbers, so we can just write exp(x)=e^x . And if we come back to the equation above with f'=af and f(0)=b, simple to see f(x)=b\\*e^(ax) are the solutions we were looking for.   With all that we see that the number e has a really central and natural position in math and physics, and that it was unavoidable that it is found by any population developing calculus sooner or later. We also see there are simple ways to compute numerical approximations of it, for ex with the polynomial development above.",

    "answer": "There are different types, but one uses sodium acetate dissolved in water. It's a super-saturated solution, meaning that really there is more stuff dissolved in the water than the water would \"like\". So the sodium acetates \"wants\" to start come out of solution and form solid crystals. To start growing a crystal, though, you need a *nucleation site*, some little bit of something that the first sodium acetate molecules can latch onto and then gather into a crystal from there. Without a nucleation site, the sodium acetate stays in its super-saturated solution.  The hand warmer packet contains this solution along with a little strip of metal. If you bend this strip, little bits of metal come off and these provide nucleation sites for the crystals to start growing. This crystallization process is an *exothermic*, i.e. heat-releasing, reaction.  How did the heat get there? Well, to create a super-saturated solution, you need to dissolve the sodium acetate in hot water (which can hold more stuff in solution) and then let it cool. Some of the heat you put in gets stored in the solution - the heat that was necessary to get it super-saturated (in other words, the solution reaction was *endothermic*). When the excess sodium acetate crystallizes, the heat energy stored in the solution is released.  As to why it is safe, you can calculate how much heat energy will be released and thus how  hot the hand warmer will get. So you can ensure that the temperature will be in a safe range. There's no danger of a \"runaway\" reaction since you know exactly how much sodium acetate you dissolved and how much solution you put in the packet.",

Does it mean your home will be undervalued by realtors when you try to sell it, or any of the myriad other forms of discrimination that black people face?  If not, then what does it mean to \"identify as black\"?  Gender is just about you. Whether you're male or female or something else is about you and nothing else, really. Your family doesn't control your gender, and neither does the government or school or your workplace.  Being black isn't really about the individual. It's about the systems. It's about the family you grew up in, the opportunities you are (or aren't) given, the way you're treated by the authorities and so on. You're black because white people decided that \"black\" is a thing, and decided on how black people should be treated by society.  Black people are not given the _option_ of choosing for themselves, of being treated the way white people are. They can't say \"please don't shoot me officer, I'm white actually\".  So should white people have the option to shop around and go cosplaying as black people (but only ever have to experience the fun parts, while preserving all the privileges you get with being white?)  Being \"transracial\" is really about white people saying \"those black people who used to be our slaves? We still own them. I can still take anything from them that I want.

In a diesel engine, though, even if you let off the gas pedal, the engine will still draw a full charge of air into the cylinders, and that air acts as a spring; because the engine is still turning, it's still compressing the air, and the air then rebounds when the piston falls back down.

Some materials are better at giving off infrared than others and so usually you\u2019ll just make a big surface covered in one of those materials.

Last time I connected to a New York server the latency was about **100ms**.    The distance from Central Europe to New York is about 6000km. There is no straight line connection from me to there so let's add a 50% margin for extra cable length - 9000km of routing equipment, copper and fiber optics.   Latency is given for the signal to travel there and back, so a total travel distance of 18000km.   c is 300000km/s so light in a vacuum would travel the 18000km in about **60ms**.   The signal doesn't travel at that speed through fiber and copper though, only at a high-double-digit fraction of c.       Add to that the possible overhead from quality of service operations and routing equipment compute times and about a 100ms ping would seem like *exactly* what you'd expect - not at all an astronomical discrepancy.",

Energy is conserved, meaning it is overall constant in the universe as it is transferred around and in different forms. All energy in the universe is finite and tends toward universal equilibrium, but in the process it \u201cbounces around\u201d interacting with mass to heat it up, move it, or encourage a chemical reaction. In biochemical energy we refer to a chemical called adenosine triphosphate. Just like the name implies, there are three phosphate groups chained together in this compound. This is not an ideal thing because everything wants to be at the lowest energy level it can be relative to the environment. For ATP this means it really wants to jettison off one phosphate group and become ADP. It needs a little help doing this, and will give off a decent amount of energy  in doing so. When a chemical reaction uses ATP as fuel, the energy released by helping it lower to a more stable compound is used to do *work*. In this case, the work could be something like moving atoms in a compund, breaking bonds, or providing the **umph**  to get certain things to bond.",

    "answer": "The US government partly funds itself by issuing bonds (basically a specialized type of loan). Like any loan, they pay interest. For US government bonds issued by the US Treasury, we call this the \"treasury yield\". It's effectively the interest rate you get from loaning money to the US government. These are considered about the safest possible investment so any more risky loan (which is basically all of them) is going to have a higher interest than the treasury yield. If the treasury yield goes up (the government is paying higher interest), that pushes up the interest rate of \\*all\\* loans. It's a signal that investors are concerned that some combination of 1) the stock market might be dropping, so they're putting their money somewhere safer (bonds) and/or 2) investors are worried about inflation and want a higher yield to make up the value they're going to lose to inflation.  Right now it's some of both, hence the investors freaking out. If inflation gets high, investments have to perform better just to stay ahead of inflation, so their value goes down. And if interest rates get high, it gets more expensive to borrow money, which tends to slow the economy down and make everything more expensive.",

Then a layer of clear-coat is sprayed over all of it, and like varnish on a portrait the clear coat changes the look entirely.  So think of all the variables a touch-up artist gets to juggle.  Say it's a key scratch that goes down to the metal.  You have to match the paint color, which if you're lucky is still factory and comes in a little tube but if not you do it by hand.  Then you have to mix or shake it to get the flakes suspended.  Then you have to apply it with the world's tiniest brush--the applicator in the paint tube is useless for a finesse job.  Then you have to try to sand it flat.    Then you have to try to get a clear-coat over it, and make *that* flat.  All without damaging the area around the scratch, or at least damaging it in such a way that it blends in.

Around 1,000ppm is where harms to health begin, and exposure to 30,000 and above is generally only allowed for short intervals.  In EL5: Carbon dioxide builds up in blood as a byproduct of your body and cells working.  This \"waste\" from your cells actually turns your blood acidic and the gas needs to be removed before it begins to damage fragile organs, which is done in your lungs every time your breathe. Your lungs *really* like to exchange CO2 between your blood and the air, which is usually a good thing when you have a lot of carbon dioxide in your blood and little in the air. However, as the air you inhale becomes more saturated with CO2, your lungs will actually work \"backwards\" to move carbon dioxide from the *air into your blood.* This likely comes down to the fact that human lungs have evolved to expect atmospheric CO2 at <500ppm concentrations, so its never been an evolutionary advantage to figure out how to do that.   Plants, by contrast, use atmospheric carbon as a sort of \"fuel\" during photosynthesis - not producing it as waste - so have no such issue with a buildup of concentration.",

    "answer": "So I can actually give you the best ELI5 answer, so buckle up. (Pun maybe intended.)  Let's go back and imagine you're at the playground as a kid. You're being pushed around the merry go ground by your dad. Every time he pushes, he forces the merry go round to spin. If he wants to spin you faster, he can push harder and harder. Once he's already pushing as hard as he can, he can still make you spin faster by pushing you with the same strength more often.  The force daddy puts on the merry go round to spin it is torque. The power he generated to spin you around is simply the force he pushed with and how often he did it. If he always pushed with the same force, but one time he pushed twice as often as the other, he'd also be making twice the horsepower for the same torque.  The point of an engine in a car is to spin, just like a merry go round. The pistons firing are like the dads and they push the crankshaft around. What happens is that gas goes into the cylinder and explodes which pushes the piston down and the makes the merry go round. The explosion of the gas pushing the piston down is the torque. The more explosions per second, the more total power being made, even if each explosion has the same amount of force. Car engines in fact get a bit more complicated than that since they don't always make the same torque per explosion, but the formula is the same. Literally, torque is measured in foot-pounds, and horsepower is measured in foot-pounds per second, so it's sort of like the difference between saying 50 miles vs. 50 miles per hour. Two cars travel 50 miles, but the one which did it on less time used more power.",

That was incorrect, but it touches on the correct idea that different cultures find different things attractive. For example, some but not all cultures find pale skin a sign of beauty, which isn't grounded in biology.

For one such example, there is a field that describes the distance in inches everywhere in the universe from a cup of coffee. This field varies as cups of coffee are created, consumed, or moved around. While this may seem contrived, it still meets the criteria to be a \"scalar\" field - a field with a single number at each. One such real field like this is the Higgs Field - related to describing the distribution of mass in the universe.   Fields can also have multiple values at every point, for example in 3d space this could be a direction. The gravitational field is one of these, every point in the universe has some direction that gravity would pull on a small mass at that point. Fields are useful tools because often they can exert forces on the things that interact with them - just how a one mass is pulled towards another because their interactions with the gravitational field.   The magnetic field is just another vector field where the value at each point encodes the direction and strength of the push on an object that interacts with the magnetic field - such as moving charged particles, electric currents, or magnetic objects. When we say that an object has \"a magnetic field\", we mean that this object influences the values at all the points in the magnetic field near the object where a stronger magnet changes the values more.  The magnetic field is especially interesting because its relationship with the electric field, as changes in the magnetic field cause changes in the electric field (the direction/strength of forces on static charged particles) and vice versa, a principle that makes generating electricity possible.",

Same thing for your scalp. On almost every adult is a yeast-like organism that munches on the oils of your hair.

This was more common in older music when you had mostly analog instruments and single speaker instruments as this would naturally give stereo separation for the concert audience.

It forms a wave - it moves back and forth between around -230 to +230 volts (for a single phase, but that requires a bit more complex explanation). The current doesn't flow in a straight line either. It essentially flows back and forth continously. The frequency tells you how often this cycle happens in a second. If you connect multiple power stations that don't have the same frequency (or even the same position in the AC wave), it would cause a massive current to flow from one power station to the other, since one power station would be at a different voltage at the same point in time, and current flows from high voltage point to low voltage point.

    "answer": "So I can actually give you the best ELI5 answer, so buckle up. (Pun maybe intended.)  Let's go back and imagine you're at the playground as a kid. You're being pushed around the merry go ground by your dad. Every time he pushes, he forces the merry go round to spin. If he wants to spin you faster, he can push harder and harder. Once he's already pushing as hard as he can, he can still make you spin faster by pushing you with the same strength more often.  The force daddy puts on the merry go round to spin it is torque. The power he generated to spin you around is simply the force he pushed with and how often he did it. If he always pushed with the same force, but one time he pushed twice as often as the other, he'd also be making twice the horsepower for the same torque.  The point of an engine in a car is to spin, just like a merry go round. The pistons firing are like the dads and they push the crankshaft around. What happens is that gas goes into the cylinder and explodes which pushes the piston down and the makes the merry go round. The explosion of the gas pushing the piston down is the torque. The more explosions per second, the more total power being made, even if each explosion has the same amount of force. Car engines in fact get a bit more complicated than that since they don't always make the same torque per explosion, but the formula is the same. Literally, torque is measured in foot-pounds, and horsepower is measured in foot-pounds per second, so it's sort of like the difference between saying 50 miles vs. 50 miles per hour.

    "answer": "The other answers talking about your pupils are incorrect, or at least not fully correct. It's true that the pupil changes size to let different amounts of light it, but that just takes a few seconds.   The process of eyes adjusting to the dark has to do with a chemical in the cells of your retina. Your retina (the part of your eye that senses light and sends the signals to your brain) is made up of two types of cells, rods and cones. Cones see in color but don't work if there's not enough light. Rods only see light and dark, but they can sense very small amounts of light.   In the rod cells there's a chemical called rhodopsin that's responsible for absorbing light and turning that into a signal to send to your brain, When a molecule of rhodopsin absorbs light, it breaks apart. When it's very bright out, all of the rhodopsin molecules are being broken apart by all the light. If you suddenly move into the dark, you don't have any rhodopsin left, so the rod cells can't absorb the light. It takes about 30 minutes for the rhodopsin molecules to \"regenerate\" so that the rod cells can absorb fully light again.",

During the many persecutions (the Holocaust was just one of many) people would be identified by having olive skin, dark features, large noses etc...these are markers of race   In the instance for Ms. Goldberg, in her apologies is seems to be indicated that she felt racism could only be against black people, because of her experience as a black woman.

For example, if you\u2019re on call and someone comes in with chest pain, you should be able to, almost literally, triage that \u201cin your sleep.\u201d   In larger hospital systems (where the majority of physicians train), there are supposed to be redundancies which minimize the fallout from mistakes made by overtired staff. Idk if it\u2019s still the norm, but during my training, residents were usually more worried about being told off by an attending physician than they were about making a rudimentary mistake that could affect patient safety. It wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t care, they just trusted the systems in place to protect from that sort of slip-up.   However, putting my lawyer hat on, some residents and their associated training programs have been held accountable for mistakes that could be attributed to lack of sleep (I\u2019ve got these saved somewhere and would be happy to provide cases upon request).

We form more specific details of what we find attractive by what culture tells us is attractive. Of course Freud is famous for his idea that everyone wants to fuck their own mothers. That was incorrect, but it touches on the correct idea that different cultures find different things attractive. For example, some but not all cultures find pale skin a sign of beauty, which isn't grounded in biology. A particular difference is noted in the difference between male beauty standards across the world. Europe and America tends to like big strong somewhat rugged men, but East Asia tends to prefer their men be boyish and pretty in a way we in the west might normally associate with women - cute, almost.

    "question": "Eli5: Why is data so valuable to companies?",
    "answer": "Data can be used to optimize processes and predict behaviour. The former can lead to significant cost-cutting while the latter can increase sales. On top of that, data can reveal far more than people are willing to share or are even aware of.  For example, most shops are franchises. And most franchises are owned by umbrella corporations or multinationals. That means those corporations can collect data on their customers across a wide variety of stores.  Let's say I have a customer discount card for a supermarket, a clothing store and a drug store all owned by the same corporation. There are hundreds of thousands or even millions of people like me who all shop at those same stores.  Those cards let stores track my purchases. And if I start buying diapers regularly, it's reasonable to assume I had a baby recently.  So if you compare my current shopping pattern over the last 9 months to my shopping pattern over the last two years, you can see how my behaviour changed during my pregnancy.  I stopped drinking alcohol. I changed my meals. I started taking different vitamins. I started buying different kinds of clothes. There are countless clues to my shopping behaviour really.  If you collect this data on thousands or even millions of women that you know are pregnant. You can start identify indicators that very accurately predict which customers are pregnant even though they haven't told you.  Now you can change the advertising you serve these customers with to be specifically targeted at pregnancy-related products. This is much more relevant to their interests than untargeted advertising and as such, more likely to be successful.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg really. Big data analysis can very accurately predict a staggering variety of qualities like sexuality, age, gender, political and cultural leanings and so on.  It works so well that it can accurately predict behavioural factors the person themselves isn't even aware of. Ie. a person might think and say they're fairly liberal but their behaviour indicates that they're much more conservative than they think and as such more sensitive to conservative-leaning messages.  Simply put, your personal behavioural data is more honest about you than you're willing to be, even to yourself. And when you can collect data like that on millions, you start to understand people at a level that people don't even understand themselves or each other.

The standard practice in America and many other countries is to build enough record to cover all of them, and then go to trial with the most important ones (you usually don't see \"murder and jaywalking\" go to trial, because the jaywalking isn't important enough).  The jury's job is to convict on ALL the crimes that are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and not worry about the duplications.  Then, the judge's job is to use that stack to calculate the sentence.  Sentencing laws are complicated, but generally, this is where the principle that your can't be convicted twice for the same crime kicks in. The sentence will mainly come down to the greatest of the offenses, and all the lesser crimes that came along for the ride, but weren't really independent actions, will be considered aggravating factors rather than separate crimes.   P.S. I should add that one reason this is useful is that it's quite common for a jury to find that the most severe felony charge was not proven, but that the lesser charges were proven. For instance if the jury find the accused did indeed kill the victim, but the jury decides it was unintentional, then they don't get convicted of intentional homicide, but that lesser stack of guilty convictions for things like manslaughter and assault will kick in.",

Example: you bet 100$ at 3:1, you will pay 100$ if you lose, but get 300$ if you win. As time goes by, it seems doubtful to you that you will win. You can offer to sell the bet for -50$, meaning you give 50$ in addition to the bet. For you, you end up eating only a 50$ loss instead of 100$, so that's a better position. For the person buying the bet, they essentially end up with a 50$ at 7:1 bet. Since they will pay 100$ if they lose, minutes the 50$ you gave them (50$ total), and they will get 300$ if they win, plus the 50$ you gave them (350$ total).  The bet itself (and it's associated risk and reward) is the asset traded here.",

    "answer": "When people talk of how the establishment didn't believe in Columbus, which has incorrectly transformed in the popular conscious as that they though the world was flat and he said it was round, it was actually for this reason.  Columbus claimed that the sea distance from Spain to China was far, far less than it really would have been had the Americas not been there because he believed the Earth was far smaller than it really is.  People knew the Earth was round and had a pretty good idea just how bit it was, it was estimated pretty accurately in Ancient Greek times, and they knew Columbus' idea of how far it would be to China was ludicrously short, meaning the amount of food and water he could pack into his ships would run out a fraction of the way there, and then everyone would starve.  By dumb luck it turned out the Caribbean islands that Columbus arrived at happened to be about the same distance from Spain as his false calculations indicated China would be.  In the case of John Cabot, the first to make the crossing in the North Atlantic, European fishermen were already at that time sailing out the Grand Banks to go fishing, and there was a degree of anecdotal belief amongst the fishing community that there was land there, as things like weather patterns were consistent with the presence of land, so even though nobody had yet been there, they had a pretty decent idea that there would be land to be found.

    "answer": "There isn't a lack of space for people to live, there is a lack of space WHERE people want to live.  Specifically large cities create high paying jobs.  High paying jobs increase the value of real estate.  Zoning regulations artificially create a max level of density for the city, which pushes demand out to the suburbs.  This causes the same problem there and continues out until commute times to the good jobs becomes untenable.    This is one of the reasons that a big push for permanent WFH for jobs that are possible that way (and many high paying jobs are) could lead to people being able to live anywhere they want without worrying about physical proximity to their work.

    "question": "eli5: Why do commonly used items, such as CRT's or old consoles skyrocket in value after they stop production? Assuming that these items stopped production today, why do sealed boxes or hell even good condition second-hand items almost double in price mere weeks after the end of production?",
    "answer": "CRTs have some advantages over LCDs and other flat-panel display technologies that matter for certain niche applications. To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That's more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don't care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it's turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.  Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you're dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0). So e.g. if you really want to buy a NES today, your options are very limited as you're dependent on the ever-decreasing number of NES's in the world that still work, *and* that people are willing to sell. So even though very few people are looking to buy NES's, the supply is even smaller.  I'm not sure it's accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I'm happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up. Also, often consoles that go out of production are superseded by newer models and the bulk of the demand will switch to them, while the collectors' market will take years to get off the ground. The only exception I can think of would be if the manufacturer (for some atypical reason) stopped producing the console before they had exhausted the (profitable) demand for it (and didn't release a new console yet).",

    "answer": "A few different things can happen to make you constipated, and usually you have all of these things happening together in varying degrees:  Your gut motility (how much the walls are moving stuff through) slows down  You absorb too much water from your intestines into your blood  Your faeces become compacted and hard  Anything you eat that causes any of this to happen is what causes constipation.   Basically, it\u2019s anything low in fibre, high in sugar, and lacking fermentation.  Fibre increases faecal bulking, which stops your stool from becoming compact and hard.   It also draws water into your colon through *osmotic pressure* and encourages gut motility.  Fibre also feeds the natural microflora in your gut, which promotes gut health and further prevents constipation.   If your food is low in fibre, you have none of these benefits, and you are at risk of constipation.  If you eat a diet that has very little fermented food (cheese, yoghurt, kombucha, beer) then you also may become constipated.   These foods contain bacteria that help your intestines function.   They promote gut motility by irritating your gut lining.   They also help digest some of the food you eat and spit out things you need but can\u2019t make by yourself - things like vitamins.

    "answer": "The top 1% of taxpayers in the US account for 20% of the country's income and 40% of the country's taxes.  That ratio is consistent with what you would expect given the tax rates in the country.  Typically people who say that someone isn't paying taxes don't understand how taxes work.  Specifically, neither people nor corporations are taxed on revenue - everyone is only taxed on *income*, which is the amount of money you have left over to spend on yourself.  For low wealth individuals nearly 100% of the money you make is income because the only cost involved in you making money is your time.  But for high wealth individuals and corporations that isn't true.  If you have to pay someone else $100 so that they can earn you $150 then it doesn't make any sense to take you on that $150 in revenue, it only makes sense to tax you on the $50 in income that you actually made.    If you do tax on revenue then all you do is create a situation where people can't afford to both pay taxes and hire employees.  Imagine if you have to pay someone $100 to make $101.  If you get taxed on that $101 of revenue then you end up losing money on that, so no one would do it and its rare for anyone to have a profit margin higher than a few percent.  What this means is that just because someone or something has huge revenue doesn't mean that they have much income.  That is, just because Company X is making $50 billion per year doesn't mean that it has $50 billion per year to distribute to shareholders.  In reality it has far less than that, and its that disposable income that the company gets taxed on.

    "answer": ">eli5 If the speed of electricity is 1/C per second (Thanks Veritasium), how come typical internet latency is astronomically bigger in the milliseconds range?      Last time I connected to a New York server the latency was about **100ms**.    The distance from Central Europe to New York is about 6000km. There is no straight line connection from me to there so let's add a 50% margin for extra cable length - 9000km of routing equipment, copper and fiber optics.   Latency is given for the signal to travel there and back, so a total travel distance of 18000km.   c is 300000km/s so light in a vacuum would travel the 18000km in about **60ms**.   The signal doesn't travel at that speed through fiber and copper though, only at a high-double-digit fraction of c.       Add to that the possible overhead from quality of service operations and routing equipment compute times and about a 100ms ping would seem like *exactly* what you'd expect - not at all an astronomical discrepancy.",

(Wich basically flips each bit of the original if the corresponding bit of the random number is 1)  So to undo that you need the encrypted data and the same random number. Just apply XOR again to flip the correct bits back.  XOR(A, B) = C -> XOR(C, B) = A  This number isn't truly random. It's generated by an algorithm from a password (or Key).

    "question": "ELI5: What is Internet of Things mean (IoT) and how it works?",
    "answer": "Put really simply, \"Internet of Things\" is the idea that a lot of devices we use could be exposed to and controlled by a network and that this could be a good thing.  For example, having a lamp connected to the internet sounds silly to begin with, but it lets you create a remote control for the lamp. It's not that remote controls for lamps don't already exist, but they tend to use radio signals or infrared and both of these have line of sight and range problems. Having web-enabled doodads in the house means you can check if you left the oven on from the store and, if so, turn it off. Or, if you see a great deal on a roast while shopping but it's kind of late, you can start the oven preheating before you leave. Or, if you plan to arrive home after dark, you don't have to *leave* lights on, you can turn them on when you approach from outside.   The \"how it works\" is a bit of a mess right now. A lot of devices use their own special \"language\". For example, my fridge has internet-related features, but I can only control it from a specific app the manufacturer makes. My thermostat is internet-enabled, but interfaces with Amazon Alexa so I have more choices about how to control it. But there are some other \"languages\" that are more open, and devices that use those can be controlled from a lot of different apps or other devices.  There are lots of rainbow-tinted unicorn fantasies about how great it would be if every device were internet enabled. But whether it's a good thing or not really comes down to who implements it, how they implement it, and what they do with it.  For example, it'd be GREAT if my fridge could tell me its inside temperature regularly and how long it's running. Then I could use programs to perform analysis and notice if it seems to be malfunctioning. Instead, the only thing I can really do with the app is change the set temperature or get an alarm if the door is open for too long. Even if it had the features I wanted, it speaks its own language to its own special app so I couldn't access the data in a way that lets me use it.   Alternatively, my thermostat has both Alexa control *and* an API that I can use to access its data. Because of that API, I can write programs to analyze the data for me. I use a program someone else wrote to keep track of how my A/C is performing and to help me understand if it needs maintenance. This is a good thing!   Obviously people are concerned about security. There's a long way to go on that front.   In theory, some day, I'll be able to run ONE application that manages all of my devices. Where we are now, that's a bit of a pipe dream. Google has its own thing, Amazon has its own thing, Apple has its own thing, and a dozen vendors have their own thing. If you shop around you can find devices compatible with multiple, but those tend to cost a little more.",

    "answer": "The general concept is that you change the content of your web page so that search engines will more often find that page when people search for relevant terms. You could also make sure relevant web pages link to your page as well. The simplest way to do SEO is to make sure the web page does mention any relevant search terms even though the content might not specify everything explicitly. So get out your synonim dictionary and get to work. You do not have to mention these terms directly in the content. You can add them all as a cluster on the end and make them invisible or almost invisible. You may notice web pages often have a bunch of different keywords at the end linking to pages showing other articles with the same keywords. The search engines will look at those as if they were actual useful links. In addition there is a hidden metadata field in the HTML header which is explicitly for search engine optimization and allows you to put a bunch of relevant search terms in there to help out the search engines point people to your site.  In general SEO is a big and complex industry. It is often a war between the search engines trying to give their users relevant content and the SEO companies trying to promote their content. The exact technique used by the search engiens to prioritize content is therefore secret but with some experimentation you might be able to figure out some of it.",

    "question": "ELI5: Given the many layers of checks and balances in the court system, how can 1-5% of innocent people end up in prison for crimes they didn\u2019t commit?",
    "answer": "Human error has a lot to do with this, really. Even after taking out all the biases people have in general, such as accusing someone based off their physical appearance, and a lot of circumstantial evidence making a case, you'd still get those wrongful convictions (probably a lot less, but you'd still get them.)  There are two major causes of these.  The first one is the fact that human memory is complete and utter garbage, and can be modified by repetition of alternate facts. This has been proven time and time again, where a police officer repeatedly smashing you with facts about a crime you didn't commit, may lead you to believe you actually did.  This further extends to dubious and faulty memory of events. Many wrongful convictions depend on witnesses misidentifying the culprit, as their brain sees the accused, and if they look close enough to the actual culprit, they will identify them as if they were, because minute differences do not register unless you put the two side by side. Likewise, other details may be super vague, and mis-remembered or misquoted. Often, all you remember is \"the man robbed a bank, and he looked a bit like this\", because your brain needs to remember this for survival reasons, but the rest of the details won't even be remotely in there. This explains the reason why if you are in a similar situation to a crime, you will be also suddenly a bit more anxious, as if the crime was about to happen again. Survival instinct is a fickle thing that hurts all this stuff.  And then, we get to the second major cause: Plea deals. This one is probably the biggest culprit, and it basically goes like this.  You get arrested for (let's say) drug trafficking charges. You know you didn't do it, but somehow, they found a pound of cocaine in your car. While you're struggling with the confusion of \"how the hell did that get there\", and \"who the hell do you know might have left it there for you to be screwed over\", an officer comes in for interrogation, and tries to coax a confession out of you. They say they found the cocaine, they say that through a few contacts, they have witnesses to say you're guilty, and to boot, they found your fingerprints on the cocaine's bag.  After a few hours of back and forth and forth and back of you telling them you wouldn't even know where to get cocaine, and them saying that they have all this evidence, the confession is only a formality at this point, but they still want it, because \"confessing goes a long way in reducing your sentence\", since it means you admit and know that what you did was wrong... Well, they drop in the bomb: If you admit that it is your cocaine, they can drop the charge from drug trafficking, to drug possession, whose sentence is much lighter, so that's sort of meeting halfway. Tired, annoyed, and honestly just wanting to be done with this, you accept the deal, write and sign a confession, and they send you either to the station's cell, or home (often with bail), awaiting the formality that is the trial.  At this point, they have everything they need: They have heavily circumstantial evidence, that is corroborated by you confessing. Suddenly, you get a year in jail for a crime you don't even know how to commit, because honestly, it's better than the alternative of being in jail for drug trafficking... And that's how you got wrongfully convicted.  That kind of scenario happens a lot more often than you probably think, with more and more police officers being caught planting evidence they \"find\" in a car they are ssearching (often illegally) thanks to their body cams. This can also land the same way with murder, but the steps that have to be taken are very different, since there isn't really a step down they usually get you to in order to get there.  Those are the main two culprits of wrongful convictions.",

    "answer": "There's a lot of hardware that you'll pass through, and most of it you have no way of even knowing.

However, that doesn't even tell you the number of routers, since technologies like MPLS let a service provider create a pseudo-routing-shortcut through their network from one edge to another, which can bypass the TTL mechanism in the intermediary steps.  Then you have various switches and signal boosters along the way, which are also going to be transparent.   At the same time, you could be going through \"virtual\" devices.

They will have a lower resting heart rate, and improved energy levels over someone who is more sedentary. They are at greater risk for joint injury, but proper supplements and weight exercise can mitigate these effects. As far as pulmonary health in concerned, if they\u2019re not actively smoking or contributing to worsening their lung health, it should improve health in this regard, even going so far as to reverse some of the harmful effects of past smoking.

And that's not all, those devices produce a lot of heat too. So mining rigs will require industrial-scale cooling systems to keep the processing units from overheating and catching fire.

But wait! A rival bank wants to offer 50% interest TWICE a year if you bank with them. At first, you may think that 50% twice = 100% once, but that isn't the case. After 6 months with this bank, your total + interest will be $1.50. Then another 6 months later it would be $2.25, getting $0.75 from 50% of the $1.50.  So it would seem that even if the % interest adds to the same 100%, getting it more often leads to giving you more money! So what about a bank that offers 25% interest every 3 months? Or 8.3% every month? How about an inconceivablely small percentage interest at every fraction of a millisecond throughout the year?

    "answer": "While it's hard to prove one way or the other, there have been sites discovered where interbreeding was found in the remains. Socially, that implies that a hybrid neanderthal-human individual was not only possible, but that such individuals were accepted parts of their community and lived until adulthood (implying they weren't too weak or sickly to survive). Depending on ancestry there's also a very high likelihood that a given individual will carry the markers of minor neanderthal  additions to their genes. It's much lower in sub-Saharan groups, much higher in Eurasian, because neanderthals really didn't backtrack from Eurasia into Africa once they evolved.  There's also a high margin of human-caused extinction through out-competing them. Tools known to be made by neanderthals as opposed to modern human ancestors don't show many significant changes over an astoundingly long time- We were figuring out how to make better tools, they weren't. With better tools, we had better living. Eventually, it's suggested, there just became more and more of us, less and less of them, until we were all that was left.   More like neighborhood gentrification, and less of an explicit war where two groups met on a battlefield and murdered each other to death.     There's also an argument to be made for climate change as a cause. It's a theory that's getting stronger and stronger in regards to Pleistocene megafauna (with the exception of australia); that it wasn't just anthropocentric, and as the ice age ended, biomes changed. Eventually they changed to a point of not being able to support the megafauna.... Or the neanderthals.     There are a lot of factors at play, and we really aren't at a place where we can point to any one of them and say \"That. That's why.\", all we can do is extrapolate from the evidence we have and keep piecing things together as new discoveries are made.     \\--Of Note; I don't have a Ph.D or anything, I just never outgrew the 'dinosaur' phase..",

    "question": "Eli5: why do most vehicles use two wheel drive and not all wheel drive?",
    "answer": "The short answer is because it's a lot easier and cheaper to design cars that way.  Most modern cars are front wheel drive with the engine mounted sideways in the front with a trans-axle connecting it to the wheels.   This has the advantage that you don't need a drive shaft running through the length of the car. The engine and transmission can also be installed as a compact unit which makes assembly easier and faster.  All the engine weight also pushes down on the drive wheels which helps with traction and braking and therefore makes the car safer.  Making cars 4 wheel drive requires a much more complex transmission with a drive shaft to the rear as well as the front. This adds cost and complexity and has some disadvantages as well, but the manufacturer believes the upsides outweigh the downsides.",

    "question": "ELI5 \u201cHot Hands\u201d or other hand warmers - how do they work/ how are they safe?",
    "answer": "There are different types, but one uses sodium acetate dissolved in water. It's a super-saturated solution, meaning that really there is more stuff dissolved in the water than the water would \"like\". So the sodium acetates \"wants\" to start come out of solution and form solid crystals. To start growing a crystal, though, you need a *nucleation site*, some little bit of something that the first sodium acetate molecules can latch onto and then gather into a crystal from there. Without a nucleation site, the sodium acetate stays in its super-saturated solution.  The hand warmer packet contains this solution along with a little strip of metal. If you bend this strip, little bits of metal come off and these provide nucleation sites for the crystals to start growing. This crystallization process is an *exothermic*, i.e. heat-releasing, reaction.  How did the heat get there? Well, to create a super-saturated solution, you need to dissolve the sodium acetate in hot water (which can hold more stuff in solution) and then let it cool. Some of the heat you put in gets stored in the solution - the heat that was necessary to get it super-saturated (in other words, the solution reaction was *endothermic*). When the excess sodium acetate crystallizes, the heat energy stored in the solution is released.  As to why it is safe, you can calculate how much heat energy will be released and thus how  hot the hand warmer will get. So you can ensure that the temperature will be in a safe range. There's no danger of a \"runaway\" reaction since you know exactly how much sodium acetate you dissolved and how much solution you put in the packet.",

Typically a developer/builder would create a small community of homes, when you bought a property from them you would have to sign a contract agreeing to their terms. For example that you wouldn't paint the house neon orange or start collected rusted out trash cars on your lawn. Remember, they still have other properties to sell and they don't want you to trash your house and prevent them from getting a good deal selling the other homes. Eventually the builder will sell all the properties and the contract you signed gets handed off into a HOA made up of the owners of the various properties.  Eventually, anyone you sell your home to will have to sign the same contract as part of the purchase of the home. So it's legal because you willingly and freely signed a contract with mutual benefits.

    "answer": "Firstly the main purpose of a space station is to do microgravity research. Launching a big expensive space station just to simulate Earth conditions would be counter productive in this setting.  There have however been a few suggestions for how to create artificial gravity by spinning up parts or the entire space station and create centrifugal forces that simulate gravity. There are however issues such as possible oscillations, how to dock with such a space station, how to interface rotating and stationary components, etc.  In fact there was a big centrifuge module constructed for the ISS. The purpose was to be able to simulate Lunar or Mars gravity for research programs, test out designs for centrifugal space stations, conduct control experiments in space, and so on. But due to issues with balancing such a huge rotating mass inside a fragile space station it was limited in size and was not big enough for humans, only rodents and plants. Sadly due to issues with funding and delays in the construction of ISS this module was parked in a parking lot in Japan and have not moved in over twenty years.  There is currently some suggestions for one of research missions with the new cheaper spacecraft that have come on the market the last decade. The plans usually involves tying a long tether between the spacecraft and the upper stage booster that put it in orbit. This configuration could then be spun up using the thrusters and therefore generating a nice stable simulated gravity at very low cost. This could be used for low gravity research, something we currently are unable to do, or even to create gravity for transit missions to Mars.",

    "answer": "The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon is actually a term for 'frequency illusion', a type of cognitive bias your mind creates. To understand this, you need to know a little about cognitive bias as a whole. Though there's a whole lot of nuisances caused by cognitive bias, in short, it\u2019s when your mind deviates from normal, rational thought and starts to make up patterns based off of nonsense.   \u2026frequency illusion is, in fact, two different processes happening at the same time: selective attention and confirmation bias.  The first process, selective attention, comes about when you learn anything new. Basically, when you learn something new, it stays fresh in your mind - you\u2019re paying more attention to it than other things. Because of this, you see it more often when going about your daily life.  However, this very simple, logical process is amped up by confirmation bias, which is a cognitive bias that makes you \"search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions, leading to statistical errors\", reports ScienceDaily.  This means that your mind is on the look-out for newly learned information because it\u2019s still super fresh and interesting to you. At the same time, your mind sees these new words everywhere, thinks that it's weird, and tries to make it fit into some rational system.  In other words, because the information is new, you suddenly force yourself to believe that it's new to everyone and has suddenly popped up, when in reality, you\u2019ve just stopped ignoring it.  You actually see new words more often and believe there\u2019s some weird pattern at work because your mind is trying to make sense of new information.

If both the token and the application that want authorization do the same calculations using that same initial condition, then at any time in the future, they can get the same answer and compare it. This means they know that they were the ones that synced earlier.  If the timekeeping on either device is out of sync, then when you say that the code right now should be \"ABCXYZ\", the other end might think \"No, right now it's supposed to be 'QWERTY'\". Being out of sync means that the trust is gone.  Depending on the system, you put some tolerances in it (i.e., you allow the token to be from N-1 to N+1 iterations out of sync), but that's mostly for user experience purposes. If you're truly getting out of sync, then odds are you will eventually hit N-2 or N+2 and be completely out of sync.  As for how, it depends on the system. If it's something like a Google Authenticator One Time Password system, if the time is *currently* incorrect on either device, then they won't get the right answer. With something like an actual RSA keyfob, those have their own clocks in them. If that clock is ever inaccurate, then it can gain or lose time.

    "question": "ELI5 If time is a dimension, why can you only go in one direction?",
    "answer": "Ok, so this is far from a fully accepted theory, but it *is* a theory, and based off some very well-accepted theories.   In General Relativity, you don\u2019t really \u201cmove\u201d through time. Instead, you *are* at all points in time.   As an example with lower dimensions so we can understand it intuitively, imagine a pen moving left and right. Then, as time progresses, you move the page downward under the pen, leaving a line on that page.   The left/right position of that line on the paper represents the spacial position of the pen, while the up/down position represents the temporal position of the pen.   If you look at a single horizontal slice of that line, and you move the horizontal slice upwards at a steady rate, you will see what *looks* like a point moving left and right, imitating the path that your pen took.   But you know that the horizontal slice giving the motion of the pen is actually only a slice of the full picture. In fact, the ink of the pen makes a full line. It just *exists* in both time and space. It\u2019s not moving, it\u2019s not going forward or backward, it\u2019s just a line sitting there.   The only way to see motion from this line is by only looking at a single moving slice - a single moment in time - at any given instant.   This is what happens in real life. You are a 4-dimensional, static line through spacetime. The reason you seem to move, think, and be dynamic in any way is because you\u2019re experiencing a single slice of time, a single instant in your \u201cworldline\u201d (that\u2019s the real name for it), and that slice of time you experience is moving forward through time at 1 second per second.   Ok, but here\u2019s where it gets really weird.   How do you know that you\u2019re progressing through time? You\u2019re only ever living in the exact present, it\u2019s not like you have a sense that tells you time is passing, so how do you know it is?  Generally, the response is that you remember all the past instants in time, right? That layer of recent memories tells you you\u2019re moving through time, forming new memories.   But (assuming we accept that memories are due to some arrangement of matter in your brain, and not caused by magic or spirits or whatever), there\u2019s absolutely no way for you to differentiate between actually progressing through time and developing new memories, or just being a static entity that can\u2019t move, or do anything, that\u2019s stuck in a single instant in time, but with memories from all the previous instants.   Essentially, the idea is you aren\u2019t moving through time, you\u2019re stuck in this exact moment, but with the *memories* in your brain telling you that you are moving through time.   So now, the question isn\u2019t \u201cwhy are we only moving in one direction through time\u201d because in fact, you aren\u2019t moving through time at all. You\u2019re just a single static slice of your 4-dimensional worldline with the memories making you *think* you\u2019re moving through time. Rather, the question is \u201cwhy do we only remember the past, and not the future\u201d.   And the general idea for that is because of entropy. Let\u2019s pretend that your brain is a watermelon, and you\u2019re trying to remember a hammer that\u2019s coming to smash that watermelon.   Now, theoretically, it\u2019s within the laws of physics for a smashed watermelon to spontaneously bounce off the ground, join together, and throw a hammer into the air. It\u2019s *possible*, but insanely unlikely, because every one of billions of trillions of particles would have to vibrate in exactly the right way at the right time to accomplish that.   On the other hand, it\u2019s *very* likely for a watermelon hit by a hammer to spontaneously smash. That\u2019s something that increases entropy, and you have common sense to realize that would happen.

If we see an *unsmashed* watermelon though, you can\u2019t conclude \u201cthis watermelon probably solidified from many small chunks of watermelon on the ground and threw a hammer into the air\u201d.   In a way, you can say a smashed watermelon \u201cremembers\u201d into the past that it was hit by a hammer.   On the other hand, a solid watermelon can\u2019t \u201cremember\u201d into the future that it *will be* smashed, because the probability that a solid, unsmashed watermelon corresponds to being hit by a hammer in the future is so vanishingly small.   Your brain is basically that watermelon. It can\u2019t remember into the future because it\u2019s so insanely unlikely that a brain affected by the future would somehow reverse every process required to, for example, erase a memory, send the signal back down the optic nerve, causing your cones to yeet out photons into space.   **TL;DR:** *You don\u2019t move through time at all, you\u2019re stuck in time with memory of the past.

    "answer": "The whites of your eyes have little to do with what you actually see. The pupil of your eyes is responsible for receiving light and transmitting it to the brain to be perceived as vision.  Squinting changes the angle of the lens of your eye overlying the pupil, causing light to be refracted differently to certain areas inside of your eye, some of which are better at detecting brightness of light, while others are better at detecting color and overall acuity (sharpness) of an image.   If you wear glasses for nearsightedness (trouble with distance vision), you can actually improve your distance vision slightly through squinting -- it bends the light in a way that partially corrects the lens abnormality in nearsightedness. If you only have a mild case of nearsightedness, squinting can almost correct it entirely (but will cause eye strain and other issues doing it all the time). All your glasses (or contact lenses) do in these situations is add another lens with a correction factor to cancel out what your lens isn't doing properly and hence correct your vision.",

A union is supposed to represent the needs of the workers as a group when dealing with management.     A union will negotiate a contract, rules of work, pay, hours, benefits with the company.    Unions create division and stress in the workplace between management and workers because workers no longer do whatever they are told, they only do what is spelled out in the contract ( for example, a contract may state that the worker can refuse overtime, a manager might need someone to work overtime, the worker has the right to refuse, the worker might need the money, his union brothers might not want anyone to work overtime, leaving the worker with a moral dilemma)    I find that unions are good if the job is a skilled trade.

    "answer": "The general concept is that you change the content of your web page so that search engines will more often find that page when people search for relevant terms. You could also make sure relevant web pages link to your page as well. The simplest way to do SEO is to make sure the web page does mention any relevant search terms even though the content might not specify everything explicitly. So get out your synonim dictionary and get to work. You do not have to mention these terms directly in the content. You can add them all as a cluster on the end and make them invisible or almost invisible. You may notice web pages often have a bunch of different keywords at the end linking to pages showing other articles with the same keywords. The search engines will look at those as if they were actual useful links. In addition there is a hidden metadata field in the HTML header which is explicitly for search engine optimization and allows you to put a bunch of relevant search terms in there to help out the search engines point people to your site.  In general SEO is a big and complex industry. It is often a war between the search engines trying to give their users relevant content and the SEO companies trying to promote their content.

So a bottle is sitting there with almost no oxygen and no living germs - it can last for a long time without going bad.   But as soon as you open the seal, you allow air in and air has oxygen and germs floating around, so the sauce might go bad in a few days.

Even though it is light like gamma it doesn\u2019t carry enough energy to knock electrons out of place (this is called Ionization) thus making it pretty much harmless.

So you take your YFG-HA gene, put it into a vector for expression, and put that vector into cells.  Your gene gets transcribed and translated by the cells that have your vector, and they make a whole bunch of YFG-HA protein.  Now, how to purify it?  First, you burst all your cells with soap and shred them apart into a uniform protein soup.  Then, you take an antibody against the HA tag which binds it tightly, and you stick a coating of that antibody to tiny sand-sized plastic beads. You put those beads into a column, and run your protein soup through it. Your YFG-HA protein sticks to the antibodies on the beads while everything else runs through.  You put a few rinses of fluid through the plastic sand to really clean up those YFG-HA proteins trapped in there, then you run a different liquid through that breaks the antibody's bond to the HA tag, and you flush out a clean and pure solution of YFG-HA protein.",

    "answer": "\"Meat\" isn't just muscle flesh from an animal.  There is a very rapid aging process that occurs in meat shortly after an animal dies.  Depending on the animal's health and stress level at the time it died, you end up with with one of three outcomes:  1) PSE meat, which is light colored and spongy  2) Normal meat, which is the stuff you find in your supermarket  3) DFD meat, which is dark, tough, and has the \"gamey\" taste people associate with non-traditional animals.  The taste itself is the result of the meat being less acidic than normal meat.  Animals killed on a large, commercial farm will be in good health and are killed instantly, so that the animal doesn't experience any stress while dying.  This results in mostly normal meat being produced from their carcasses.  There will be some PSE and DFD meat but it either gets turned into pet food or thrown out.  When people go out and hunt meat they're killing animals that are typically in poor health and/or which are under a lot of stress (if for no other reason than that getting shot and slowly bleeding to death is stressful).  This almost always produces DFD meat.  Because people associate game animals with the gamey taste of DFD meat, some ranches that grow those animals commercially will deliberately produce DFD meat to maintain the gamey taste that people expect.    But if you were to kill a game animal in the same manner as a domestic animal (IE, killing it instantaneously when at peak physical condition) then it would taste pretty similar to the meat from domestic animals.",

It seems to me that this is less secure than an old chipless card that at least requires a PIN.",
    "answer": "The chip and/or the PIN are a means of verifying the transaction is legit.  On a card without the chip, the only data is its number, the expiration date, and maybe the verification code on the back. The magnetic stripe is usually just the card number. These kinds of terminals require the PIN because (hopefully) only the authorized cardholder knows that PIN. These cards are easy to duplicate so we NEED extra security measures.  Cards with a chip, on the other hand, are a lot harder to replicate. The chip is actually a tiny computer that does some math on some inputs and generates numbers in a way that isn't easy to guess even if you see it done for a few thousand inputs. The bank who issues the card knows the secret information that makes it possible to predict the numbers. So, oversimplified, when you use a chip reader, the terminal gives the chip some inputs, gets the chip's result, then sends the inputs and the results to the bank. The bank verifies that the inputs should produce that output on your chip. So in a way, the chip IS the PIN, but it's more secure than that because you can't accidentally give someone knowledge that makes them able to replicate your chip.  It's probably possible to copy a card with a chip, but it would take a high degree of sophistication and someone would have to physically steal your card to do it. You can't reproduce the chip from observing a single read, and in theory even seeing hundreds of thousands of input/output wouldn't be useful. Because it's incredibly close to impossible to duplicate these chips, when a terminal uses the chip as an ID you don't have to use a PIN. The assumption is it means someone would've had to have stolen your actual card and you'd probably notice that much more quickly than it takes to figure out someone's skimmed a traditional card.",

    "answer": "That is basically an age-old battle between power generation and power consumption.  For solar energy you need space and sun. Lots of it actually, and while in some countries the weather pattern is enough for solar generation, in many countries solar energy on a private site like a normal house can only supply X percentage of your daily / yearly consumption. This is of course still a major benefit, hence more and more buildings incorporate some kind of regenerative system (even only to reduce normal energy costs by a few percent).  For cars however this is a bit problematic, as the space on a car roof is simply way too small to generate energy to generate enough energy efficiently enough to power batteries ... not even considering tunnels, bad weather, being in a garage or roofed parking lot, inside the shadows of skyscrapers in a city or a forest etc. You can optimize your solar energy generation at your home. You cannot do that nearly as good for a car.  Now in theory they can at least supply a bit of energy, but the next issue would be the price. For a building costing hundreds of thousands of EUR the price for a solar system is relatively low (compared to the building price). For a car, the relative price would be much higher, noticeably increasing the cars price ... and e-cars are trying to make their way in an extremely competitive environment, where even a few hundred EUR can already influence the purchase decision of a buyer.   Last but not least: cars are designed in their form and looks with specific goals in mind (good looks, areodynamics etc). Commercial solar panels cannot (yet) be brought into the form necessary for a seamless integration in the often curved roof or an engine hood. There are some developments where solar cells can be formed like plastics, but IIRC they are still a bit out of range of normal, large scale, commercial use.  In the end solar generation integrated into the hull of a vehicle will be coming, but only to supply some additional energy for onboard equipment like radios, lights etc.  SYL",

That sensation is electric impulses traveling from neuron to neuron in a specific, complex network that your brain accepts and registers as \u201cpink\u201d. However, during the travel of the electric impulse, your neurons release certain chemicals, and those chemicals need to be restored. This is known as \u201creuptake.\u201d  Thus, when you first think \u201cpink,\u201d all the neurons used to create that thought are all strong and ready to give you a nice, strong, comprehensive, and clear idea of pink.

Duly note; neurons firing is like a gun firing; they either do or don\u2019t. They can\u2019t half fire and create a weak image.

To some extent, it really is a matter of developers learning to use the hardware more effectively. This is a process that never really stops, and it leads to incremental improvement over time, to a limited degree.  But you mentioned how Sony and Microsoft released hardware upgrades for the PS4 and XBone, and this leads to the other big reason: hardware upgrades to a cobsole's capabilities are not as new as many people think. The main difference is that with disc and digital consoles, these upgrades generally require you to buy a new console or at least swap out bits of the hardware: you can't put more RAM on a disc or download a better video processor.  But on the older cartridge-based systems, hardware upgrades were often built into the games themselves. The NES is especially notorious for its proliferation of different kinds of upgrade chips. Nintendo called most of its upgrades Memory Management Controllers (MMCs), but in a more general sense people call them mappers now. There were limits to what a mapper could do -an NES is still an NES- but these were used to enhance memory, add features like split-screen and larger sprites, and on the Famicom it was even possible to enhance the games' sound (this last didn't work on the NES because of some foolish early decisions on NOA's part).

    "answer": "Your whole body actually prefers to sleep a bit cold. Studies have shown that keeping your thermostat at about 65 degrees Fahrenheit is optimal for the deepest sleep. Also, apparently keeping a cool head allows your body to expel heat more effectively (understandably). Since keeping your body warm takes energy and sort of defeats the purpose of sleep (that being to rest), we can imagine why we want to expel this heat. The body temperature we keep while awake is such because our chemical reactions and electrical signals in our body happen most efficiently at these temperatures. We don\u2019t really need to be think and act while asleep, so this conservation of energy while resting makes sense.   So body saves energy and rests easier by being a bit colder. Keeping a cool head is important to expel heat.

    "answer": "All motion and momentum is relative. If rain is falling straight down, and you are driving your car 60 mph on the highway, it's essentially the exact same as if your car was sitting still, but the rain was moving horizontally toward your car at 60 mph in addition to how fast it's falling in a downward direction.  So, because the maximum speed at which rain falls is about 20-25 miles per hour (depending on the size of the rain droplet), and the rain is effectively moving 60 mph to the side compared to your car at the same time, the angle that the rain is moving is actually closer to being a flat horizontal line than a straight vertical line, thus making it difficult for it to hit the back window of your car.",

    "answer": "Forgive me if any of this is off, I took the applicable courses for this like 20 years ago, so probably don't remember everything. But in essence:   Metabolism is the process by which your body converts what you eat and drink into energy. Calories are combined with oxygen to release the energy your body needs to function. You burn calories even while at rest, in order to supply the energy your body needs. The number of calories your body uses to carry out these basic functions is known as your basal metabolic rate. In addition to your basal metabolic rate, two other factors determine how many calories your body burns each day (Food processing (thermogenesis) and Physical activity). A portion of calories not burned through these processes is converted into glycogens (sugar essentially), which are easily accessed and metabolised first. The rest are stored by your body in the form of fat, which is retained to supply energy when there aren't enough other nutrients available.  The weight of calorie dense foods does not translate into the amount of weight gained. That weight is determined by the amount of extra calories stored by your body. To translate this into numbers, each gram of carbohydrate and protein yield 4 calories. Each gram of fat yields 9 calories. The human body needs to burn about 4100 calories to burn that lbs of fat, which will only happen if there are no other easily accessible calories (like glycogens) available.  So, if you consume something calorie dense that exceeds the number of calories your body needs to function, the rest will be stored as fat. Do this often enough, and you'll gain weight.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why did people on the Oregon Trail not plan to stop sooner?",
    "answer": "At the time the Oregon trail was popular it was made popular by mountain men and fur traders so there was an established economy and hope of \u201cwealth\u201d in the far west of the United states. Most of those were by foot and horse back. Later just before the gold rush the first few wagon trains left from Missouri. And later Nebraska. So most folks were already stopping earlier anyways. Later once the gold rush had boomed the \u201cOregon trail\u201d had become the more established and  was the more widely used passage over the Rockies And the Sierra Nevada mountains. Travelers then went south from \u201cOregon\u201d into California.(when the turned south it really wasn\u2019t in Oregon for most travelers) And by the time the gold rush happened and the chase for the gold and ultimate wealth happened no one was stopping anywhere until they got to California. In the early days of the Oregon trail most of the fur trappers and mountain men went north into the heart of the Oregon territory and what became modern day Washington.   But the gold rush period and the results of it,  is what made popular what most people think of the Oregon trail.   Little known facts. HWY 80 going west, and then most of the highways in the west were a result of the first and the most popular routes taken by the pioneers. With many spots of the trail being maintained by entrepreneurial land owners who make the trails nice and charge a small toll to use the path. Many people paid because it made the travel that much easier and faster. Eventually the sections of trail where so highly used, known about and maintained that they became roads and then US and state highways.   Also, once the gold rush happened other routes over the Sierra\u2019s where investigated and a new \u201csouthern\u201d route was found going through modern day Reno and over Donner Summit. Made popular by the Donner Party who became trapped by a great snow storm.  Most of the people in the Donner party died as a result of the snow and were then eaten by other members of their party to survive.  (I have some stories about why the Donner party was caught in the mountains so late in the year as well, but thats for another post)   Also, The section of Trail just before the mountain pass ,(roughly between Elko Nevada and Reno) dubbed the 40 mile desert because it was roughly 40 miles long became the most deadly section of the entire trail from the east coast to California. Due to its high amount of predator animals, lack of game animals, high swings in temperatures and weather as well as lack of good water sources killed more people in that stretch than anywhere else on the westward pioneer trail.   History lesson aside, the long and short of it, as I\u2019ve been told and have studied is that most people where so driven on either greed or promises and stories of a better life that they were hell bent on getting to the \u201cpromised land\u201d of the west coast. Some made it. Many died trying and Im assuming many more just gave up along the way.",

Instead, water causes refraction.....when light hits water it slows down, this slow down changes the direction light is traveling.    In the case of a pool, the surface often has some waves to it...even if they're really tiny waves and it looks completely still it's likely still moving to some degree. This movement causes light to constantly be drawn in different directions as it passes through the surface of the water. This constantly changing direction of light acts almost like a disco ball, causing high and low amounts of light to hit different parts of the floor at the same time, which causes dark and light spots to appear, creating \"shadows\".    ELI5: Water rarely sits still and is always telling the light to go a different way. The light does what it's told which causes bright and dark spots to appear.",

Sometimes the standard algorithm is the most efficient method, but more often than not, there is a more efficient way of solving a problem.  For example, when I ask an adult to solve 12 x 99, they almost always line up the numbers and perform the standard algorithm.  When I ask a student who has been taught to think multiplicatively, they can almost alway do this in their head by multiplying 12 x 100 and then subtracting 12. Both methods are valid, but the student's method was more efficient.  If we only teach our students the standard algorithms, we are cheating them out of the opportunity to learn and think about the relationships between numbers and their operations.

I'm sure other redditors will go into greater detail but your controls are far more complex and if you are relying on the auto pilot you need to understand how to read and program that specific autopilot exactly. You can't learn to fly a Boeing 737-400 and then go fly a Boeing 737-800 - you'd have to go specifically retrain (Boeing 737NG course).  Navigation: In a car you are driving on a road with road markings and road signs and nowadays with extremely an useful GPS lady to guide you along. A huge part of flying is navigating as there's no signs up in the air to guide you along. And with weather conditions you have to learn to navigate by instrumentation alone.  Radio: This is the reason I could never be a pilot - I do not understand what is being said over the radio and you cannot fly safely without having proper communication and radio discipline. You have to be listening closely at **all** times because there's no way to fly safely without listening out for air traffic control constantly.  Safety: If your aircraft experiences any problem in air you can't simple pull over and open the hood. Therefore every single of aspect of flying involves safety checks and doublechecks.

It seems to me that this is less secure than an old chipless card that at least requires a PIN.",
    "answer": "The chip and/or the PIN are a means of verifying the transaction is legit.  On a card without the chip, the only data is its number, the expiration date, and maybe the verification code on the back. The magnetic stripe is usually just the card number. These kinds of terminals require the PIN because (hopefully) only the authorized cardholder knows that PIN. These cards are easy to duplicate so we NEED extra security measures.  Cards with a chip, on the other hand, are a lot harder to replicate. The chip is actually a tiny computer that does some math on some inputs and generates numbers in a way that isn't easy to guess even if you see it done for a few thousand inputs. The bank who issues the card knows the secret information that makes it possible to predict the numbers. So, oversimplified, when you use a chip reader, the terminal gives the chip some inputs, gets the chip's result, then sends the inputs and the results to the bank. The bank verifies that the inputs should produce that output on your chip. So in a way, the chip IS the PIN, but it's more secure than that because you can't accidentally give someone knowledge that makes them able to replicate your chip.  It's probably possible to copy a card with a chip, but it would take a high degree of sophistication and someone would have to physically steal your card to do it. You can't reproduce the chip from observing a single read, and in theory even seeing hundreds of thousands of input/output wouldn't be useful. Because it's incredibly close to impossible to duplicate these chips, when a terminal uses the chip as an ID you don't have to use a PIN. The assumption is it means someone would've had to have stolen your actual card and you'd probably notice that much more quickly than it takes to figure out someone's skimmed a traditional card.",

    "answer": "Static friction is dependent on normal force (force against the wall) and the materials of the object and wall (represented as \u0173 the friction coefficient). If the materials are grippy enough that the force applied (N) multiplied by \u0173 is greater than the objects weight (W) then it will be easier to push against the wall than to hold it up.  Mathematically it looks like this: F = N*\u0173 If W < F it will be easier If W > F you're better off holding the object.  Common values for \u0173 are 0.2-0.5.  Note that the friction coefficient decreases if the object starts moving, because dynamic friction isn't as strong as static friction. This is exactly why it's not as safe to screech to a stop when driving.",

If the speaker and microphone are a metre apart (say, between your monitor and a headset mic) then that \"fundamental\" frequency would be 330Hz (sound travels at about 330 metres per second in air) which sounds like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX8KZx5RDg8)  This isn't all that high pitched, but that's where *harmonics* come in!  Any sound at a frequency that's a simple multiple of the main harmonic (e.g. 2x330=660Hz, 3x330=990Hz etc.) will *also* be repeated.  Most usually, the sound that triggers this kind of feedback is a fairly sharp click noise, such as you get when you plug something in. These sounds have *lots* of high frequency components, and any of these that are a multiple of the fundamental will join in the feedback party.  Why do we only hear the high frequencies? Because there are only a couple of \"low\" frequencies that are multiples of that fundamental, and far more at higher frequencies.  Human hearing spans around 20Hz-20KHz, so the feedback would likely include 330, 660, 990, all the way up to 19,800Hz (maybe higher depending on your hearing)  That's a total of around 60 different frequencies, and only the first few would sound \"low\" - the highest ones would be fairly painful to hear at any volume.",

    "question": "eli5: is electron and volt produce at the same time ?",
    "answer": "There are two types of charges usually denoted as positive and negative and equal charges repel each other while opposite charges attract each other.  Now electrons are basically the fundamental particles that carry the negative charge and they also happen to be the ones that are moving. Positive charges usually are found with protons in the core of the atoms which usually remain stationary.  Now under normal conditions atoms are not charged because there are as many positively charged particles as there are negatively charged particles. So a charged atom or ion, usually has either too many or too few electrons and thus carries a net charged.  So if it has too many electrons in it's vincinity would like to make it neutral again, because they are attracted to the positive charge whereas if it has too many electrons, then those would like to get away from the other electrons and move to some place with less electrons.  So if you have a copper wire and on one end you put loads of stuff in need of electrons and on the other end you put something with loads of electrons then the electrons in the wire will try to move from one end to the other. So something like this:  \\+1 - 0 - 0 -0 - 0 - (-1)  So +1 is your positive end and (-1) is your negative end and the \"-0-\" are neutral pieces in this chain/wire. So in the next step one electron will move to the open place at the positive end and leave a vacancy at it's previous place:  0 - (+1) - 0 - 0 -0 (-1)  And so the charge travels from one end to the other. As said it's technically the electrons moving to the left, but you can also pretend as if a positive charge is moving to the right. Which engineers determined to be the way to look at it for historical reasons.  So electrons are usually not created in this process they just move from one atom to the next following the slope of charge. And that slope is called a difference in potential and measured in volt. So if you apply a voltage you basically set up such a difference in electrons on those ends and that makes the electrons move. And btw that movement would then be called a current (how many charge passes a given space per second, meassured in ampere).",

    "answer": "These new laws are intending to deregulate the farmers markets to make it easier for private investors and traders to trade in food products and hopefully increase the productivity of the farmers. However the regulation that was in place was there to protect the farmers and consumers from volatile prices. All countries in the world do regulate food production to some degree. The US and Canada have maybe some of the least regulated markets but it is still regulated fairly much. A vital part of the New Deal plan to get the US out of the depression in the 30s were agricultural regulations. And the US have demonstrated that the markets are unable to handle completely unregulated essential products when they deregulated power production in California during the Enron scandal. So the regulation is important to ensure that farmers will get paid at harvest and that consumers will see food in the stores. The complaint against the Indian government is that the new laws will not be able to do this and even though they will open up the markets to speculators they do not work with the market to ensure a steady supply and demand of food.",

So guessing a time signature that is different from what the sheet music say does not necessarily mean you are wrong.  When identifying the bars you should be listening for the first downbeat of the bar which is often emphasized. So you would count 4/4 as **1**\\-2-3-4-**1**\\-2-3-4-**1**. And this is usually audible in the music. It does not always sound as obvious as in for example waltz but after some practice you should hear this in most songs. And when you listen for this and also for any rhythmic repetitions you should be able to identify a bar and then just count how many beats there is in that bar. So if you hear something like **1**\\-and-2-and-3-and-4-and-5-and-6-**1**\\-and-2- ... you are dealing with a song in 11/8.",

It just means the drivers in the headphones will be able to produce frequencies between 15 and 28kHz, and doesn't have anything to do with the sample rate of the audio from your computer.  The sample rate and bit depth of an audio signal will dictate how perfectly the digital waveform will match the analog one. Say for example, you have a pure sine wave running into a recording interface. This gets converted by an ADC into a digital version. If your sample rate is really bad, it will end up looking like a square wave, or a kind of stepped triangle wave. If its good, it will be really close to a sine wave. Then digital filters can be used to smooth all the sharp edges and make it a nice round wave again.  The sample rate being 2x your sound frequency is the nyquist theorem. It has nothing to do with doubling the frequencies you are hearing or playing back within the audio itself; what it means is if you are only interested in the audio range (up to \\~20kHz), you need at least a 40kHz sample rate to not get any aliasing or artifacts.

    "answer": "The fold in the eyelid you are describing is called the epicanthic fold. it's associated with greater levels of fat deposition around the eyeball, a feature that is the most prominent in native North Siberian, Aleutian and Inuit populations. The extra tissue is thought to provide greater insulation for the eye and sinuses from the effects of cold, especially from freezing winds, and to represent an adaptation to cold climates. That means that in extreme temperatures, their faces would be more protected from sub-zero temperatures which could freeze the nose, lips, eyelids and severely irritate and cause cold injuries to the sinuses. It has also been suggested that the fold itself may provide a level of protection from snow blindness. In extreme periods of cold, those who could see best in blinding sunlight reflecting off of snow and ice could hunt most successfully.  its appearance in peoples of Southeast Asia can be linked to possible descent from cold-adapted ancestors, its occurrence in various African peoples doesn't follow a cold-adaptive explanation for it appearing in the latter groups. The epicanthic fold found in the san African people has been tentatively linked to protection for the eye from the high levels of ultraviolet light found in desert and semi-desert areas. That's not dissimilar to an advantage in snow and ice covered environments.

    "answer": "Iodine is an antiseptic and kills bacteria and viruses. It will have no effect on most chemical contaminants in water, and doesn\u2019t remove anything from the water. It just makes it so germs in the water die before you drink it. Interestingly, exactly why it does this is poorly understood, though it is known that iodine attacks a lot of the chemical compounds that germs need to function.  Iodine does not build up in your body, at least not long term. In fact, iodine is the heaviest element that your body has a use for and you need (very small) amounts of it to live. So some small amount will be incorporated, at least for a bit, into your body and that\u2019s a good thing! If you don\u2019t get enough, you can even get [a disease called \u201ciodine deficiency\u201d](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine_deficiency). Most people in the developed world get enough iodine in their diets to prevent this, and iodine is often added to table salt (because that\u2019s a convenient way to keep it) to ensure this.   Drinking a few drops might cause some burns before it dilutes down. I don\u2019t recommend it.  There exist radioactive isotopes of iodine (and all other elements), but they are not found in nature. Nuclear weapons and accidents can release a lot of these radioactive forms of iodine, though. To help prevent the body from taking up this radioactive iodine and using it, it is normal practice to give people who may be exposed to such a thing a fairly large doses of non-radioactive iodine to outcompete the dangerous, radioactive versions of it in your body.",

It's like shards of glass, you can break them and break them, but no matter how much you keep breaking them, they can still cut.   Prions are bits and pieces of mis folded proteins, and they can get tangled up in our healthy proteins and cause them to become mis folded as well. It's hard to break something that is already broken, which is how we normally sterilize and sanitize.   Prion risk can be managed by preventing contamination in same species situations. For instance if you aren't a cannibal, and you don't grow food in fertilizer made from human waste, then the chances of you getting prions in your system is low.

    "question": "Eli5: Why is data so valuable to companies?",
    "answer": "Data can be used to optimize processes and predict behaviour. The former can lead to significant cost-cutting while the latter can increase sales. On top of that, data can reveal far more than people are willing to share or are even aware of.  For example, most shops are franchises. And most franchises are owned by umbrella corporations or multinationals. That means those corporations can collect data on their customers across a wide variety of stores.  Let's say I have a customer discount card for a supermarket, a clothing store and a drug store all owned by the same corporation. There are hundreds of thousands or even millions of people like me who all shop at those same stores.  Those cards let stores track my purchases. And if I start buying diapers regularly, it's reasonable to assume I had a baby recently.  So if you compare my current shopping pattern over the last 9 months to my shopping pattern over the last two years, you can see how my behaviour changed during my pregnancy.  I stopped drinking alcohol. I changed my meals. I started taking different vitamins. I started buying different kinds of clothes. There are countless clues to my shopping behaviour really.  If you collect this data on thousands or even millions of women that you know are pregnant. You can start identify indicators that very accurately predict which customers are pregnant even though they haven't told you.  Now you can change the advertising you serve these customers with to be specifically targeted at pregnancy-related products. This is much more relevant to their interests than untargeted advertising and as such, more likely to be successful.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg really. Big data analysis can very accurately predict a staggering variety of qualities like sexuality, age, gender, political and cultural leanings and so on.  It works so well that it can accurately predict behavioural factors the person themselves isn't even aware of. Ie. a person might think and say they're fairly liberal but their behaviour indicates that they're much more conservative than they think and as such more sensitive to conservative-leaning messages.  Simply put, your personal behavioural data is more honest about you than you're willing to be, even to yourself. And when you can collect data like that on millions, you start to understand people at a level that people don't even understand themselves or each other.  And with that kind of information, you can craft incredibly powerful manipulation.",

Sometimes it can be caused by head/neck muscles strains.     more ELI5 : **some brain vessels dilated => trigeminal nerve sends information to brainstem that we have some \"brain\" pain => pain**  In migraine, it's usually the same pathway BUT this cranial nerve (trigeminal) is in a \"panic mode\". It reacts so much to this input, that he releases special chemicals (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), P substance etc) that exacerbate blood vessels dilation and cause more inflammation which AGAIN amplifies the vasodilation, leakage of blood vessels, and degranulation of mast cells (immune response) and the sensory input receives this information and makes MORE substances to evoke a more stronger response.  more ELI5: **some brain vessels dilated => trigeminal nerve makes substances that trigger immune response/more vasodilation AND sends information to brainstem that we have some serious \"brain\" pain => big pain => trigeminal nerve makes MORE substances in response to that brainstem response => MORE and WORSE pain.**    And in migraine this cycle can be triggered by diffent stimuli (coffee, low glucose, light, tiredness, lack of sleep etc)   But still the EXACT mechanisms of these condition are not well understood.",

    "answer": "The fold in the eyelid you are describing is called the epicanthic fold. it's associated with greater levels of fat deposition around the eyeball, a feature that is the most prominent in native North Siberian, Aleutian and Inuit populations. The extra tissue is thought to provide greater insulation for the eye and sinuses from the effects of cold, especially from freezing winds, and to represent an adaptation to cold climates. That means that in extreme temperatures, their faces would be more protected from sub-zero temperatures which could freeze the nose, lips, eyelids and severely irritate and cause cold injuries to the sinuses. It has also been suggested that the fold itself may provide a level of protection from snow blindness. In extreme periods of cold, those who could see best in blinding sunlight reflecting off of snow and ice could hunt most successfully.  its appearance in peoples of Southeast Asia can be linked to possible descent from cold-adapted ancestors, its occurrence in various African peoples doesn't follow a cold-adaptive explanation for it appearing in the latter groups. The epicanthic fold found in the san African people has been tentatively linked to protection for the eye from the high levels of ultraviolet light found in desert and semi-desert areas.

However, that doesn't even tell you the number of routers, since technologies like MPLS let a service provider create a pseudo-routing-shortcut through their network from one edge to another, which can bypass the TTL mechanism in the intermediary steps.  Then you have various switches and signal boosters along the way, which are also going to be transparent.   At the same time, you could be going through \"virtual\" devices.

    "question": "ELI5: How does an electron microscope work?",
    "answer": ">I know the machine fires electrons at a sample and the electrons are reflected back.   This is close enough for our purposes.  >How does that translate into a super detailed image?  The important item here is that the level of detail you can resolve depends on the wavelength of what you're bouncing off the target.  You can see finer details if you image in blue light (450nm) than Near IR (2000 nm).  Due to quantum physics being weird, electrons aren't really balls but instead wiggly energy packets that have a wavelength.  There are a bunch of different ways to calculate the wavelength of fundamental particles like electrons but in general its <1nm making it able to show you much much finer detail than light could because it can sneak into nooks and crannies.  If you take a microscope and just keep cranking up the zoom on an optical image, it will get bigger but it will also get blurrier because the little distortions from when the light clipped the edge of the lens and tiny abnormalities of the lenses matter when you're at 1,000,000x zoom.  This is the same reason you can't just zoom wayyyyy in on an 8 inch telescope and see great detail on Pluto, you need a bigger lens and shorter wavelength to let you capture the detail so you can zoom in on it.  Since the electron wavelength is soo much smaller you can zoom in proportionally more before the edge effects matter and blur your image beyond use.  > Why can it only use dead samples?  Because it'd be dead by the time you're sampling it  What happens when you shoot the electron beam?  It smacks into atoms and sends other electrons shooting off to be detected.  If you have air in the chamber that air would catch the electrons before they hit your sample so electron microscopes are all in vacuum chambers and suck all the air out before imaging.  The sample is also generally prepped in a fine layer of carbon or gold to give a nice conductive surface for good imaging.  That wouldn't be particularly great for anything that was alive.  >Also, why is it in black and white?  Because you're better at detecting changes in black/white than in color  All the sensor is getting back is a location on it and how many electrons hit that spot, its effectively only able to judge brightness and can't tell you anything about those electrons.  When you look at a color image its because you want to know the count of how many photons would have triggered your red cones, your green cones, and your blue cones, but if you only have one set of data (photons that hit cones) then grayscale is the right way to represent that  If you need more information about the surface an electron microscope has tools *wayyyy* better than color.  You can put down the little cursor and go \"hey what's this?\" and the system will shoot electrons at it and plot you [the chemical analysis of that spot](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hanan-Youssef-7/publication/272408064/figure/fig3/AS:323999889412099@1454259001358/SEM-and-EDS-chemical-analysis-for-the-Ag-substituted-Ti-Z-A.png) which tells you what its made of and roughly how much of what which is *wayyyyy* better than trying to eyeball the color to tell if its copper or gold",

    "answer": "It's been a long time since I've done this so forgive me any errors or omissions.  You have some substance in a solution. Then you stick electrodes into it and apply voltage to it. You slowly increase the voltage to some set amount over time, then once you get to the max you slowly decrease it back down. The whole time you're measuring how much current flows, which in turn tells you about how much resistance the solution you're analyzing has at each level of voltage. This is generally done by some computerized set up or machine that controls the voltage and measures the current/resistance and plots it on a graph [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_voltammetry#/media/File:Cyclovoltammogram.jpg). It's also generally done several times in a row. So you might go from 0V to 12V (or -9V to 9V or whatever) then back to 0V then back to 12V for several repetitions. This is where the word \"cyclic\" in the name comes from.  So what's the point? Well we're measuring the electrochemical properties of whatever's in the solution. If you get nice smooth line instead of something like that picture I linked above, there's not much interesting going on chemically, it only really tells you about what the electrical resistance of the solution is. In that picture I linked, the substance is undergoing some kind of chemical reaction as the voltage goes up and down, specifically an oxidation-reduction reaction. Those two humps (one hump is oxidation, the other is reduction) going up and down tell you what at what voltage the reaction occurs. The size of the humps (peak current) tells you a bunch of stuff about the reaction that I can't exactly remember at the moment.  There's a number of other things you can measure with this technique (and I'm surely forgetting most of them). One of the interesting ones though is that you can keep running the experiment for a long time having it constantly sweep back and forth. Then you can count how many sweeps it takes until the humps in the graph diminish in size by some appreaciable amount. This gives an idea of how many times the substance your measuring can react back and forth (this is a reversible reaction after all, though if you only get one sweep it means the reaction is not reversible). So, for example, you might be testing some material you want to use for a battery. This measurement gives an idea about how many times that battery could recharge.",

    "answer": "There are two answers. Neither of them very clear. One personally, and two society-wise. Both depend on risk. The first to your self , the second as a group.   Your risk is based on how likely you are to actually cross paths with someone infectious and how likely that is to cause you serious harm. So are you in an at risk group and where are you are considerations.   The second - how likely you are to be part of a chain of infection, how at risk are the people around you and how well society - such as the health service is coping.   Masks not perfect and life always holds a risk. In the West we have never masked up for flu which kills thousands of people a year - around 20,000 in the U.K. annually I think - though we vaccinate the at risk. Possibly COVId may have some nasty long term consequences even if you dint get seriously ill.

    "answer": "There is a point about national debt that helped me understand it better: the debt cannot be recalled whenever the borrower wants. The bonds the government uses to borrow money have fixed terms and interest rates, so all payments are incredibly predictable. The government always knows exactly how much it needs to pay in a given month or year.  It also knows how much it might owe in a given month or year if it takes on 2 trillion dollars in additional  debt to fund covid stimulus or infrastructure.    As long as these predictable payments don't make up a large portion of the budget, it really doesn't matter how big the actual total debt number is.    Problems occurr when a country cannot keep up with it's payments.  At that point, the only option is to print the money, which causes high inflation. Then nobody wants to borrow money from that country anymore, so they have a hard time serving their people after that.  Currently, the US spends about 6% of it's budget on servicing it's debt.

    "question": "ELI5:Why do liquids actually expand volume when turning from liquid to solid, such as water to ice, but academia tells you that molecules condense and save space when going from liquid to solid?",
    "answer": "Most liquids do end up denser as ice (less heat means less vibrating which means denser material).  Water is an exception because its molecules can do hydrogen bonding.  When water is liquid, the molecules are all jumbled up while they're vibrating (imagine wildly shaking a box full of V-shaped puzzle pieces).  The molecules can't make any hydrogen bonds because the vibrating is too strong and they'll break apart.  When water starts to cool off, the molecules do get a little closer together, but there's still too much vibrating to let the hydrogen bonds form (imagine the puzzle pieces are gently shaking themselves into a smaller pile inside the box). But once it's cold enough, there isn't enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds apart. The hydrogen bonds form, which makes all the V-shaped molecules line up neatly in rows, which spaces them apart (like the puzzle put together, which ends up being about 10% bigger than the box they were in).",

    "answer": "A kidney is not like most organs.  You can have \u201cextras\u201d without them interfering in the daily running of your body.   Actually, extra kidneys is good!  You can only have one heart because of the way your body is laid out.  Your heart is kinda in the middle-ish of your body, and all of your blood *has* to go to your heart, make a detour through your lungs to pick up oxygen, and then swish around your body to drop the oxygen off.   If you had two hearts, this carefully-choreographed system just wouldn\u2019t work.  But kidneys.   Kidneys are special.  They\u2019re unusual.   They kinda just float in your abdomen, at the back.   Some people only have one, and some people have three naturally.  It doesn\u2019t make much difference.   Weird, right?  Kidneys filter your blood.   All your blood passes through them, and they push out the excess water and salt, and other dissolved waste products.   This trickles down into your bladder and you pee it out.  Now, you can pretty much attach as many of these kidney tubes as you like to your bladder.   So if a kidney still has some function, there is no reason to cut it out.   It\u2019s helping, even if it is not enough by itself to keep a person alive.   In a person with kidney problems, it\u2019s pertinent to give them every bit of help possible.

    "question": "ELI5 how do water wells work? Why did medieval people know where to build them or why they provided clean drinking water?",
    "answer": "Have you ever sat by a lake or river and dug a little hole in the ground? After a while, water will collect in the bottom, because the water flows through dirt and stone around the river too. When it rains, a lot of water flows down into the ground and that ground that carries water is called an aquifer. Depending on what kind of dirt and rocks are there and how the hills and mountains are sloped, it will collect in certain places.   Very ancient people needed water to live, just like we do today. They usually chose to live near rivers, lakes, and streams. They also dug little holes in the ground nearby, and noticed the water in those holes was nice and filtered by the dirt and sand. If they dug a hole and covered it up, their water would taste good and stay clear of leaves, sticks, and algae. So they dug deeper and deeper holes, and found they could move further from lakes and rivers which would flood from time to time.   Where to dig a well was trickier the further you got from water though. Sometimes they dug big holes for nothing, and that was disappointing, but they learned a lot from it. Parents taught their children what to look for, what kinds of rocks and plants made for good well ground.  EDIT: WHOA!!! Glad so many people were amused by writing in my teacher-voice!

    "question": "ELI5 If time is a dimension, why can you only go in one direction?",
    "answer": "Ok, so this is far from a fully accepted theory, but it *is* a theory, and based off some very well-accepted theories.   In General Relativity, you don\u2019t really \u201cmove\u201d through time. Instead, you *are* at all points in time.   As an example with lower dimensions so we can understand it intuitively, imagine a pen moving left and right. Then, as time progresses, you move the page downward under the pen, leaving a line on that page.   The left/right position of that line on the paper represents the spacial position of the pen, while the up/down position represents the temporal position of the pen.   If you look at a single horizontal slice of that line, and you move the horizontal slice upwards at a steady rate, you will see what *looks* like a point moving left and right, imitating the path that your pen took.   But you know that the horizontal slice giving the motion of the pen is actually only a slice of the full picture. In fact, the ink of the pen makes a full line. It just *exists* in both time and space. It\u2019s not moving, it\u2019s not going forward or backward, it\u2019s just a line sitting there.   The only way to see motion from this line is by only looking at a single moving slice - a single moment in time - at any given instant.   This is what happens in real life. You are a 4-dimensional, static line through spacetime. The reason you seem to move, think, and be dynamic in any way is because you\u2019re experiencing a single slice of time, a single instant in your \u201cworldline\u201d (that\u2019s the real name for it), and that slice of time you experience is moving forward through time at 1 second per second.   Ok, but here\u2019s where it gets really weird.   How do you know that you\u2019re progressing through time? You\u2019re only ever living in the exact present, it\u2019s not like you have a sense that tells you time is passing, so how do you know it is?  Generally, the response is that you remember all the past instants in time, right? That layer of recent memories tells you you\u2019re moving through time, forming new memories.   But (assuming we accept that memories are due to some arrangement of matter in your brain, and not caused by magic or spirits or whatever), there\u2019s absolutely no way for you to differentiate between actually progressing through time and developing new memories, or just being a static entity that can\u2019t move, or do anything, that\u2019s stuck in a single instant in time, but with memories from all the previous instants.   Essentially, the idea is you aren\u2019t moving through time, you\u2019re stuck in this exact moment, but with the *memories* in your brain telling you that you are moving through time.   So now, the question isn\u2019t \u201cwhy are we only moving in one direction through time\u201d because in fact, you aren\u2019t moving through time at all. You\u2019re just a single static slice of your 4-dimensional worldline with the memories making you *think* you\u2019re moving through time. Rather, the question is \u201cwhy do we only remember the past, and not the future\u201d.   And the general idea for that is because of entropy. Let\u2019s pretend that your brain is a watermelon, and you\u2019re trying to remember a hammer that\u2019s coming to smash that watermelon.   Now, theoretically, it\u2019s within the laws of physics for a smashed watermelon to spontaneously bounce off the ground, join together, and throw a hammer into the air. It\u2019s *possible*, but insanely unlikely, because every one of billions of trillions of particles would have to vibrate in exactly the right way at the right time to accomplish that.   On the other hand, it\u2019s *very* likely for a watermelon hit by a hammer to spontaneously smash. That\u2019s something that increases entropy, and you have common sense to realize that would happen.   So, if we see a smashed watermelon, we can pretty easily conclude, \u201chey, a hammer probably hit this\u201d. If we see an *unsmashed* watermelon though, you can\u2019t conclude \u201cthis watermelon probably solidified from many small chunks of watermelon on the ground and threw a hammer into the air\u201d.   In a way, you can say a smashed watermelon \u201cremembers\u201d into the past that it was hit by a hammer.   On the other hand, a solid watermelon can\u2019t \u201cremember\u201d into the future that it *will be* smashed, because the probability that a solid, unsmashed watermelon corresponds to being hit by a hammer in the future is so vanishingly small.   Your brain is basically that watermelon. It can\u2019t remember into the future because it\u2019s so insanely unlikely that a brain affected by the future would somehow reverse every process required to, for example, erase a memory, send the signal back down the optic nerve, causing your cones to yeet out photons into space.   **TL;DR:** *You don\u2019t move through time at all, you\u2019re stuck in time with memory of the past. You only remember the past and not the future because entropy*",

    "question": "ELI5: Once a lottery like Mega Millions has a high enough jackpot so that the expected value of the ticket is higher than the cost, why does it still feel like it\u2019s a bad investment to buy a ticket?",
    "answer": "Let's simplify things and consider a lottery that just has one big jackpot and no other prizes. Let's say the odds of winning this jackpot are 1 in 300 million (that's roughly the [odds](https://www.megamillions.com/How-to-Play.aspx) for getting all the numbers right to win the Mega Millions jackpot). Instead of drawing a set of numbers, let's say you just roll a 300 million-sided die and you win the jackpot if it comes up '1'. Let's say the jackpot is $1 billion and it costs $2 for each roll of the die.  Your expected winnings per roll are $1 billion / 300 million = $3.33. Clearly, that's more than it costs and so statistically you expect to make a profit. That is, if you could roll the die enough times, your winnings would equal $3.33 per roll, for a profit of $1.33 per roll. For instance, if you were able to play 1 trillion times, you'd almost certainly make a profit close to $1.33 trillion.  The problem, of course, is that you can't afford to play 1 trillion times. You have neither the time nor the upfront cash to finance that. So it doesn't matter how the statistics work out in the long run. The important thing is: is there a reasonable probability that you'll make a return on your investment before either your time or your money runs out?   Clearly, you need to win the jackpot at least once in order to have a chance to make a profit. Note that you're not guaranteed to make a profit once you win - if it takes too many rolls, you'll still be making a loss. But if you don't win even once, you'll certainly make a loss.  So how often do you need to roll the die to win the jackpot at least once? Well, it's never a sure thing that you'll win, but let's say we want to have at least an 80% probability. How often do we need to roll the die for that? The probability that you'll wint the jackpot at least once in N rolls is 1-p^(N) where p is the probability of not winning, i.e. 1-(1/300 million). So we have to solve 1-p^(N) = 0.8, i.e. p^(N) = 0.2. We can solve this by taking the logarithm of 0.2 in base *p*. If none of that makes sense to you, don't worry, just note that this is a mathematical way of answering the question: how many times do I need to roll this die so that I'll have an 80% probability of winning the jackpot at least once?  The answer turns out to be over 482 million times. That's an investment of $964 million, not to mention how much time it takes to roll a die that many times.  And therein lies the rub. You do not have the time nor the money to play the lottery enough times to have any reasonable hope of making a return on your investment. Not to mention, how are you even going to buy that many lottery tickets? They don't stock that many at your local corner store, and I doubt that Mega Millions is going to allow you to purchase that many tickets from them directly.  Also, note that even with 482 million rolls, there's still a 20% chance that you don't win the jackpot, and then you've accumulated losses of almost $1 trillion. To really be sure of a profit, you need to be playing tens of billions of times.  **In short, the problem is that the expected profit comes from a teenie, tiny probability of winning a large amount of money. If you had a 50% probability of winning $6.66 on a ticket that costs $2, the expected profit would also be $1.33 per ticket, only then you'd only have to play like a dozen times in order to be pretty sure of a profit. So it's not about the expected value of the winnings distribution, it's about how uneven it is.**",

    "question": "ELI5: What is bandwidth? (literally)",
    "answer": "> And then you can modulate the wave so it carries data. For digital modulation, that means you vary the amplitude or power level of the transmission.  And/or you can vary the frequency or phase. In FM transmission, you would change your 2400MHz signal up or down by up to 10MHz, and your 'bandwidth' would be just that - your band width, the difference between the lowest and highest frequency you're sending.  Other modulation schemes which use phase and amplitude together are in use too. One example is [QAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation).  If you're transmitting a digital AM signal by pulsing a single carrier frequency on and off, then your bandwidth is the result of a tradeoff based on how fast you're pulsing on and off relative to the frequency of the carrier wave. If you're pulsing a carrier wave on and off very fast, approaching the frequency of the carrier itself, then the spectrum of what you're sending gets quite wide. If you transmit a pure 2400MHz signal at constant level forever, never stopping or starting, then that would be a 0 bandwidth signal, a pure frequency.

    "question": "eli5: is electron and volt produce at the same time ?",
    "answer": "There are two types of charges usually denoted as positive and negative and equal charges repel each other while opposite charges attract each other.  Now electrons are basically the fundamental particles that carry the negative charge and they also happen to be the ones that are moving. Positive charges usually are found with protons in the core of the atoms which usually remain stationary.  Now under normal conditions atoms are not charged because there are as many positively charged particles as there are negatively charged particles. So a charged atom or ion, usually has either too many or too few electrons and thus carries a net charged.  So if it has too many electrons in it's vincinity would like to make it neutral again, because they are attracted to the positive charge whereas if it has too many electrons, then those would like to get away from the other electrons and move to some place with less electrons.  So if you have a copper wire and on one end you put loads of stuff in need of electrons and on the other end you put something with loads of electrons then the electrons in the wire will try to move from one end to the other. So something like this:  \\+1 - 0 - 0 -0 - 0 - (-1)  So +1 is your positive end and (-1) is your negative end and the \"-0-\" are neutral pieces in this chain/wire. So in the next step one electron will move to the open place at the positive end and leave a vacancy at it's previous place:  0 - (+1) - 0 - 0 -0 (-1)  And so the charge travels from one end to the other. As said it's technically the electrons moving to the left, but you can also pretend as if a positive charge is moving to the right. Which engineers determined to be the way to look at it for historical reasons.  So electrons are usually not created in this process they just move from one atom to the next following the slope of charge. And that slope is called a difference in potential and measured in volt. So if you apply a voltage you basically set up such a difference in electrons on those ends and that makes the electrons move. And btw that movement would then be called a current (how many charge passes a given space per second, meassured in ampere).",

    "question": "ELI5: Given the many layers of checks and balances in the court system, how can 1-5% of innocent people end up in prison for crimes they didn\u2019t commit?",
    "answer": "Human error has a lot to do with this, really. Even after taking out all the biases people have in general, such as accusing someone based off their physical appearance, and a lot of circumstantial evidence making a case, you'd still get those wrongful convictions (probably a lot less, but you'd still get them.)  There are two major causes of these.  The first one is the fact that human memory is complete and utter garbage, and can be modified by repetition of alternate facts. This has been proven time and time again, where a police officer repeatedly smashing you with facts about a crime you didn't commit, may lead you to believe you actually did.  This further extends to dubious and faulty memory of events. Many wrongful convictions depend on witnesses misidentifying the culprit, as their brain sees the accused, and if they look close enough to the actual culprit, they will identify them as if they were, because minute differences do not register unless you put the two side by side. Likewise, other details may be super vague, and mis-remembered or misquoted. Often, all you remember is \"the man robbed a bank, and he looked a bit like this\", because your brain needs to remember this for survival reasons, but the rest of the details won't even be remotely in there. This explains the reason why if you are in a similar situation to a crime, you will be also suddenly a bit more anxious, as if the crime was about to happen again. Survival instinct is a fickle thing that hurts all this stuff.  And then, we get to the second major cause: Plea deals. This one is probably the biggest culprit, and it basically goes like this.  You get arrested for (let's say) drug trafficking charges. You know you didn't do it, but somehow, they found a pound of cocaine in your car. While you're struggling with the confusion of \"how the hell did that get there\", and \"who the hell do you know might have left it there for you to be screwed over\", an officer comes in for interrogation, and tries to coax a confession out of you. They say they found the cocaine, they say that through a few contacts, they have witnesses to say you're guilty, and to boot, they found your fingerprints on the cocaine's bag.  After a few hours of back and forth and forth and back of you telling them you wouldn't even know where to get cocaine, and them saying that they have all this evidence, the confession is only a formality at this point, but they still want it, because \"confessing goes a long way in reducing your sentence\", since it means you admit and know that what you did was wrong... Well, they drop in the bomb: If you admit that it is your cocaine, they can drop the charge from drug trafficking, to drug possession, whose sentence is much lighter, so that's sort of meeting halfway. Tired, annoyed, and honestly just wanting to be done with this, you accept the deal, write and sign a confession, and they send you either to the station's cell, or home (often with bail), awaiting the formality that is the trial.  At this point, they have everything they need: They have heavily circumstantial evidence, that is corroborated by you confessing. Suddenly, you get a year in jail for a crime you don't even know how to commit, because honestly, it's better than the alternative of being in jail for drug trafficking... And that's how you got wrongfully convicted.  That kind of scenario happens a lot more often than you probably think, with more and more police officers being caught planting evidence they \"find\" in a car they are ssearching (often illegally) thanks to their body cams. This can also land the same way with murder, but the steps that have to be taken are very different, since there isn't really a step down they usually get you to in order to get there.  Those are the main two culprits of wrongful convictions.",

    "answer": "If I'm not mistaken, you're asking why in an enclosed are like a room, walls aren't always continuous but have columns sticking out. Is that it?  The answer is that, except in special cases, walls do not support anything (but their own weight), but columns do. This is why when you see a building being constructed, you see the frame (beams and columns) being built first, and then walls built later. This is why you sometimes see beams sticking out from the sides of the roof. In this case, we say that walls (called curtain walls) are not an active structural element: they do not contribute to the supporting frame. They're there like curtains: because nobody likes to live in a room with no walls (but they're also helpful in avoiding certain complex loads).  Slabs that make the floor are typically supported by the horizontal beams on the side (and sometimes columns when they're huge). Beams are supported by columns around the corners, and they're sometimes hidden. Columns are supported by the frame from the lower level, and so on..all the way to the foundations.  There are cases when architectural considerations make it difficult to use columns and beams only, so \"supporting walls\" are sometimes added.",

Leaded solder (commonly 63% lead, 37% tin) will melt at 183C while Lead melts at 327C and Tin melts at 232C so that's a big drop.  You can tweak the melting point and some strength parameters by adjusting the mix but there are a few happy points.  A common lead free solder is SAC 305 which is 97% tin, 3% silver, and 0.5% copper, the mix of metals helps give it the right properties  The ideal mixture comes down to how everything interacts to form little metallic crystals  When you solder something its not like glue where there's material A, layer of glue, material B, there's actually an interface layer.  If you're soldering a copper wire to a gold pad there will be gold, layer of gold/tin/other solder bits that transition from pure gold to pure solder, then layer of solder, then tin/copper/solder mix as it bonds to the wire, then just the copper wire.  Its this \"intermetallic\" layer where the solder and the material being connected have created a new alloy that makes the joints strong.

    "answer": "Data can be used to optimize processes and predict behaviour. The former can lead to significant cost-cutting while the latter can increase sales. On top of that, data can reveal far more than people are willing to share or are even aware of.  For example, most shops are franchises. And most franchises are owned by umbrella corporations or multinationals. That means those corporations can collect data on their customers across a wide variety of stores.  Let's say I have a customer discount card for a supermarket, a clothing store and a drug store all owned by the same corporation. There are hundreds of thousands or even millions of people like me who all shop at those same stores.  Those cards let stores track my purchases. And if I start buying diapers regularly, it's reasonable to assume I had a baby recently.  So if you compare my current shopping pattern over the last 9 months to my shopping pattern over the last two years, you can see how my behaviour changed during my pregnancy.  I stopped drinking alcohol. I changed my meals. I started taking different vitamins. I started buying different kinds of clothes. There are countless clues to my shopping behaviour really.  If you collect this data on thousands or even millions of women that you know are pregnant. You can start identify indicators that very accurately predict which customers are pregnant even though they haven't told you.  Now you can change the advertising you serve these customers with to be specifically targeted at pregnancy-related products. This is much more relevant to their interests than untargeted advertising and as such, more likely to be successful.  And this is just the tip of the iceberg really. Big data analysis can very accurately predict a staggering variety of qualities like sexuality, age, gender, political and cultural leanings and so on.  It works so well that it can accurately predict behavioural factors the person themselves isn't even aware of. Ie. a person might think and say they're fairly liberal but their behaviour indicates that they're much more conservative than they think and as such more sensitive to conservative-leaning messages.  Simply put, your personal behavioural data is more honest about you than you're willing to be, even to yourself. And when you can collect data like that on millions, you start to understand people at a level that people don't even understand themselves or each other.

Instead it can be thought of using banks and interest: (For true ELI5, interest means \"the bank will add 'this much' to your money at the specified time)  If we have a bank that generously offers 100% interest every year, and you give them $1, then after a year you will have $2.  But wait! A rival bank wants to offer 50% interest TWICE a year if you bank with them. At first, you may think that 50% twice = 100% once, but that isn't the case. After 6 months with this bank, your total + interest will be $1.50. Then another 6 months later it would be $2.25, getting $0.75 from 50% of the $1.50.  So it would seem that even if the % interest adds to the same 100%, getting it more often leads to giving you more money! So what about a bank that offers 25% interest every 3 months? Or 8.3% every month? How about an inconceivablely small percentage interest at every fraction of a millisecond throughout the year?  You'll find that the final amount tends toward the value of e if you were able to gain interest at a \"natural\" rate of growth.  100% once a year: $2  50% twice a year: $2.25  25% four times a year: $2.4414  8.3% twelve times a year: $2.613035  Every possible moment in a year: $2.71828 (approaching the value of e)  e is also important in Calculus and the natural log, but those are waaaay beyond a 5 year old.",

But the engine can only rev so high, so more gears are needed to go faster. As you go faster the gear ratio changes meaning the engine is turning less times for every rev of the wheel. This creates efficiency at high cruising speeds for better gas mileage. It only takes about 15 horsepower to keep a car going at speed, while it takes many more ponies to get up to that speed.

That's what the cache is for. It provides a much smaller space to store things, but with much faster access (1 to 20 cycles depending on the cache). Cache is part of the CPU chip so is much more expensive than RAM for the same memory, but is much faster to access.  As a result, the CPU stores the currently uses data in the cache to speed up operations. Any time it needs a value not in the cache, it will request its value from the ram, and will keep it in the cache in case it needs it again.  Once the CPU runs out of cache space, it will take the oldest values in the cache (the ones it hasn't accessed for a long time), and will write them back in RAM, making space for other values.  As a result, the more cache you have, the more data you can keep close to your CPU, and the less you have to perform longer RAM access operations.",

    "question": "Eli5: how does credit work?",
    "answer": "You build credit by establishing a history of paying your bills on time.  This can start by simply paying rent or utilities. The longer and more consistently you pay your bills on time the more confident lenders will be in loaning you money.  Paying bills consistently implies that you also have a steady income stream.    Once a sufficient history is established your \"credit\" will make lenders more willing to offer you loans, usually starting with small credit cards (i.e. $300 limit) and/or secured loans (i.e. an auto loan on a car they can repossess if you fail to pay on time). In the beginning you'll still be considered high-risk, so your interest rates and the fees for these will likely be higher, but as you prove your credit worthiness by continuing to make on-time payments on all of your commitments your \"credit\" will improve and they'll offer better terms.    With proof of consistent income along with an expanding history of paying your obligations you can be be approved for more significant secured loans (i.e. a house/condo that can be foreclosed upon if you fail to pay) or unsecured loans (i.e. higher limit credit cards and/or personal loans).    Paying a mortgage on-time is one of the fastest ways to raise your credit worthiness, and with the higher credit rating you'll be able to negotiate lower interest rates and fees, along with higher limits on credit cards.  You may even have lenders pursuing you rather than the other way around.  Failure to pay bills by the due date (or at all) or foreclosure/repossession/bankruptcy can very quickly lower your credit rating.  If you stop paying on an unsecured loan altogether this can also be very detrimental.  As your credit rating drops you can expect that new credit cards and loans will have a higher interest rate, you'll be expected to put down larger down payments and pay higher fees, and possibly be forced to put down deposits (i.e. new apartment, new utility service, new cell phone, etc.).  The cost of your auto insurance can even go up if you have a low credit score.   There are also smaller impacts on your credit score from things such as how frequently you apply for credit (i.e. if you apply for a bunch of credit cards at the same time), how long you've had revolving credit accounts open (the longer the better), etc.",

It's like shards of glass, you can break them and break them, but no matter how much you keep breaking them, they can still cut.   Prions are bits and pieces of mis folded proteins, and they can get tangled up in our healthy proteins and cause them to become mis folded as well. It's hard to break something that is already broken, which is how we normally sterilize and sanitize.   Prion risk can be managed by preventing contamination in same species situations. For instance if you aren't a cannibal, and you don't grow food in fertilizer made from human waste, then the chances of you getting prions in your system is low.   There are some cross species prion diseases but they are rarer than same species infections. This is why it's a bad idea to feed animals feed made with that same animal (not to mention cruel).

    "answer": "It really depends on what type of plane your are talking about and the level of auto pilot that your plane has. But regardless yes it is more difficult than a car:  Controls: Steering is far more like a boat than like car only you have elevation as well. I'm sure other redditors will go into greater detail but your controls are far more complex and if you are relying on the auto pilot you need to understand how to read and program that specific autopilot exactly. You can't learn to fly a Boeing 737-400 and then go fly a Boeing 737-800 - you'd have to go specifically retrain (Boeing 737NG course).  Navigation: In a car you are driving on a road with road markings and road signs and nowadays with extremely an useful GPS lady to guide you along. A huge part of flying is navigating as there's no signs up in the air to guide you along. And with weather conditions you have to learn to navigate by instrumentation alone.  Radio: This is the reason I could never be a pilot - I do not understand what is being said over the radio and you cannot fly safely without having proper communication and radio discipline. You have to be listening closely at **all** times because there's no way to fly safely without listening out for air traffic control constantly.  Safety: If your aircraft experiences any problem in air you can't simple pull over and open the hood. Therefore every single of aspect of flying involves safety checks and doublechecks. And these are not things that you can skip like when you pull your car out in the morning and you don't checked for punctures. You must follow specific checklists each flight in particular order.",

A tour bus needs to have as big an interior as possible to hold all the people while staying within length and weight limits. A big aerodynamic nose ads length that can't be occupied by people. But you can see that modern tour buses try to be aerodynamic within that constraint, especially with front ends that slope towards the top and rounded edges.   Aerodynamics is in part a function of frontal cross section, so buses are already screwed by their very nature. Aerodynamic drag is also a function of length -- all else being equal, the longer object will generally have less drag. Buses are already long, so that helps.   The real killer for tour buses is actually having that big flat rear-end. That creates airflow separation with a huge amount of turbulence, and thus drag. They could make it much more aerodynamic with a Kammback, where the rear is tapered to 50% of the cross section before cutting off, but again, that problem of added useless length.",

When writing a problem out through text (typing on a computer, calculator, any computational device), writing it out as OP has it shown will undoubtedly give an answer as 9.

Writing it out on a piece of paper like  6  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  2(1+2)  will result in 1, because you ALWAYS do the math of the numerators and denominators first as if they were in parentheses.

    "answer": "It\u2019s not bad to take a hot shower during a fever, it\u2019s just uncomfortable. At the same time, taking a cold shower is not recommended because as your skin (periphery) cools down due to cold water, the body tries to compensate by increasing your core (inside) temperature which we don\u2019t want in a patient already suffering from fever. Hence lukewarm water is the best for this situation.  Now there are chemical compounds called pyrogens (molecules that cause fever). Usually the process goes like this : bacteria/virus/microorganisms enter our body, body/immune system detects certain proteins and chemical structures on them (like the cell wall,etc), sends a signal to the brain, brain is like oops need to kill that, need more ammo, so they release some other substances/chemical compounds which further activates the immune system.  Now both the microorganisms and the brain/immune system\u2019s compounds are what we call pyrogens.  So exogenous ( from outside) pyrogens like bacteria give rise to endogenous (from inside the body) pyrogens like the immune system cells which increases the body temperature level just the way you adjust the thermostat to a higher setting.  Hope this helps.

    "answer": "Back in the day, a video game came on physical media and shops would have a limited stock on the day it was released. To ensure you could play it on day 1, you would \"pre-order\" your copy of the game to reserve it at the shop and go collect it on the day.   Knowing how many pre-orders there were helped game companies gauge the sort of popularity the game would have. Lots of useful information for them, and money in the bank.   The downside for consumers was that reviews for the game would come out after people had bought the game, so if it wasn't all that good, it was too late for those buyers unless they went through the hassle of refunding it.    These days, there is no physical disc. Games are bought and installed off of the internet. Steam or PSN or Xbox live have unlimited copies to sell the moment the clock hits 00:00. There is no benefit for the consumer to pre-order. They can buy whenever. There is only the aforementioned downside.

Typically a developer/builder would create a small community of homes, when you bought a property from them you would have to sign a contract agreeing to their terms. For example that you wouldn't paint the house neon orange or start collected rusted out trash cars on your lawn. Remember, they still have other properties to sell and they don't want you to trash your house and prevent them from getting a good deal selling the other homes. Eventually the builder will sell all the properties and the contract you signed gets handed off into a HOA made up of the owners of the various properties.  Eventually, anyone you sell your home to will have to sign the same contract as part of the purchase of the home.

ARM is a reduced instruction set ([RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer)) architecture, while x86 is a complex instruction set ([CSIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer)) architecture. The ELI5 version of that is x86 has way more instructions in its language, and the shape and behavior of those instructions are far more complicated.  For example, x86 instructions are variable-length, meaning the instruction decoder needs to read each byte to determine how many more bytes to read next in order to decode the instruction.  The x86 ISA also has instructions that can manipulate memory directly, while in ARM, you would have to perform all operations on registers before storing those registers back to memory with an appropriate instruction. Technically it's an abstraction, since under the hood, the CPU may well be loading the memory location into a hidden register, performing the requested operation on it, and then store it back to memory, but to you it looks like one instruction.

Some languages don't even have a positional numbering system for example roman numerals I II III IV V etc.  &#x200B;  Base 10 is fairly arbitrary, some argue it happened because we have 10 fingers but there are other bases with other benefits. Computer operations are all done in binary (0 1 10 11) at a base level, a lot of higher level computer science works using hexadecimal numbers (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F).",

That's basically double the median personal income for Americans and that was in addition to what they were already getting for unemployment. That allowed a lot of people to save up, and it caused a lot of people to get used to that new income. In other words, it made people comfortable being dependent.

    "answer": "A subject I have personal experience with!   I broke my humerus playing roller derby a few years back and the fracture severed my radial nerve, meaning I lost the ability to lift my wrist and extend my fingers.   As other posters have noted your nerves are protected by a myelin sheath, which is basically a tube around the actual nerve. If you think about your cell phone charging cable the nerve is like the metal wire inside that carries the electrical current and the myelin sheath is like the materials covering and insulating it.  When a nerve is damaged the entire portion of the nerve from the point of damage to the termination (or \u201cend\u201d) dies as well. As long as the myelin sheath remains intact or heals properly the nerve will begin to regrow from the point of damage to the termination point.   So when performing a transplant or reconstructive surgery all the surgeons can do is connect these tubes and wait for the nerve to regenerate within.   Nerves grow very slowly, about 1 inch per month. The radial nerve which I severed in my accident invenerates the hand muscles at the top of your forearm. There was approximately six inches between this point and the damage site so it took about six months to fully regain control of my hand functions.   As far as I know this only applies to nerves branching off the spinal column. The spinal nerve itself will not regenerate or heal itself in most circumstances, which is why spinal injuries usually result in permanent disabilities.   But long story short, we can\u2019t directly correct the nervous system through surgery or other intervention, we can only manipulate the tubes in which the nerves reside and wait for the nerves to repair themselves.",

They cannot see what's on your screen, unless they put a special tracking app on your phone.  They cannot see which apps you are using, unless - again - they put a special tracking app on your phone.  Apps access the internet in a similar way to browsers. So, if you log in to your bank app, they can only see that you connected to [https://myawesomebank.com](https://myawesomebank.com).  # Explanations  When you tell your browser to show [https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), it first needs to know what server hosts [youtube.com](https://youtube.com). So, it asks a special DNS server \"hey, what's [youtube.com](https://youtube.com)?\" And it'll respond \"It's 172.217.13.238!\" (I assume you know what an IP address is, but if not, it's basically like a home address - where a website lives in the internet.)  This is quite an old process, and in most circumstances is still done without any encryption - which basically means the employer can take a peek at it.  All other messages are sent encrypted (with HTTPS). This is that padlock icon in your browser, and it means that before sending anything, the browser and the server agreed to use a secret code so that noone else can read these messages.  However, some browsers (like Firefox (by the way you should totally switch to it it's really good)) can use DNS-over-HTTPS, which is the same encrypted connection to the DNS server. It's not the same level of security as using a VPN though, as they can still see that you're connecting to [172.217.13.238](https://172.217.13.238) and then do a reverse DNS lookup - that tells them you connected to some Google server, which could be anything.

The engine is not directly hooked to your wheels (if it was, you would peel out of the driveway as soon as you turned it on) Instead, there is a transmission which has a clutch (basically a part that grabs on to the spinning crank) and gears. The gears make it so your wheels don\u2019t have to spin as fast as your engine, but can spin at a slower rate. When you shift up, that\u2019s just going to a new gear which makes your wheels spin closer to your engine speed.

My mother would swear them off as death traps on a highway.  These days though, 4 cylinders are plenty fast enough for highway acceleration and are still way more fuel efficient than a 6.

The speed of the surface doesn't matter, humans can't feel the speed, we only feel the change in speed, which is acceleration. And by rotating once every 24 hours the change in the direction of the speed is very small. Earth also rotates very uniformly and to same direction, so even with faster rotation, it would just feel like the gravity is weaker.  This is called centrifugal force, which can be calculated for the earth:  [https://i.imgur.com/PSXL6K5.png](https://i.imgur.com/PSXL6K5.png)  So if we put a human on the equator and calculate how much the centrifugal force of the rotating earth makes the human lighter, it's about 2 newtons of force, which is about 200 grams lighter on earth's surface.

Lower gears mean that the engine is turning more times (more power) for every time the wheel turns. This gives it the extra oomph to accelerate. But the engine can only rev so high, so more gears are needed to go faster. As you go faster the gear ratio changes meaning the engine is turning less times for every rev of the wheel. This creates efficiency at high cruising speeds for better gas mileage. It only takes about 15 horsepower to keep a car going at speed, while it takes many more ponies to get up to that speed. All that being said, there is a style of transmission known as a continuously variable transmission, which doesn't change gears so much as smoothly changes the ratio as needed while driving, resulting in a smooth acceleration without changing individual gears.",

    "question": "ELI5 If time is a dimension, why can you only go in one direction?",
    "answer": "Ok, so this is far from a fully accepted theory, but it *is* a theory, and based off some very well-accepted theories.   In General Relativity, you don\u2019t really \u201cmove\u201d through time. Instead, you *are* at all points in time.   As an example with lower dimensions so we can understand it intuitively, imagine a pen moving left and right. Then, as time progresses, you move the page downward under the pen, leaving a line on that page.   The left/right position of that line on the paper represents the spacial position of the pen, while the up/down position represents the temporal position of the pen.   If you look at a single horizontal slice of that line, and you move the horizontal slice upwards at a steady rate, you will see what *looks* like a point moving left and right, imitating the path that your pen took.   But you know that the horizontal slice giving the motion of the pen is actually only a slice of the full picture. In fact, the ink of the pen makes a full line. It just *exists* in both time and space. It\u2019s not moving, it\u2019s not going forward or backward, it\u2019s just a line sitting there.   The only way to see motion from this line is by only looking at a single moving slice - a single moment in time - at any given instant.   This is what happens in real life. You are a 4-dimensional, static line through spacetime. The reason you seem to move, think, and be dynamic in any way is because you\u2019re experiencing a single slice of time, a single instant in your \u201cworldline\u201d (that\u2019s the real name for it), and that slice of time you experience is moving forward through time at 1 second per second.   Ok, but here\u2019s where it gets really weird.   How do you know that you\u2019re progressing through time? You\u2019re only ever living in the exact present, it\u2019s not like you have a sense that tells you time is passing, so how do you know it is?  Generally, the response is that you remember all the past instants in time, right? That layer of recent memories tells you you\u2019re moving through time, forming new memories.   But (assuming we accept that memories are due to some arrangement of matter in your brain, and not caused by magic or spirits or whatever), there\u2019s absolutely no way for you to differentiate between actually progressing through time and developing new memories, or just being a static entity that can\u2019t move, or do anything, that\u2019s stuck in a single instant in time, but with memories from all the previous instants.   Essentially, the idea is you aren\u2019t moving through time, you\u2019re stuck in this exact moment, but with the *memories* in your brain telling you that you are moving through time.   So now, the question isn\u2019t \u201cwhy are we only moving in one direction through time\u201d because in fact, you aren\u2019t moving through time at all. You\u2019re just a single static slice of your 4-dimensional worldline with the memories making you *think* you\u2019re moving through time. Rather, the question is \u201cwhy do we only remember the past, and not the future\u201d.   And the general idea for that is because of entropy. Let\u2019s pretend that your brain is a watermelon, and you\u2019re trying to remember a hammer that\u2019s coming to smash that watermelon.   Now, theoretically, it\u2019s within the laws of physics for a smashed watermelon to spontaneously bounce off the ground, join together, and throw a hammer into the air. It\u2019s *possible*, but insanely unlikely, because every one of billions of trillions of particles would have to vibrate in exactly the right way at the right time to accomplish that.   On the other hand, it\u2019s *very* likely for a watermelon hit by a hammer to spontaneously smash. That\u2019s something that increases entropy, and you have common sense to realize that would happen.   So, if we see a smashed watermelon, we can pretty easily conclude, \u201chey, a hammer probably hit this\u201d. If we see an *unsmashed* watermelon though, you can\u2019t conclude \u201cthis watermelon probably solidified from many small chunks of watermelon on the ground and threw a hammer into the air\u201d.   In a way, you can say a smashed watermelon \u201cremembers\u201d into the past that it was hit by a hammer.   On the other hand, a solid watermelon can\u2019t \u201cremember\u201d into the future that it *will be* smashed, because the probability that a solid, unsmashed watermelon corresponds to being hit by a hammer in the future is so vanishingly small.   Your brain is basically that watermelon. It can\u2019t remember into the future because it\u2019s so insanely unlikely that a brain affected by the future would somehow reverse every process required to, for example, erase a memory, send the signal back down the optic nerve, causing your cones to yeet out photons into space.   **TL;DR:** *You don\u2019t move through time at all, you\u2019re stuck in time with memory of the past. You only remember the past and not the future because entropy*",

Raindrops fall fairly slowly - the very largest raindrops fall at [about 10 m/s or a little over 20 mph](https://gpm.nasa.gov/resources/faq/how-fast-do-raindrops-fall). That means that if you're going at highway speeds (say, 30 m/s), the tilt of the rain is very sharp. Relative to your car, the rain is traveling at an angle only about 18 degrees above horizontal (for those of you who are interested in the math, this is arctan(10/30)) at most. So the situation [looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/068FWWX.png) from the car's moving perspective.  From a stationary perspective, the car is moving fast enough that a drop that would hit the back window would have to have been *inside* the car a moment earlier - which obviously it could not have been.",

    "question": "eli5: What does a Business Analyst do?",
    "answer": "So, programmers know how to write code and build systems, but they're not experts in the business \"domain\" that they work in.  For example, I'm a programmer who works in the insurance industry. I've worked in it for over 15 years and I understand a lot about how insurance and insurance systems work, but every different insurance company I work for has a different way of running their business.  So, the business know how their business runs, but don't know how to build/program systems, and I know how to build/program systems, but don't fully understand the business.  This is where a Business Analyst (BA) comes in. It's their job to understand how the business works, and help extract the requirements that the business needs for their IT system. The BA then helps 'translate' those requirements into a form (usually called use cases or user stories) that programmers can understand in order to implement. BA's can also help testers define their test cases around the same use cases/user stories so that the features can be properly tested to ensure they meet the business' requirements.  That's only part of a BA's role, they can also do work to analyse and improve business processes, help with documentation and various other tasks, but this is the main interaction with IT/programmers that I think you're looking for.  TL;DR - BA's act as a 'translator' between the business and programmers in order to define and validate requirements.",

    "answer": "Inequity is not a new problem, and it's not something that's suddenly started getting much worse.  While people like to compare Jeff Bezos' fortune to the average Amazon worker's salary and say \"inequality as never before\", that's not true.  It you compare the wealth of a 16th century french king to a 16th century peasant, the inequality was much worse in the 16th century.  Since the era of the pyramids (5000 years ago) it's been important for the people on the \"got a lot\" side of inequality to offer some justification for why they have so much more than everybody else.  Religion was invented for this purpose.  Kings were \"God on Earth\", or had \"Divine Right to Rule\".  The purpose of churches was to make the \"not got a lot\" people happy with the situation, and they often did that by promising them a better life in the future (aka after they died).  Religion has done its job for those thousands of years, so it's kept around.  While 25% of people in the US have no chosen religion, and that number is rising, everybody running for President is in favor of a religion.

From the FAQ for the study I am in:  >**How can this test tell the difference between antibodies produced from infection and antibodies produced from vaccination?**   When a person is infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, their body makes antibodies in response to several viral proteins, including nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein. The vaccines currently approved for use in the UK only trigger antibodies against spike (S) protein.   The lateral flow devices (LFDs) that we used in the self-test antibody study detected antibodies to the spike protein so we were unable to tell if the antibodies were due to infection or to the vaccine (which is why you have been asked to provide this blood sample).   The laboratory test being used in this follow-up study detects antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein which are only produced following infection, so a positive test result will tell us that you have previously been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.",

    "answer": "When a nuclear weapon goes off it releases a huge amount of UV/Xrays/Gamma rays which move outward and smack into electrons of air molecules with enough energy to knock them loose and send the electrons flying.  This huge and sudden current of electrons quickly moving away from the center point creates a suddenly changing magnetic field.  We use this feature in transformers and wireless chargers.  If you change a current it creates a changing magnetic field which can be coupled into a nearby wire to create a current in that wire so you can pass power wirelessly.  For nuclear EMPs \"nearby\" is hundreds of miles away and the changing magnetic field is insanely strong.  The US did a test called [Starfish Prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_Prime) where they detonated a nuke about 400 km up(roughly the height of the space station which didn't exist yet).     Starfish Prime ended up creating a field over Hawaii (900 miles away) that was 5600 Volts/meter which means a 10 meter long power line would generate 56,000 volts at the end of it.  This is pretty bad for power lines and blew out a few hundred streetlights, but it was really before the era of microelectronics.  A 5mm long trace in your smart phone would have experienced 28 volts which is pretty devastating to a system expecting to run at less than 5 volts.

    "answer": "There is quite the large misconception about \"lack of oxygen\" and \"temperature\" when it comes to climbing Mt. Everest, in that the real technical problem with it is actually the air pressure.  If you've ever been in an airplane, or a fast elevator, you probably experienced a stark change to how your ears hear stuff while either going up or down (a lot less prominent ***while*** flying, but as it happened to me at least twice, I'm not gonna knock it out either). That's the atmospheric pressure affecting your body, which causes a plethora of changes. Eardrums \"popping\" is one of the least bad while climbing the big mountain, and you go up so slowly that you might not even have that one at all, but...  The human body is meant to survive at around 1 atm (read: \"atmosphere\", which is the average Earth's air pressure at sea level, assuming a temperature of 15\u00b0C/59\u00b0F.) A great example of something that can happen if you lower the pressure outside, is that the force that contains your tissues and cells together is now fighting against less force to contain it, which may cause them to swell, and create a plethora of ***really bad symptoms***, such as headaches, nausea, dizziness, shortness of breath (made worse for it being harder to breathe in the same amount of oxygen), and with longer exposure, can lead to cough, vomiting and confusion.  This is called, colloquially, as \"Mountain Sickness\" or \"Altitude Sickness\", and is one of the first big warnings when you get serious about climbing Mt. Everest, basically is the main misconception about the lack of oxygen up there, and why while it does help in some cases, it's not just a matter of bringing an oxygen tank and calling it a day.  Now, for the temperature issue: Yes, it's cold up there. It definitely is. But the problem with stating that as a factoid is also quite problematic, since technically, the air being less dense means you'll lose less body heat to the ambient air. That's the good news.  The bad news is, however, that you'll lose more of it to the snowy ground, and since your tissues tend to be swollen, you will also face an increased bloodflow, your heat-sensitive blood is now more likely to be exposed to the air, which paradoxically makes ot easier for you to lose heat in the thinner atmosphere... So, I guess my line about losing less heat to the ambient air was a bit misleading.  Also worth noting: Your sweat will be doing a much poorer job at regulating our body temperature, since liquids boil (and thus evaporate) at a lower temperature point when at lower pressure/higher altitude...  Now, I sure that at least one detail I've said here may have been debunked in some way, but that's how I was explained it in high school.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why do we stutter even though we know exactly what we want to say?",
    "answer": "It's not my specialist subject at all, but I've read a couple of articles on the subject.  To make words come out of your mouth, there is a part of your brain that takes the \"words you want to say\" messages and controls the parts of your mouth, tongue, breathing and stuff to make the desired sounds come out of your mouth.  There is another part of the brain that deals with hearing and understanding.  That part of the brain takes sounds coming in your ears and identifies word sounds and constructs meaning out of them.  When you actually want to speak, both of these processes are working together.  In your brain you form the sequence of words you want to say, and send them to the \"make words come out of your mouth\" process.  At the same time the \"understanding language\" part of your brain is listening to the actual sounds coming out of your mouth and checking that the sounds it is hearing are a correct representation of what you wanted to say.  If it detects something going wrong, it interrupts the making words process and makes you go back a bit and do it again, but right this time.  For people who stammer, there is a mismatch in this process.  The \"detect a mistake and correct it\" process happens when it doesn't need to happen, and causes a stutter.  Of course once the first stutter happens, there is now a genuine mistake, so the process repeats, and you get caught in a loop of trying to correct the error caused by trying to correct the previous error.  It is well known that people who are prone to stuttering and stammering only do it in certain situations, for example if they are nervous or in certain emotional states, because in those situations, there is a different threshold for error tolerance.  If you are comfortable and with people you trust, your brain just doesn't care as much if it makes a bit of a mistake.  If you can't hear yourself speak, then you can't stammer because it breaks the feedback loop.  If you are singing, then a different process is taking place.  The brain deals with music and language separately.  If you listen to a song, for example, it is very often the case that you just don't follow the meaning of the lyrics because your brain is in \"music\" mode rather than \"language\" mode.  When you sing, the sound feedback is being handled by the music part of the brain, so the hypercorrection from the language part of the brain doesn't cause the undesirable interruptions.",

Mass is a property that particles can have, its a way for energy to be stored but not the only way and not all particles have mass.  Most things you deal with are large and are made up of massive quantities of particles which all have mass so most stuff you think of has mass, but the light from the sun doesn't have mass but it can still push things because a photon's energy is in its momentum (not mass*velocity but a more intrinsic momentum).  You'll often see E=mc^2 (energy = mass * speed of light^2) but the full equation is E^2 = p^(2)c^(2)+m^(2)c^(4) where p is momentum.  Photons have momentum but not rest mass which forces them to travel at the speed of light, nothing with mass can reach the speed of light without infinite energy and nothing without mass can travel at any other speed.  Basically the universe has a set of fields that things interact with.  The electromagnetic field interacts with charge and magnetism, its force is carried by photons.  The Higgs field is what gives things mass, its force is carried by the Higgs boson.  Photons happen to not interact with the Higgs field and therefore don't have mass, while quarks and electrons and neutrinos all do interact with the Higgs field and therefore have mass.

    "answer": "Ever played Pandemic? The way you win Pandemic is to be *highly* infectious but very low lethality. Then, once the entire world is infected, you buy heart failure.   Reality doesn't work like that - the same mutation doesn't arise simultaneously in all instances of the virus - but the important part, that high infectivity, low lethality viruses are S tier, is true. High infectivity and low lethality allows the virus to propagate and multiply. The more people are infected, the more copies of the virus there are. The more copies of the virus there are, the more opportunities the virus has to develop new mutations.   Omicron will already have mutated a bunch of times. Most of those mutations won't change anything. Some of them will make it less effective. Some of them will make it more infective. Some of them will make it more deadly, meaning it's both high infectivity and high lethality. When that happens (and it is a when, not an if), it'll become the next major variant and it could potentially be worse than the first wave. Basically, the fewer people infected, the less likely new mutations are to emerge. A strain that can infect a lot of people is bad because of the future mutation potential.  There's also a matter of simple maths. Imagine that Delta Covid infects 10,000 people per day and hospitalises 1% of infected. That's 100 new admissions to hospitals per day. Now imagine Omicron has half the hospitalisation rate of Delta, but has three times the infectivity. Omicron infects 30,000 people per day, and hospitalises 0.5% of them. That's 150 new admissions per day. That's worse overall even though Omicron is less lethal individually, because it's infecting so many more people.",

Judicial decrees include things like arrest warrants, bail terms, that sort of stuff. This means they hunt fugitives, which is probably where most of their video game involvement comes from.  Marshalls don't generally investigate the way that cops or the FBI do. A judicial decree is something given to a specific person, so there's no whodunit to solve.

    "answer": "This hopefully counts as eli5 answer: gradients tell you how fast a thing changes. So you need two inputs: what is the thing you're looking at, and what's the knob you turn to make the thing change. Usually the first input is a number, or numbers, say, the temperatures of every key on your keyboard. There are typically two knobs to turn: the time knob or the \"space\" knob. They just return different gradients. The time knob will take only one key of the keyboard as input and will tell you how fast the current temperature of that key changes over time. Use another key as input, and you get the current change of temperature. This is a gradient over time, it will tell you how the input temperature changes at one point on the keyboard.  The other knob is the spatial knob. It takes as input the key again, but it will tell you how the temperature changes as you move from this key down, or left. So while the first gradient is change in temperature per minute, the second is change in temperature per inch. As such, a gradient can be used as prediction. If you know the current temperature of a key and the time-gradient, you can calculate roughly how warm the key will be in 3 minutes. And likely: if you know the spacial gradient, you can estimate how warm the key on the left is.  Edit: using time and space knobs are the most common  gradients. But there are more knobs, generally anything that has an influence on your input can be used as knob: everything else returns a very boring gradient that is 0 everywhere, no matter how much you turn that knob, your input doesn't change.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why are polypeptides sensitive across narrow ranges of temperature/pH?",
    "answer": "Polypeptides get their function once they're \"folded\" into their shape. This folding is so sensitive that even extremely small changes, like a slight change in an amino acid's orientation, can drastically affect how good the protein is at its job, like catalyzing reactions or forming cellular structures. On a basic level, the shape they take on is a function of two main things, how it interacts with itself and how it interacts with its environment. Any changes to either of those will give you a slightly differently folded protein and likely affect its function. As a result, polypeptides are usually extremely optimized for the environment they're going to exist in, and why our bodies work so hard to maintain a consistent environment within itself.  pH is the probably the easiest to understand. One thing to remember is that pH is logarithmic, meaning even small changes in the pH value means orders of magnitude of change in the environment of the polypeptide. As nearly half of the amino acids that make up all of our proteins have some kind of pH sensitive portion of their molecules, any fluctuations in the pH of their environment will cause them to become \"more charged\" or \"less charged\", which will affect both how the peptide as a whole interacts with itself and its environment. This will in turn affect its folding (and in some cases, also affect chemical reactions it can carry out, as some of these rely on certain amino acids being protonated/deprotonated to work).   As for temperature, you're affecting both how the polypeptide interacts with itself and with its environment simultaneously by basically giving the system more energy. A lot of protein folding is based on molecular interactions like hydrogen bonding, which are sensitive to the temperature of the system. Too much energy in the system and the desired attractive forces can kind of get \"overwhelmed\", while if it's too cold, new undesired interactions can start dominating. The end result is the same, a change in the protein folding which affects its function.  Hope that helps!

At first, they were arbitrary, then people bumped into problems. Like, the foot - presume our feet are different lengths... I can go even earlier with the cubit, supposedly the length from your elbow to your finger tip. Can you see a problem here?  So the second was first a division of a day. Then it was a fraction of a solar day. Then it was defined by a fraction of a year, because our orbit around the sun is more stable than our rotation about our axis. A lot changed starting in the 1940s with the quartz clock.  But the thing is, we had, for a long, long time, a pretty much agreed upon definition for what a second was, if not imperfect. So if you're going to invent an atomic clock, or any device that is really, really accurate at counting divisions of time, then you're going to want to fit it to peoples expectations. They back-fit the definition to what was approximately a second, since a second prior was always approximate anyway.  But it's really hard to define a \"base\" unit of time. What is the smallest unit of time that there can be? The smallest unit of time that can be measured? We don't actually know.

Companies that make things like TVs decide what to sell the TVs for. They want that price to be higher than the cost of the stuff they bought to make it. They also pay attention to what their competitors are charging and want their price to be below their competitors', unless they think they have a better offering.   If the company wants to make more money, or if they think the costs of making the TV are going to go up, they raise their price. If it's true the costs of their materials went up, it's likely their competitors' prices are going up too. If their competitors see their prices go up even when materials aren't going up, their competitors might raise their prices to match. Or, if the store that sells the TVs wants more money, they might raise the price they sell the TVs for so they make a little more profit.   The only way to truly stop inflation is for the government to set the price for *everything*, but that creates a lot of other economic problems. Instead, we prefer for the government to take indirect actions like changing the interest rate at which banks can borrow money from the government.

    "answer": "There would be no way to route traffic efficiently without IP addressing.  The only way it's done efficiently is by knowing based on network address where to route your traffic.  Think of it more like sending something in the mail, vs a phone book.  You need multiple pieces of information to get it to the right place right?  You need Zip Code (US), State, City, Street Address, and Person.  You mail that piece of mail from one side of the US to another, the first thing they do is look at that information to determine how it's going to get to it's destination.  You can't just put a name on there, as there is no way for the mail service to know that name out of the 300 million people living in the US.  So they start with ZIP code (which is really smaller than state), then narrow it down by street address, then eventually when it gets into your mailbox your wife hands you the mail because it ends up with your name on it.  Same way IPs work.  The numbers are not just randomly assigned.  Network address space is reserved by classes.  And routing tables know where those addresses are assigned to.  We know that everything 8.x.x.x is going somewhere, and everything that 9.x.x.x is going somewhere.  Then, as it gets closer to the destination, we use the additional digits to pinpoint where it's going until we get to the last digit and then we have the server.  Also, its VERY important to know, that name does not equal 1 server or IP address.  For example, when you go to [google.com](https://google.com) you go to 10000s of servers, not just a single server with a single IP address.  Also, for smaller setups, 1 server can house multiple IP addresses.  I have 5 domain names hosted on a single IP address.  That's why you can't just go to a name.  Really the name gets resolved to an address (or one in a pool of addresses), and then when you hit that server your browser says \"Hey, I'm trying to get to [myfavoritedomain.com](https://myfavoritedomain.com)\" and the web server serves it up.",

    "answer": "Much of the problem here is that you\u2019ve loaded the question, haven\u2019t used proper, consistent quantifications, and have flawed logic.   It\u2019s not strictly true that hamsters won\u2019t willingly climb into hamster balls. It\u2019s not clear whether they can ever learn that an open hamster ball with a treat inside will lead to confinement in the ball.  It seems unlikely they recognize the risks. It\u2019s not difficult to find YouTube videos of a hamster going into a hamster ball willingly.   Hamster balls and exercise wheels aren\u2019t the same. A conclusion about a hamster ball doesn\u2019t necessarily also apply to exercise wheels.   You went from \u201cmost exercise wheels\u201d (quantified) to \u201cman-made exercise wheels\u201d (unquantified). Which is it?  Most? All? Many? Some? A few?  Finally, you\u2019ve ignored the obvious data. Hamsters, and other rodents, freely use exercise wheels in preference to running around their enclosures (though they do wander through their enclosures), though IIRC, they\u2019re much less likely to use a wheel if their enclosure is very large. They can\u2019t naturally get the distance from a typical enclosure that they get from their wheels.   The reality is that most people aren\u2019t going to have enclosures with enough space so that hamsters won\u2019t feel the need to use the wheel. So as long as the exercise wheel doesn\u2019t have dangerous problems, why shouldn\u2019t it be encouraged?

    "answer": "Beekeeper checking in - queens are produced from the same egg as workers.  The egg selected to be a future queen is fed more royal jelly which changes her physiology when she is developing.  Once born, she will battle any other queens to the death.  She then matures for about a week, then flies off for mating.  She typically mates with 15-25 drones.  After returning to the hive she will start laying eggs within a week or so.  At here peak she will lay approx 1,500 eggs per day.    Workers are all female, but do not typically lay eggs.  They have different types of roles in the hive based on age. In rare instances they will lay eggs, but since they never mated, the eggs are all male.  Drones are males with no father, but a grandfather.  They do no work to improve the hive.  Their only function is to spread the genetics of the hive.  They are driven put of the hive in the late fall since they have no value at that point.  Honey is nectar that is collected, concentrated and processed with enzymes.  A forager bee brings the honey into the hive and passes it to another worker.  They then store it into a comb.  During this time enzymes in the bee start processing the honey.  Once stored the comb is left open until the concentration of water drops to around 17% and then it is capped.  Workers live about 6 weeks, unless it is winter and they can live up to 4 months in the hive.  Queens live 2-4 years assuming they are not killed by another queen.",

If I give you another point and say that I'm a certain distance away from *that* point as well, you can narrow down where I could be based on the intersection of the two circles.  A third point/distance pair is sufficient to get a single approximate location, and further pairs refine the location further, as well as providing redundancy in case of signal loss.

    "answer": "Feedback can happen at any frequency that's a multiple of the one that matches the time taken for the sound to go from the microphone, through the amplifier etc. come out of the speaker, and reach the microphone again.  If the speaker and microphone are a metre apart (say, between your monitor and a headset mic) then that \"fundamental\" frequency would be 330Hz (sound travels at about 330 metres per second in air) which sounds like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX8KZx5RDg8)  This isn't all that high pitched, but that's where *harmonics* come in!  Any sound at a frequency that's a simple multiple of the main harmonic (e.g. 2x330=660Hz, 3x330=990Hz etc.) will *also* be repeated.  Most usually, the sound that triggers this kind of feedback is a fairly sharp click noise, such as you get when you plug something in. These sounds have *lots* of high frequency components, and any of these that are a multiple of the fundamental will join in the feedback party.  Why do we only hear the high frequencies? Because there are only a couple of \"low\" frequencies that are multiples of that fundamental, and far more at higher frequencies.  Human hearing spans around 20Hz-20KHz, so the feedback would likely include 330, 660, 990, all the way up to 19,800Hz (maybe higher depending on your hearing)  That's a total of around 60 different frequencies, and only the first few would sound \"low\" - the highest ones would be fairly painful to hear at any volume.",

While simple, it does possess an infinite storage device which real-world computers obviously can't; Turing Completeness doesn't say anything about the size of computations that a computer is capable of solving, or about its speed.  So, ignoring real-world limitations like speed and storage capacity, all Turing Complete computers can solve the same set of problems.

If something can do all three of those things, then they technically have enough power to do anything any other computer can. Whether it can do it at the same speed or not, well, Turing completeness makes no promises about speed.  An analogy to Turing completeness would be like if there was something called \"math complete\", which checked if a language could do all mathematical operations.  If there was a language that could perform addition on any number, then it would be \"math complete\". Why? Because it can simulate subtraction by changing the second number to negative (e.g. it can do 8 - 5 by performing 8 + -5). It can simulate multiplication by adding repeatedly (e.g. it can do 2 * 3 by performing 2 + 2 + 2). It can simulate division by counting how many times it needs to add to reach a number (e.g. it can do 6 \u00f7 2 by performing 2 + 2 + 2 and observing that it takes three 2s to make 6).  A language that can only do addition is slower and longer than a language that can do all mathematical operations, but it can still get the answer at the end of the day.  Likewise, something that is Turing-complete can compute anything any other Turing-complete computer can calculate. It may be slower and its instructions may be much longer and much more complicated, but there will be an equivalent way to write instructions for it to perform the same calculation another computer can do.",

You can rearrange the individual cards very freely without damaging your ability to say \"Yes, that's a shuffled pack of cards.\"  Another way to think of entropy is the ability to pull useful work out of a system. For example, you need a temperature difference to do any work with a heat engine; if there's no gradient, nothing's going to want to move from point A to point B.

However, if you say \"I'm going to kill you\" then include a date, time, how you plan on doing it, etc then it becomes illegal.  Similarly, the argument for freedom of speech cannot be used to defend illegal market manipulation, fraud, insider trading, etc. It is the action that is illegal not the words. Market manipulation is illegal because only a few can benefit from it. In your example Warren Buffet says \"you should buy company X's stock\" so a bunch of people buy it and increase the stock value and then Warren could pull all of his money out and make a ton of money but plummeting the stock price. That would effectively be stealing from the company and the people he told to buy the stock.  Pump and dump like that is very different than typical stock increases because it is not based on an intrinsic value. It is only increasing in value due to a perceived demand based on stock sales but has no relevance to the performance of the company.

    "answer": "Thats how the vast majority if people use the washroom.   Washroom habits tend to be very taboo, which leads to small pockets of odd behavior that some people think is completely normal. The trend I've noticed is that people have their habits and routines and it never occurs to them that people do things differently.   One such example is a subgroup who strip naked to have a poop. People who keep their clothes on (most people) don't usually know the nude poopers exist. The disrobed dookie group can't imagine why one wouldn't have their shirt and socks folded up in the corner while doing business.  You've discovered today that you are in one of those outlying groups. Congratulations, you do something differently than most other people.",

    "answer": "Yes and no.  If we used the same things and never stopped supporting older resources, then yes theoretically we would have to continuously build these devices that remotely store data.  But as technology advances, we are able to store more and more bits of information on smaller devices freeing up resources and power, and we decomission and recycle the older and bulkier things.  Think back to floppy disks. Not that big, but you would need about 3 or 4 thousand floppy disks worth of information to install a windows 10 operating system to a current computer, because each floppy disk was capable of only several kilobytes or megabytes of info. Now we can do it in minutes with a terabyte sized thumb drive.

    "question": "ELI5: what needs to happen before we can unmask safely?",
    "answer": "There are two answers. Neither of them very clear. One personally, and two society-wise. Both depend on risk. The first to your self , the second as a group.   Your risk is based on how likely you are to actually cross paths with someone infectious and how likely that is to cause you serious harm. So are you in an at risk group and where are you are considerations.   The second - how likely you are to be part of a chain of infection, how at risk are the people around you and how well society - such as the health service is coping.   Masks not perfect and life always holds a risk. In the West we have never masked up for flu which kills thousands of people a year - around 20,000 in the U.K. annually I think - though we vaccinate the at risk. Possibly COVId may have some nasty long term consequences even if you dint get seriously ill. But if the consequences of COVID dropped to equivalent to flu , then it would hardly be unreasonable to behave in a similar way. I say that nit to suggest we wait till then ( if it ever happened) but as a comparative starting point. No one can really say at what precise point in infections and consequences between that \u2018flu\u2019 point and the worst of COVID is the point at which we are \u2018safe\u2019.   I expect government ps will come up with a balance of infection rates, hospitalisations and economics with a dose of politics.   Bear in mind that in the East people regularly wear masks on public transport so as either not to do catch viruses or not to spread them , I guess it\u2019s just considered normal hygiene even for colds.   That\u2019s a long winded way of saying that presuming you are not mandated by the governments and pretty much everyone has had access to a vaccine you will have to decide whether you feel either at risk yourself, or feel that you need to still protect other people.

You can use more rational training methods, and teach a mustang to accept a rider (so, \"break\" it) without it ever bucking or objecting.    In the USA we don't have any \"wild\" horses per se.  Our mustangs were all descended from domesticated horses.  So they're more like \"feral\" than truly \"wild\" and they actually train into some really good, alert, intelligent partner horses. (They're like comparing street-born stray dogs to house dogs.  Same genetics, different life experiences.)   Truly \"wild\" horses like from the plains of central Asia are not descended from domesticated horses though.  Their instincts are not the instincts of domesticated animals.

    "answer": "Let me try and explain the European club football pyramid:  First, the most important point: All professional football teams in Europe play under the same umbrella, that is called UEFA. UEFA runs the highest club competition in Europe, called the UEFA Champions League, whose winner is the European champion. The teams that will play in any given year's Champions League are the previous year's winners of the national leagues of European nations.  Oh, yes, the national leagues: Parallel to the Champions League, every nation also has its own leagues. England has its own, called the Premier League, my country Turkey has the S\u00fcper Lig, etc. The qualification process varies by country depending on that country's teams' previous performance, but by winning the national league, any team in any given European country could go and get to play in the Champions League, and win it and become the European champions if they are good enough.  Each nation has lower divisions of their leagues too, but those divisions are all interconnected with the top division. At the end of each season, the top teams in lower divisions switch places with the bottom teams in the higher division, a process known as 'promotion and relegation'. This ensures that, if I and a bunch of my friends decided to form a team in our Turkish town tomorrow, after enough victories in the following years, we could theoretically get promoted to the Turkish S\u00fcper Lig, win that, go to the Champions League, win that, and become the European champions. Improbable, sure, but theoretically not impossible. By winning enough games for a long enough time, any team could win the Champions League.  Every other continent also has a similar system to determine their continental champion. Every year, the winners from all 6 continents play in the  FIFA Club World Cup. The winner is crowned the world champion.  Now these 12 rich teams owned by bastards have decided to bypass this whole system by creating their own league in place of the Champions League. They seem to like the American system of 'closed league', where the owners of teams decide who gets to play, where even after years of horrendous performance you just continue to be part of the competition, where new teams (which are referred to as 'franchises', ugh) have to ask for permission from the league to be part of it.  This would make the entirety of European leagues pointless. Sure, the national leagues would continue to exist, but with no way of joining this 'Super League' besides invitation, and no way for the 'founding clubs' to ever not qualify for it, pretty much all the excitement of European football is being stolen.",

Sometimes it can be caused by head/neck muscles strains.     more ELI5 : **some brain vessels dilated => trigeminal nerve sends information to brainstem that we have some \"brain\" pain => pain**  In migraine, it's usually the same pathway BUT this cranial nerve (trigeminal) is in a \"panic mode\". It reacts so much to this input, that he releases special chemicals (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), P substance etc) that exacerbate blood vessels dilation and cause more inflammation which AGAIN amplifies the vasodilation, leakage of blood vessels, and degranulation of mast cells (immune response) and the sensory input receives this information and makes MORE substances to evoke a more stronger response.  more ELI5: **some brain vessels dilated => trigeminal nerve makes substances that trigger immune response/more vasodilation AND sends information to brainstem that we have some serious \"brain\" pain => big pain => trigeminal nerve makes MORE substances in response to that brainstem response => MORE and WORSE pain.**    And in migraine this cycle can be triggered by diffent stimuli (coffee, low glucose, light, tiredness, lack of sleep etc)   But still the EXACT mechanisms of these condition are not well understood.",

    "question": "ELI5: What is Cyclic Voltammetry and what does it aim to do?",
    "answer": "It's been a long time since I've done this so forgive me any errors or omissions.  You have some substance in a solution. Then you stick electrodes into it and apply voltage to it. You slowly increase the voltage to some set amount over time, then once you get to the max you slowly decrease it back down. The whole time you're measuring how much current flows, which in turn tells you about how much resistance the solution you're analyzing has at each level of voltage. This is generally done by some computerized set up or machine that controls the voltage and measures the current/resistance and plots it on a graph [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_voltammetry#/media/File:Cyclovoltammogram.jpg). It's also generally done several times in a row. So you might go from 0V to 12V (or -9V to 9V or whatever) then back to 0V then back to 12V for several repetitions. This is where the word \"cyclic\" in the name comes from.  So what's the point? Well we're measuring the electrochemical properties of whatever's in the solution. If you get nice smooth line instead of something like that picture I linked above, there's not much interesting going on chemically, it only really tells you about what the electrical resistance of the solution is. In that picture I linked, the substance is undergoing some kind of chemical reaction as the voltage goes up and down, specifically an oxidation-reduction reaction. Those two humps (one hump is oxidation, the other is reduction) going up and down tell you what at what voltage the reaction occurs. The size of the humps (peak current) tells you a bunch of stuff about the reaction that I can't exactly remember at the moment.  There's a number of other things you can measure with this technique (and I'm surely forgetting most of them). One of the interesting ones though is that you can keep running the experiment for a long time having it constantly sweep back and forth. Then you can count how many sweeps it takes until the humps in the graph diminish in size by some appreaciable amount. This gives an idea of how many times the substance your measuring can react back and forth (this is a reversible reaction after all, though if you only get one sweep it means the reaction is not reversible). So, for example, you might be testing some material you want to use for a battery. This measurement gives an idea about how many times that battery could recharge.",

Subscriptions are a way to make people think they are spending less than they are, and for them to never even know how much they are spending. It exploits ego and ignorance and often emotions.  The super simple answer is because they know they can get more money for the same thing because people look at a monthly price as the total cost even if they understand it isn't.

So to answer your last question, any time you're using OpenID Connect, you are, in a sense, using both Oauth and OpenID Connect at the same time   The specifics of the different protocols is beyond ELI5, but broadly speaking, Oauth is useful for authorization while OpenID Connect is useful for authentication. Authorization is the practice of determining whether someone is allowed to do something (e.g. checking the permissions on a file before a user opens it is authorization). Authentication is the practice of determining that someone is who they say they are (e.g. asking for a password is authentication).  Oauth revolves around the \"access token\". An access token indicates that the bearer has access to certain resources or scopes. It performs authorization, but not authentication. How do we know that this access token is coming from a certain user, and not, for example, an app that the user granted access to? We don't! And that's by design in Oauth.  OpenID Connect introduces the \"ID token\", which the Authorization Server (now called the \"Identity Provider\" in OpenID Connect terms) passes to the client alongside the access token. This ID token contains basic user information, like their name or email address as well as a creation and expiration time. It performs authentication, but not authorization. Having an ID token indicates that a particular person is logged in at a particular time. But how do we know what that user has permission to do? We don't!

    "answer": "We have laser engravers at my place of work, engraving and cutting out articles from sheet acrylic.  Yes, it can be more efficient to have the laser engraver begin at one corner of the sheet and work its way over to the other corner. Sometimes the drawing file (we make ours up in Corel Draw) can be optimized to encourage this. Sometimes, no matter what order you put the elements into the file, the laser engraver will etch one part of the sheet sooner than the part of the sheet you intended. Getting the file to \u201cdraw\u201d as quickly as possible involves some trial and error.  We also divide our drawings into three different color layers, which will be processed in this order: red, green, blue.  Red: anything that needs to be *rastered* will be in the red layer. The \u201cprint head\u201d of the laser engraver will zip back-and-forth rapidly firing the laser beam intermittently at low power to draw a bit of artwork, such as a company logo, on the plastic. The effect is like watching a black-and-white television picture being built up line-by-line.  Green: any thing that needs to be *vectored* is in this layer. Straight and curved lines are best drawn by keeping the laser beam on, but at low power, for the duration of each line being drawn. The \u201cprint head\u201d of the engraver will proceed in a smooth motion, along both the X and Y axes as needed to engrave each line.  Blue: all lines to be cut entirely through the acrylic sheet are in the blue layer. Moving the \u201cprint head\u201d around works just as it does in the green layer: smooth motions in both the X and Y axes as needed. But this time, the laser is firing a continuous beam for each cut that is at or nearly at full power. An air assist (either compressed air supplied by the building\u2019s compressor, or the laser engraver\u2019s built-in compressor) will be blowing continually to discourage a fire.

    "answer": "Ever played Pandemic? The way you win Pandemic is to be *highly* infectious but very low lethality. Then, once the entire world is infected, you buy heart failure.   Reality doesn't work like that - the same mutation doesn't arise simultaneously in all instances of the virus - but the important part, that high infectivity, low lethality viruses are S tier, is true. High infectivity and low lethality allows the virus to propagate and multiply. The more people are infected, the more copies of the virus there are. The more copies of the virus there are, the more opportunities the virus has to develop new mutations.   Omicron will already have mutated a bunch of times. Most of those mutations won't change anything. Some of them will make it less effective. Some of them will make it more infective. Some of them will make it more deadly, meaning it's both high infectivity and high lethality. When that happens (and it is a when, not an if), it'll become the next major variant and it could potentially be worse than the first wave. Basically, the fewer people infected, the less likely new mutations are to emerge. A strain that can infect a lot of people is bad because of the future mutation potential.  There's also a matter of simple maths. Imagine that Delta Covid infects 10,000 people per day and hospitalises 1% of infected. That's 100 new admissions to hospitals per day. Now imagine Omicron has half the hospitalisation rate of Delta, but has three times the infectivity. Omicron infects 30,000 people per day, and hospitalises 0.5% of them. That's 150 new admissions per day. That's worse overall even though Omicron is less lethal individually, because it's infecting so many more people.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why do \"red skies at morning\" mean it's going to storm later that day?",
    "answer": "It has to do with the scattering of incoming solar radiation. It is called Rayleigh scattering. the way weather systems travel is from west to east.   The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  Incoming solar radiation deflected sideways at an angle. If that angle is high then it brings about blue skies and such. If there is a blue sunrise that, to me, as a weather forecaster tells me I have low pressure to my east. The storm has passed.   As a result of low pressure being to my east, I will have high pressure to my west. High pressure is associated with good weather and great conditions. The high pressure is to come and move over my station.   High pressure brings about a low sun angle because it condenses the atmosphere. This low sun angle gives us our red sunrises and sunsets.  Edit: This is more of a mid latitude United States phenomenon. I decided to give it another shot\u2014 see below  Sun rises in the east and sets in the west.    Cool.   If at any point the sun rise or sun set is the color orange, red, or pink it can be inferred that the atmosphere is being condensed under the influence of high pressure. Because the sun is low in the sky and the atmosphere is condensed this is used to locate where high pressure is. Whether it is departing or arriving to you.   On the other hand, low pressure within the atmosphere allows it to expand. Therefore, wherever low pressure is located the sky at sun rise and sun set will not appear the colors aforementioned but will be your usual blue sky. This is due to the lack of condensation in the atmosphere. It allows the blue to be seen instead of the other colors on the visible spectrum.   In the mid latitudes (not the equator or the poles) between 60 degrees N and 30 degrees N there is the polar front jet (jet stream) that is high in the sky and it helps high pressure and low pressure move across mid latitudes in a west to east fashion as this is the only way the wind travels in the polar front jet. So this is the way low pressure systems (more commonly frontal boundaries) move with high pressure ahead and behind the fronts.   Weather is fluid and ever changing.

If you want to turn left you engage either the wheel or a lever that at first just opens the clutch to the left side track so only the right side is powered and moving faster but the left is free spinning and this will cause the tank to turn to the left.  If you need to turn really sharply you keep turning/pulling the lever and the brakes are applied to the left track so its now at a dead stop and only the right track is being powered this lets the tank make very sharp turns.

    "question": "ELI5 where does the money go when markets are down?",
    "answer": "Into different classes of assets, typically gold, government bonds, anything that investors view as more stable. That said, the *reason* markets are down is usually because of a sweeping price correction, ie: something people had *thought* was worth a lot of money suddenly turns out to be worth far less.  When times are \"good\" and everyone thinks they're getting rich, they'll be able to spend more money bidding up the price of investments, because that's generally the smartest thing to do with your money: Invest it into something which will earn you more money. The problem occurs when there's a new class of investment which appears to be \"too good to be true\". Dot.com stocks in 2001, Mortgage-backed securities in 2008, are good examples of this.  John Maynard Keynes, the economist for whom \"Keynesian Economics\" is named, uses a metaphor to describe the stock market: The [beauty contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest):  >Keynes described the action of rational agents in a market using an analogy based on a fictional newspaper contest, in which entrants are asked to choose the six most attractive faces from a hundred photographs. Those who picked the most popular faces are then eligible for a prize.  So, everyone is trying to guess what the most popular faces will be, not necessarily the faces they actually think are the most attractive. This phenomenon is how bubbles form. Many investors will put money into a bubble, on the undertaking that they're better off pumping their money with everyone else caught up in the enthusiasm, then dumping their position at the peak of the buying hysteria. Of course, that means timing is very important. Wait too long, and you can lose your stake on a wildly overinflated bubble, and fundamentally, the people holding bubble stocks are buying them on the hope they can find someone gullible enough to buy the stocks at their now-inflated price.  So, how does a bubble pop? Why can't everyone just keep trading back shares and making more and more money? Because investments are still tied to real things, and if those real things cease to exist, then the investment becomes worthless. So, if you have $100 in ABC stock, and ABC announces that they're going into bankruptcy restructuring because they're deeply in debt, suddenly your $100 worth of stock is worth much, much less, because it turns out the company you own is about to not exist.  This is what happened in 2008, and 2001. In both cases, the underlying asset people had bought shares in simply disappeared. The borrowers defaulted on their loans in 2008, and the dot.com businesses which weren't making profits closed, and the securities backed by these entities were suddenly worth nothing.  If this is an isolated company that's folding, no big deal, right? The people who are left holding worthless paper get hosed, but everyone else is unaffected. But when this starts to happen a *lot*, suddenly people who've been spending money based on overvalued assets are struck with a reality-check are unable to make payments. So, after your $100 worth of ABC stock vanished, you responsibly decide to stop your subscription for company DEF. In the next quarter, DEF reports that their revenue has dropped, and the putative value of DEF has dropped because it's now a less profitable company. Now the people holding DEF stock cut some expenses, and reduce the revenue of company GHI, and so on.  What's important to recognize is that economies are *reciprocal*. They call it the economic engine, after all. Your income is my expense, and vice-versa. When we all stop spending money, we all stop earning money, and suddenly everyone's cashflow gets tighter.",

    "answer": "I've answered this in another thread. The OS uses a generic command and ACPI BIOS to send power commands through the system bus to the Power Supply and Peripherals.  Each peripheral will enter a power mode and shutdown or move to an idle state in a safe manner. The onboard logic of each peripheral knows how to do this. So the hard drive will park safely and flush caches as needed. The CPU will enter a different CPU power state.  The Power Supply will then enter an idle power state and will switch state to full power after x amount of time.  As long as the power supply is plugged in and the ATX switch is on the power supply will be receiving power and will be active or idle. The computer may seem off but it is not.  A full shutdown wil place the power supply into idle and will not power certain devices of a certain power range so your hard drive and fans will be powered off.  Your CPU, Motherboard and some peripherals such as your network card will receive a small amount of power in this state.  A restart will bring all power lines back up to full power causing your hard drive to activate which will start the boot process.",

Secretory - your body secretes electrolytes into the lumen (open space in intestines).  2.

    "question": "Eli5, how does Fractional reserve banking work?...why is it considered the best option for today's banking?",
    "answer": "In fractional reserve banking, a bank is allowed to accept deposits and issue loans. It promises to let depositors withdraw their money when they please, but holds only part of its deposits in reserve in case they actually do. So effectively, by promising people access to more money than it actually holds in cash, a bank can introduce new money into the economy. This increase in liquidity encourages investment and economic growth. The system works so long as not too many people demand their money back at once (a \"run on the bank\").  This is like a Ponzi scheme in that there is a risk your deposit is not covered by cash actually held by the fund, but there's no element of fraud; the bank doesn't lie to you about where the interest it pays comes from or pretend to invest in assets in your name that don't actually exist. And the money it does make comes from real loans.  Governments control the risks of inflation from too much money from bank lending by making laws about how much the bank is required to hold in reserve, and by taking action with a central bank that then influences the lending behavior of other banks. They also create programs to insure deposits up to a certain amount, which eliminates the risk for depositors and thus the need to withdraw their savings if they are unsure about the bank, which also reduces risk for the bank.",

Sounds like the information sources I found are leaving out some important detail about how heat energy works cause this explanation does not compute. Anyone care to fill in the missing info?     Releasing the sweat does not have any cooling effect whatsoever. It needs to evaporate. The vast majority of body heat is lost in the form of evaporation energy. A liquid requires a certain threshold energy - enthalpy - to change into its gaseous form. That's where the body heat disappears.

As the temp in the room rises, the adhesive starts to undergo a transition from semi-solid to full on liquid which loosens the protein chains that are holding everything together, which causes the weight on the Command Hook to be enough to release the bond.

Arthritis pain: when the OTC pain killers don't cut it, other NSAIDs such as meloxicam (Mobic) or celecoxib (Celebrex) can be used. Easier on the stomach, harder on the heart.  More intense pain: injectable NSAIDs like ketorolac (Toradol) (really hard on kidneys) or opioids.   Nerve pain: not many great options, but gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), and a class of antidepressants called SNRIs (duloxetine and venlafaxine are the parent molecules) can be used. Methadone has also been useful in certain cases.   Centralized pain: this is a weird kind of pain where there isn't necessarily anything wrong, but you've been in pain so long that the pain center of your brain misfires and tells you you're in pain.

It's a measure of electric potential, or the difference in charge between two different points in a circuit. \"Ground\" is identified as a universal reference point for your system. All voltages are measured relative to something, and that something is typically the ground. And the ground has zero electric charge.  In the case of your house it's actually the neutral wire that's carrying current back , which is a bit more complicated to understand. There's some good [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-W42tk-fWc) videos that walk through it.   The question you're asking in residential 120V AC systems however, there's typically no current flowing through the ground wire. The neutral wire carries current back to the source and the ground wire is just a 0V reference point and a safety.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why is the economic middle class shrinking?",
    "answer": "Concentrating wealth is what a capitalist economic system is set up to do. Imagine you're Jeff Bezos. You have one high level goal in running Amazon - make money for yourself, and make money for your shareholders. You can accomplish that goal in two ways, sell more things and reduce your expenses. You're probably already selling as much as you can, so the easiest way to have the lowest possible expenses is to pay your employees as little as you can get away with. Most of the rest of the economy is run by other Bezoses who have more or less the same goals - workers are, as a result, forced to work for less than the value of their labour because there's a lack of better options.  Theres a snowball effect that takes place here - the bigger Amazon gets, the more money and influence you have and the more you're able to accept risks and expand your company - big companies have an easier time getting even bigger than smaller ones. You're also more able to influence government policy by lobbying or threatening to move jobs abroad if, say, minimum wage or tax rates were to increase. As more and more of the economy is absorbed by these massive corporations smaller businesses where individuals or small groups of employees have bargaining power fall by the wayside. A single worker at your company has no ability to demand a better wage since they can easily be fired and replaced by an even more desperate person who needs the wage to live.  To put it as simply as possible, those middle class jobs have begun to disappear because it's more profitable to pay your employees less. The less of those jobs there are the more people are forced to work lower paying jobs out of desperation, and as more people work in these jobs at or below the poverty line they become less able to have any influence on this system as they have no time to politically organize when they're working two jobs and no bargaining power when they're easily replaceable. Wealth being highly concentrated in the hands of a few people is the only expected outcome of a system that prioritizes profit margins above all else, and that system is self reinforcing.",

Typically a developer/builder would create a small community of homes, when you bought a property from them you would have to sign a contract agreeing to their terms. For example that you wouldn't paint the house neon orange or start collected rusted out trash cars on your lawn. Remember, they still have other properties to sell and they don't want you to trash your house and prevent them from getting a good deal selling the other homes. Eventually the builder will sell all the properties and the contract you signed gets handed off into a HOA made up of the owners of the various properties.  Eventually, anyone you sell your home to will have to sign the same contract as part of the purchase of the home. So it's legal because you willingly and freely signed a contract with mutual benefits.

You HOPE that the price lowers so you can pocket the difference. Example: If you borrow a stock from me, and sell for \u00a310, you want the price to lower. That way when the time comes to return it back to me, you buy it for the lower price of \u00a35, give it back to me, and you pocket the extra \u00a35.  To quickly go into what happened with GME, the hedgefunds borrowed ALL THE STOCKS that exists, AND THEN MORE STOCKS on top of that, thinking that the price of GME was gonna drop. In fairness, the Price had been in freefall for years and GameStop has been on its last legs for a long time. Smart people on Reddit noticed this, and brought all the stocks, which pushed the prices up. To translate this into the example: they borrowed and sold for $10 a share (not the correct price), but the price went up to about $300 per share. This put the hedgefunds in deficit by $290 per share (about $6Billion total). They had also borrowed more stocks than actually existed.

Even the factories which have side tracks from the days of cheaper labor no longer use these as reloading the cargo onto a one or two car train for final delivery still costs too much.  However when enough cargo to fill a train is to be sent from one place to another then freight trains are still undisputed. Other places do have cargo collected in order to be sent on a freight train for longer distances as the reloading cost is lower then the cost of long distance trucks.

Most functions that people use in real life take in a real number and give you back a different real number.  However, there are also things called complex numbers. These numbers have a real part, and an imaginary part. This is just a different kind of number. A laplace transform turns a function with a real variable into a function with a complex variable. These functions won't be the same, but you can go back and forth from real to complex then back to real.

So our phones can have pretty small, built-in antennas.  Antennas for high bandwidth you use to receive satellite signals are typically larger and directional. That's why you have a dish with high directional gain for TV or satellite internet.  And satellite telephones typically still have an antenna sticking out. It's not just about the broadcasting signal, but also the receiver. Dish antennas are very directional.  > atmosphere  Also keep in mind different frequencies get through the atmosphere more easily.   > cellular can only  reach 2-3 miles  You have high bandwidth, frequencies effected by moisture in the air, and buildings, landscape in the way.

    "answer": "The US government partly funds itself by issuing bonds (basically a specialized type of loan). Like any loan, they pay interest. For US government bonds issued by the US Treasury, we call this the \"treasury yield\". It's effectively the interest rate you get from loaning money to the US government. These are considered about the safest possible investment so any more risky loan (which is basically all of them) is going to have a higher interest than the treasury yield. If the treasury yield goes up (the government is paying higher interest), that pushes up the interest rate of \\*all\\* loans. It's a signal that investors are concerned that some combination of 1) the stock market might be dropping, so they're putting their money somewhere safer (bonds) and/or 2) investors are worried about inflation and want a higher yield to make up the value they're going to lose to inflation.  Right now it's some of both, hence the investors freaking out. If inflation gets high, investments have to perform better just to stay ahead of inflation, so their value goes down.

It refers to the thought process of \"I already spent some money on this. It would be a shame if I stopped spending money on it now.\" In other words, throwing \"good money after bad money.\"  You could imagine the fallacy as \"I bought a boat for $100, but then it sunk in the river. Because I don't want my $100 to be wasted, I'm going to rent a truck for $50 to pull it out. If that truck sinks into the mud, then I'll buy a different truck for $75 so that my $150 isn't wasted.\" The pattern then repeats.

    "answer": "Two things happen when you shoot a bullet in general: it accelerates towards the earth (by gravity), and it decelerates because of friction.  If you shoot straight up, the acceleration towards the earth and the friction both work together at slowing down the bullet, until it reaches a point where its vertical speed (velocity) is zero: if you were standing there on an air balloon you could catch the bullet with your hand without getting hurt at all.   If the bullet had a lot of energy going out of the barrel, it now has none. What it has, though, is height, and it is still being accelerated by gravity! Since the friction is zero at this point, the bullet will simply fall and gain speed.  Going down, as its speed increases, so will the friction : at some point the friction will be so strong that the bullet won't accelerate due to gravity anymore: it will have reached its terminal velocity. This should be about 350km/h for a bullet, or 200m/h.  This is the speed at which it will hit the ground. Enough to hurt someone badly, but maybe not to kill.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why do matrices get transposed and what's the use of this function in the real world?",
    "answer": "If you want to do machine learning I don't think it makes sense to start learning the coding side with little to no math background. Some linear algebra and statistics are going to make it much easier for you to understand what you're doing. Otherwise you just end up copying bits of code that make no sense to you.   That being said, matrices and the operations you can do on them are basically just convenient mathematical shorthand for working with sets of numbers that have a certain structure to them. For instance, in a matrix the rows often correspond to one variable, and the columns to another. For instance, each column might be a quantity that you measured, and then each row contains a set of simultaneous measurements of all these quantities. To make that even more concrete, each row might be a different house, and then the columns might be the square footage, distance to the nearest mall, and price of each house.   In other words, matrices are basically just tables, but without the headers that tell you what each row or column represents.  Transposing a matrix just means swapping the rows and columns. So in our example, you now would have square footage in row 1, distance to nearest mall in row 2, and price in row 3, and then each column is now a different house for which you recorded those three numbers.   Why do we transpose? That has to do with the operations you can do on matrices. Specifically,  matrix multiplication. Matrix multiplication is different from *scalar* multiplication (scalars are just single numbers, as opposed to vectors or matrices which contain multiple numbers). If you have two scalars *a* and *b*, then *ab* = *ba.* That is, the order of multiplication doesn't matter. But if you have two matrices, *A* and *B*, then in general, you don't have *AB = BA.* And in fact, you may not even be able to compute both of these products. That's because, for matrix multiplication, the dimensions of the matrices need to match up in a certain way. For instance, if *A* is a \\[10 x 3\\] matrix, that means it has 10 rows and 3 columns. Now let's say *B* is a \\[3 x 8\\] matrix. In that case, the matrix product *AB* will have size \\[10 x 8\\]. The sizes that went into the multiplication were \\[10 x 3\\]\\*\\[3 x 8\\]. Notice that the 3 matches up between the two matrices, and disappears from the resulting matrix. That's important. If these numbers didn't match up, then you couldn't multiply these matrices. For instance, if *A* were \\[10 x 5\\], for instance, then you simply wouldn't be able to multiply *A* by *B*.   But let's go back to the situation where *A* was \\[10 x 3\\]. We were able to compute the matrix product *AB* because the dimensions matched up. But if we swap the order to *BA*, now the dimensions that go into the product are \\[3 x 8\\]\\*\\[10 x 3\\]. Now the \"outer\" dimensions match up, but that's no good. It has to be the \"inner\" dimensions that are the same.   This is all just to illustrate that matrix products depend on having dimensions that match up in a certain way. Note that I haven't described how to actually calculate a matrix product, and I won't go into that. Again, I highly recommend that you take a (free, online) linear algebra course to learn all about that. All you need to remember for now is that there is this operation called a matrix product and it depends on getting the matrix dimensions to match up.  Now suppose that we have a matrix *C* that has size \\[3 x 7\\]. Can we multiply this with *B* (which is \\[3 x 8\\]? Not as it is. *CB* would be \\[3 x 7\\]\\*\\[3 x 8\\], and *BC* would be \\[3 x 8\\]\\*\\[3 \\* 7\\]. The inner dimensions don't match in either case. But what if we *transpose* *C*? Recall that this means swapping the rows and columns. We write the transposed version of *C* as *C**^(T)**.* When we transpose, the dimensions of the matrix are swapped, so *C**^(T)* has size \\[7 x 3\\]. Aha, but that means that we *can* calculate the product *C**^(T)**B*! Because then we're multiplying matrices of dimensions \\[7 x 3\\]\\*\\[3 x 8\\], so now the inner dimensions *do* match up, and the result is a new matrix of size \\[7 x 8\\].   So in short, there are operations that we can do on matrices, which depend on the arrangement of their rows and columns. Transposing a matrix changes this arrangement in a particular way, that is very often useful or necessary.",

However the problem with the mechanics of economic control are older going back to the 1970s at least.  At it's core inflation is too many dollars (or other currency) chasing too few goods.

    "question": "eli5: Why do commonly used items, such as CRT's or old consoles skyrocket in value after they stop production? Assuming that these items stopped production today, why do sealed boxes or hell even good condition second-hand items almost double in price mere weeks after the end of production?",
    "answer": "CRTs have some advantages over LCDs and other flat-panel display technologies that matter for certain niche applications. To the typical consumer, the advantages of flat panels outweigh these rather specific disadvantages, and also different flat panel technologies have complementary strengths so most people don't need a CRT. So once flat panels became cheap enough to be accessible to most consumers, CRT production took a nosedive. But the niche market for them remained, and so now you have a situation where the supply is almost 0 but there is still some demand for it. Of course, you could argue that supply could still track demand and so prices should be unaffected, but that's not the case because (1) with this big drop in production, economies of scale have been lost and so it's more expensive to manufacture a CRT monitor these days and (2) the demand is no longer from average consumers who want to pay low prices for medium-quality products, but rather it comes from specialists or enthusiasts who need CRTs with specific, high-quality specifications and are willing to pay more for that.  Of course, the second point does not explain why even older, second-hand CRTs have gone up in price. That's more due to point (1) combined with a somewhat separate (though overlapping) demand from enthusiasts and collectors who don't care so much about performance.  Anyway, in short: CRTs are an example of a product that has gotten more expensive because the mass market for it disappeared, and now it's turned into a niche market, where costs are higher and customers are willing to pay more.  Things like old consoles, where production has fully and permanently stopped, are a different situation, because there you're dealing with a somewhat steady (if small) demand combined with a steadily dwindling supply (that will eventually drop to 0). So e.g. if you really want to buy a NES today, your options are very limited as you're dependent on the ever-decreasing number of NES's in the world that still work, *and* that people are willing to sell. So even though very few people are looking to buy NES's, the supply is even smaller.  I'm not sure it's accurate to say that these consoles shoot up in price weeks after their production ends (that would surprise me but I'm happy to be corrected on that). By that point, presumably nearly everyone who wanted to buy one already did so, and people who couldn't previously afford one now are looking to buy one cheaper in the second-hand market that is ramping up. Also, often consoles that go out of production are superseded by newer models and the bulk of the demand will switch to them, while the collectors' market will take years to get off the ground. The only exception I can think of would be if the manufacturer (for some atypical reason) stopped producing the console before they had exhausted the (profitable) demand for it (and didn't release a new console yet).",

ARM is a reduced instruction set ([RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer)) architecture, while x86 is a complex instruction set ([CSIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer)) architecture. The ELI5 version of that is x86 has way more instructions in its language, and the shape and behavior of those instructions are far more complicated.  For example, x86 instructions are variable-length, meaning the instruction decoder needs to read each byte to determine how many more bytes to read next in order to decode the instruction.  The x86 ISA also has instructions that can manipulate memory directly, while in ARM, you would have to perform all operations on registers before storing those registers back to memory with an appropriate instruction. Technically it's an abstraction, since under the hood, the CPU may well be loading the memory location into a hidden register, performing the requested operation on it, and then store it back to memory, but to you it looks like one instruction.

Elsewhere the population was basically let live like they were as taxes were paid, trade and resources went according to their rules, they had access to bases and occasionally got soldiers. Basically the same method as what Romans used.  The amount of resources it takes to convert a population culturally is immense, and if you can control them without having to do that, it is a huge benefit.  Portugal and Spain meanwhile did put lot of effort it to converting the populations by force. Which is why there are about 1.3 Billion Catholics, a  high percent of which are in their old colonies.",

This energy then heats up the other materials (other protons and electrons and such) nearby. This heating eventually grows out from the center (or core) of the star to the outside, finally leaving the surface and radiating out into space to be the heat and light we know stars emit.

The speed of the surface doesn't matter, humans can't feel the speed, we only feel the change in speed, which is acceleration. And by rotating once every 24 hours the change in the direction of the speed is very small. Earth also rotates very uniformly and to same direction, so even with faster rotation, it would just feel like the gravity is weaker.  This is called centrifugal force, which can be calculated for the earth:  [https://i.imgur.com/PSXL6K5.png](https://i.imgur.com/PSXL6K5.png)  So if we put a human on the equator and calculate how much the centrifugal force of the rotating earth makes the human lighter, it's about 2 newtons of force, which is about 200 grams lighter on earth's surface.

    "answer": "It's actually why you're told not to stick a fork in a toaster!   Electricity has a \"direction\". Think of it like a water hose. Water goes in one end and comes out of the other end.   One side of the plug is the \"hot\" side, that's how electricity gets in to your device. The other side is the \"neutral\" side. That's how electricity gets out of your device.   To some extent it doesn't matter which way the plug is plugged in. If you plug a toaster in the \"wrong\" way it will still work. This is just like a water hose, if you put it on \"backwards\" it still works. Some electronics may be damaged if you do this, but there's a better reason why these plugs are built this way.  The right way for electricity to flow through a toaster is from the \"hot\" wire to a switch. If that switch is \"closed\" (you've turned the toaster on), electricity keeps going through the toaster and heats up the heating elements, then leaves through the neutral wire. If you have the plug turned this way and the switch is \"open\" (the toaster is not on), you can stick a fork in the toaster safely because the electricity has stopped at the switch. There is no electricity in the heating elements because the neutral wire is the \"out\" wire.   But if you plug the toaster in the other way, electricity flows from the hot side of your outlet through the neutral wire, into the heating elements, then it hits the switch. It can't actually make the toaster heat up because that takes a flow of electricity. But if you put a fork in the toaster, that fork forms a path from the hot wire to the ground through your arm, body, leg, and foot. You become the switch and turn on the toaster. That's bad news.  Same thing with lamps. If it's plugged in hot-to-hot, the switch is why you can safely change a bulb. If it's hot-to-neutral, you might get shocked if you're not super careful.   So modern devices usually have this kind of plug. It's called a \"polarized\" plug, which is a sort of misuse of that word. In a general sense it means it \"has a direction\". This ensures you don't accidentally plug a device in a way that's unsafe. But not all devices have a way to stick a fork inside or a switch to stop electrical flow, so those devices might use an unpolarized plug. For example, I don't think my laptop charger's polarized. But I also have no clue how the heck to open it, so by the time I stick a fork in it I've already made at least four other bad decisions and it's not Apple's fault.",

    "answer": "Our bodies are made up of tiny cells, that constantly replicate themselves to upkeep your organs and tissues. Sometimes, during this replication, the DNA inside the cell mutates because it\u2019s copied incorrectly, so the cell becomes different. Sometimes the mutation is benign and doesn\u2019t do anything harmful, but sometimes, it turns the cell rogue, so it starts to replicate itself uncontrollably and form massive tumors. Cells usually have checkpoints in place to regulate how fast they divide, but cancer cells have mutated aspects of these checkpoints so that they no longer apply to them.",

    "question": "Eli5: Oil deposits. How can there be so many fossils together to make an oil bed? Did the tectonic plates just shifted to planko the remain\u2019s together?",
    "answer": "The plankton and algae that die and become deposited on the ocean floor are the source of oil. When many layers of these dead ocean microorganisms pile up in layers, the layers compact on each other due to the weight. This is known as lithifaction. This can make thick layers of concentrated organic matter, especially as it gets buried deep below ground where heat and pressure break down organics into oil. (but not too deep, the earth gets hotter with depth, the oil turns to graphite/carbon if its too deep).  Oil is trapped underground by different types of rocks- Some allow water, oil, and gasses to move through it, like sandstones or shales (along the layers) while other rocks don't allow it to travel through it (perpendicular to the layers in shale), and mudstones. These are called permeable rocks vs impermeable rocks- and they are important in keeping the oil from diluting into other rock layers as something that can't be mined. You have different layers of ocean rock because of seasons and climates. Some seasons and climates favor plankton, others do not. Since over time these change, you have different rock layers.   This doesn't mean that the ocean rock is oil rich, the rock must concentrate the oil some to make it something that can be extracted generally. Oil will have water with it, and water helps dissolve the gasses and volatiles. You have geologic events that create folds in the ground (called anticlines, synclines, domes) that move the oil/gas to concentrated areas where liquid oil can be pumped out of.   &#x200B;  So, in short the plankton is concentrated in the rock, buried deeply with tons of pressure and heat, and then plate tectonics helps concentrate the oil in pockets.  -Geologist in training.",

So if you're a family that has your kids help you on the farm they can use your tiller or tractors, etc. The idea of the agricultural license is to allow a working kid to be able to get between the farms various fields that sometimes require a few minutes on public roads since some farms are big or have fields in different areas.

    "question": "ELI5: Why does driving at high (interstate) speeds and hitting standing water (deep enough to splash) cause you to feel a push perpendicular to your car's movement?",
    "answer": "Hoo boy. That is a simple question with a very complex answer. To understand why you need to understand torque and angular momentum in spinning bodies.  So the basics you need to know is we measure the force of something spinning by its angular momentum. This force is a tangent to the circle or a straight line only intersecting the spin at one point. You can visualize this by spinning something on the end of a string then letting it go. That object on a string will fly off in one direction. That direction is the direction of the force being applied at that moment. Which indicates to you the direction of it's angular momentum.  Now we go to torque. To make something spin it needs to be fixed to a singular point. There must be an axis which it spins around and resists that straight line force we call angular momentum. Otherwise the spin would just turn to linear force. As we know from physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. So as the axis pulls against the object, so to must the object pull against the axis. That pull on the axis is what we call a torque. The direction of that torque force is defined with a right hand rule. If you point your right hand and curl your fingers in the direction of the spin and stick your thumb out, the direction of your thumb is the direction of the torque force. Notice your thumb is now pointing perpendicular to the spin.   (A YouTube video to explain it in depth https://youtu.be/mRZGdvJQnPU)  Now we tie that back into your car. So all 4 wheels on your car are spinning. As we just established that means they have angular momentum and torque. Fortunately for you the torque is normally not enough to overcome the friction between your tires and the road. So you never feel that torque. However, when you hit a deep enough puddle, all that friction is removed and the perpendicular torque force of your car easily can pull you sideways.",

My opinion is that one group wants true history being taught. i.e. slaves were not immigrants. Native Americans were here first. And another group wants to teach American exceptionalism and not teach the negative parts of US history.   Many conservatives claim that Critical Race Theory teaches that all white people are racist and that white people should all feel guilty.   I disagree and think that those ideas are more from the books White Fragility and How to be Anti Racist.   Critical Race Theory is a legal / law school topic. I don\u2019t know anyone that\u2019s being taught this in K-12.   Black History,Native American history and US history should be taught honestly and accurately.

Knowing how many pre-orders there were helped game companies gauge the sort of popularity the game would have. Lots of useful information for them, and money in the bank.   The downside for consumers was that reviews for the game would come out after people had bought the game, so if it wasn't all that good, it was too late for those buyers unless they went through the hassle of refunding it.    These days, there is no physical disc. Games are bought and installed off of the internet. Steam or PSN or Xbox live have unlimited copies to sell the moment the clock hits 00:00.

The reason why others don't do it is energy, and money. \"What you are missing here\" is the sheer amount of water needed and how much that would cost. Let's break it down.  **California consumes 38 billion (**[**38,000,000,000) gallons of water per day**](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2014/08/21/usgs-estimates-vast-amounts-water-used-california/14400333/)**.**  Producing desalinated water has a big cost range depending on the type of plant and how big it is, but it's something like [$2 per 325 gallons.](https://www.wired.com/story/desalination-is-booming-as-cities-run-out-of-water/) Therefore, making enough fresh water for California is going to cost **$233 million** ***per day***\\*.\\*  Oh and you have to build the desalination plants first! A desalination plant that can produce [100 million gallons per day costs $658 million](https://www.twdb.texas.gov/innovativewater/desal/faq.asp). So for California's 38 billion gallons per day, you need to build 380 such mega-plants, which would cost **$250 billion total**. Plus the $233M per day to operate the plants.  Oh and then you have to transport all the fresh water from those 380 plants along the coast to where it's needed. Water is very heavy, so shipping is tough. You either need to move 38 billion gallons a day in train tankers + trucks, or construct thousands of miles of huge-diameter pipelines across the whole state. I don't have numbers there but both options are $$$ once again.   Overall, it's physically possible but just not feasible on the scale needed to actually help a state-wide drought.  There are environmental costs too, since desalination plants using a ton of energy also means they produce a lot of greenhouse gases. Going back to Saudi Arabia example, they estimate 25% of all oil and gas burned in the country is for desalination.

Remember the orbitals are electron clouds, its where you have the best chance of finding the electron, its not a rigid path. If you just need to understand to complete assignments, just remember spin directions must oppose in the same orbital/shell.. one up, one down, and so on.. electrons are negatively charged so they ALWAYS repel eachother.   Also, electrons are so small that they do not follow the laws of physics as you and I follow them.

    "answer": "> And then you can modulate the wave so it carries data. For digital modulation, that means you vary the amplitude or power level of the transmission.  And/or you can vary the frequency or phase. In FM transmission, you would change your 2400MHz signal up or down by up to 10MHz, and your 'bandwidth' would be just that - your band width, the difference between the lowest and highest frequency you're sending.  Other modulation schemes which use phase and amplitude together are in use too. One example is [QAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation).  If you're transmitting a digital AM signal by pulsing a single carrier frequency on and off, then your bandwidth is the result of a tradeoff based on how fast you're pulsing on and off relative to the frequency of the carrier wave. If you're pulsing a carrier wave on and off very fast, approaching the frequency of the carrier itself, then the spectrum of what you're sending gets quite wide. If you transmit a pure 2400MHz signal at constant level forever, never stopping or starting, then that would be a 0 bandwidth signal, a pure frequency. But when the signal is stopping and starting, the band gets wider than 0. This is just a mathematical consequence of how frequencies work.

Afterwards there are return vessels that collect the blood from the capillaries and tissues to be returned to the heart, but the pressure in these vessels is much lower. Think about blood which has flowed through tissues in the legs, how will it get back up the heart when the pressure from the heart is behind all that slow-flowing tissue blood?  There are various mechanisms that help this including one-way valves in the legs that close off to avoid backflow of blood, allowing it to sort of ratchet its way back up to the torso. But another helpful factor is that the powerful leg muscles are continually contracting and squeezing the vessels as they do their job of balancing us as we stand or walk. Locking the legs takes most of the strain off the leg muscles and allows them to relax, which is what someone in a band formation might want for example, but it also removes that helpful blood pushing effect.  So when someone locks their legs it makes it harder for blood to be returned to the heart which in turn will generally drop blood pressure overall, reducing the amount that can make it to the brain.

My grandparents weren\u2019t eating out all the time, sucking down 5+ dollar coffees daily, energy drinks, paying for expensive cell phones and data plans with another internet bill at home. They didn\u2019t spend hours a day shopping on Amazon or having door dash bring dinner that doubles the price, they weren\u2019t paying for childcare and Netflix or cable even. They had a very basic set of bills every month and because of that they were able to pay cash for their land then keep saving till they could afford to build their house with out borrowed money, that saves all that interest that we pay for.

    "question": "Eli5: what exactly are magnetic fields, and how exactly do they do what magnets do?",
    "answer": "Imagine that everywhere in space is filled with little arrows that can be of different sizes and point in different directions. [This page has cool pictures demonstrating this.](https://mathinsight.org/vector_field_overview) All those little arrows are a field. Throughout all of space are different types of these fields. The magnetic field is one of these.  When you have something that's magnetic, it means that it has the property of affecting the field. It's affecting the size and direction of all those little arrows. [Example image.](http://www.evsc.net/v8/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/dipole_field02-300x228.gif) Any other object inside of a magnetic field will then feel a force on it because of its interaction with that field.  For physical magnets, like the kind you stick to your fridge, they get their magnetism by essentially being made up of a bunch of tiny magnets. The particles that make up atoms have a natural magnetic field due to a fundamental property they have, called \"spin\". This makes them like tiny magnets. If all these tiny magnets are pointing in random directions, they cancel each other out overall. On the other hand, if they arrange themselves to point in the same direction, the magnetic fields don't cancel out. Instead they add together and the whole object becomes a magnet.",

    "answer": "> Before the 19th century, countries were simply declaring endless wars for the most useless motivations and would only receive a retaliation from the country's allies and your rivals.  This is just totally incorrect.   The 7 years war (1756\u20131763) was all about the balance of power between Brittan and France and spilled over into the balance of power in central Europe resulting in the emergence of Prussia at the expense of Austria and Sweden.  The war of the Spanish succession (1701-1714) Was about the HRE being too powerful and every one ganging up to strip Spain off from it.   The 30 years (1618 to 1648) was all about the balance of power between the big players of Europe. Namely the HRE and France.  The 100 years (1337\u20131453) drew in Scotland, Aragon, Castile and Bohemia, on the French side to stop England from conquering France.  There are a huge number of wars (650c-1000c) between the Eastern roman empire and like every eastern European state known to man over how far roman influence would be.

    "answer": "Bitcoin and those styles of decentralized currency don't have a central database to hack. Every transaction/mining operation is verified by the entire network (everyone who is mining), so you'd need a majority of those people to be in on the scam in order to pull it off. If you report a different transaction than everyone else, your transaction gets discarded as \"incorrect\".  Centralized systems like banks use double-entry bookkeeping. That means that, for every addition to an account, there must either be a subtraction from another account (transferring funds) or a physical input (cashing a check or depositing cash). So the system admin would have to either fake transactions from real accounts (in which the owners would quickly find out) or try to fake a physical interaction (counterfeit money or a fraudulent check) in order to gain money for themselves.  It should be self-evident that, if you're making counterfeit money that can pass bank inspections, you're in a far different tier than hacking bank accounts. And the banks' digital security is generally very good.

    "answer": "So as you know, sound is just energy causing vibrations in the air at a specific frequency. That frequency can be expressed as a wave with peaks and valleys. These waves will interfere with each other in a few ways put for our purposes there are two ways, constructive and destructive interference. Constructive interference is when the peak of one wave meets another peak, thus the energy adds together and makes the energy grow. Destructive interference is when the peak of one wave meets the valley of the other and the energy cancels out.  Noise cancelling headphones work on destructive interference. They use a tiny microphone on the outside of the headphones in order to detect outside sound. They usually focus on deep bass sounds as they have the best chance of penetrating the headphones. Then they play a sound at the frequency of that bass into the headphones which then cancels out the energy, thus silencing the bass and the noise produced to cancel the bass.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why are long haul trips like airplane rides and bus rides so exhausting, even though all we do is sit?",
    "answer": "One important consideration is the constant body position. Sitting around the house when you're relaxing, you'll be shifting positions periodically, leaning forward, leaning back, bearing more weight on your hipbones or your thighs, lifting or crossing or uncrossing your legs, etc.  A long car or plane ride doesn't give you nearly as much freedom to do that. The sitting position is pretty rigid, and you might be able to lean the seat further back or more upright, but that's typically about all the freedom you get. Add to this the fact that you're actively balancing even as you sit, if there is any wobbling, bumpiness or G-forces on the ride. You can't fully relax in a car because muscles in your back and abdomen are constantly responding to the little lateral forces produced by handling the car. Depending on the size of the plane and the air conditions, the same might be true on a flight.  Finally, the sensory input can be mentally exhausting. Highway driving is noisy, and can expose you to pretty fast-moving visual scenery which, even if you're not really paying attention to it, your brain might be noticing and spending some energy on. Planes in flight are also very loud places to be. That can wear you down and push you toward mental fatigue.",

    "answer": "The plankton and algae that die and become deposited on the ocean floor are the source of oil. When many layers of these dead ocean microorganisms pile up in layers, the layers compact on each other due to the weight. This is known as lithifaction. This can make thick layers of concentrated organic matter, especially as it gets buried deep below ground where heat and pressure break down organics into oil. (but not too deep, the earth gets hotter with depth, the oil turns to graphite/carbon if its too deep).  Oil is trapped underground by different types of rocks- Some allow water, oil, and gasses to move through it, like sandstones or shales (along the layers) while other rocks don't allow it to travel through it (perpendicular to the layers in shale), and mudstones. These are called permeable rocks vs impermeable rocks- and they are important in keeping the oil from diluting into other rock layers as something that can't be mined. You have different layers of ocean rock because of seasons and climates. Some seasons and climates favor plankton, others do not. Since over time these change, you have different rock layers.   This doesn't mean that the ocean rock is oil rich, the rock must concentrate the oil some to make it something that can be extracted generally. Oil will have water with it, and water helps dissolve the gasses and volatiles. You have geologic events that create folds in the ground (called anticlines, synclines, domes) that move the oil/gas to concentrated areas where liquid oil can be pumped out of.   &#x200B;  So, in short the plankton is concentrated in the rock, buried deeply with tons of pressure and heat, and then plate tectonics helps concentrate the oil in pockets.  -Geologist in training.",

Why do they want you to look at a screen? You may ask.  Advertising.  Companies want to make money, and in order to do this they need to let people know about their products. But advertising your products costs a lot of money when you are trying to reach a wider audience.  So they target specific demographics.  Where before, they would've advertised on a certain website, or in a certain area, advertisers can now target specific people. People they know like the kind of things they are selling. People of a particular age and gender who like to purchase products similar to yours.  By targeting more specifically, they have more chance of making a sale per dollar spent on advertising. So companies who harvest data from us sell it to 3rd party advertisers.

    "answer": "Interaction is a very broad term. When two particles interact it means they have an effect on each other, there are lots of different ways this can happen but perhaps the simplest is that of two particles with the same charge repelling each other.   When two electrons exist near each other they repel, this interaction is due to the electromagnetic force. When an electron and a proton are near each other their interaction is attractive rather than repulsive as they have opposite charges.   There are also more complex interactions where particles are converted into different types, when an electron and a positron (antimatter counterpart of an electron) interact they annihilate and two photons are released. Similarly two photons can interact to generate a positron and electron.",

Last time I connected to a New York server the latency was about **100ms**.    The distance from Central Europe to New York is about 6000km. There is no straight line connection from me to there so let's add a 50% margin for extra cable length - 9000km of routing equipment, copper and fiber optics.   Latency is given for the signal to travel there and back, so a total travel distance of 18000km.   c is 300000km/s so light in a vacuum would travel the 18000km in about **60ms**.   The signal doesn't travel at that speed through fiber and copper though, only at a high-double-digit fraction of c.       Add to that the possible overhead from quality of service operations and routing equipment compute times and about a 100ms ping would seem like *exactly* what you'd expect - not at all an astronomical discrepancy.",

Many types of tumors can communicate with the body and request blood vessels be built to them and consume resources meant for other organs. In addition, they grow virulently and can grow around critical blood vessels and organs making it essentially impossible to cut out the entire tumor without risking killing the patient. Sometimes the tumors can grow and kill off the cells that form the walls of organs complicating the removal process. If even a single cancerous cell is left behind and not destroyed by the body - it can grow back into another tumor, so it can carry many risks.  Lastly, the most dangerous types of cancer are tumors that actively spread freely throughout the body. Cells can break off and float throughout the body and embed themselves elsewhere growing new masses simultaneously everywhere in the body. At this stage the tumors are likely inoperable - the only way to fight them is chemically or via other means.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why can some electric plugs (US) go in an outlet \"backwards\" and some not?",
    "answer": "It's actually why you're told not to stick a fork in a toaster!   Electricity has a \"direction\". Think of it like a water hose. Water goes in one end and comes out of the other end.   One side of the plug is the \"hot\" side, that's how electricity gets in to your device. The other side is the \"neutral\" side. That's how electricity gets out of your device.   To some extent it doesn't matter which way the plug is plugged in. If you plug a toaster in the \"wrong\" way it will still work. This is just like a water hose, if you put it on \"backwards\" it still works. Some electronics may be damaged if you do this, but there's a better reason why these plugs are built this way.  The right way for electricity to flow through a toaster is from the \"hot\" wire to a switch. If that switch is \"closed\" (you've turned the toaster on), electricity keeps going through the toaster and heats up the heating elements, then leaves through the neutral wire. If you have the plug turned this way and the switch is \"open\" (the toaster is not on), you can stick a fork in the toaster safely because the electricity has stopped at the switch. There is no electricity in the heating elements because the neutral wire is the \"out\" wire.   But if you plug the toaster in the other way, electricity flows from the hot side of your outlet through the neutral wire, into the heating elements, then it hits the switch. It can't actually make the toaster heat up because that takes a flow of electricity. But if you put a fork in the toaster, that fork forms a path from the hot wire to the ground through your arm, body, leg, and foot. You become the switch and turn on the toaster. That's bad news.  Same thing with lamps. If it's plugged in hot-to-hot, the switch is why you can safely change a bulb. If it's hot-to-neutral, you might get shocked if you're not super careful.   So modern devices usually have this kind of plug. It's called a \"polarized\" plug, which is a sort of misuse of that word. In a general sense it means it \"has a direction\". This ensures you don't accidentally plug a device in a way that's unsafe. But not all devices have a way to stick a fork inside or a switch to stop electrical flow, so those devices might use an unpolarized plug. For example, I don't think my laptop charger's polarized. But I also have no clue how the heck to open it, so by the time I stick a fork in it I've already made at least four other bad decisions and it's not Apple's fault.",

Presumably it has a processor in it and lots of memory, so arguably it's a whole computer, totally devoted to making the images you see on the screen.  It's very possible that the processor in the GPU is faster and has more memory than the CPU (Central Processor Unit) of the computer itself, as well as having more memory available to it. This is for high end graphics, including high resolution, 3D motion, game graphics. etc..  Back in the day, the Display Adapter simply sent out to the screen whatever was in the display memory area of the computer. It was put there by the CPU. In fact one inexpensive computer (Timex) used the back-scan part of the image generation to run actual computation. So you could speed up your program by selectively turning off the display.

Patronizing is like when someone praises you for something inappropriate for your age level. If someone said to you \"Aw, you know the color red! Amazing!\" It could be a tease, but it's also patronizing because you probably have know what red is since before you can remember.   Condescending is more like if your teacher said \"Don't you know how to do algebra?

    "answer": "Well, we can! For example, in Saudi Arabia about half of total water usage comes from desalination of salt water.  The reason why others don't do it is energy, and money. \"What you are missing here\" is the sheer amount of water needed and how much that would cost. Let's break it down.  **California consumes 38 billion (**[**38,000,000,000) gallons of water per day**](https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2014/08/21/usgs-estimates-vast-amounts-water-used-california/14400333/)**.**  Producing desalinated water has a big cost range depending on the type of plant and how big it is, but it's something like [$2 per 325 gallons.](https://www.wired.com/story/desalination-is-booming-as-cities-run-out-of-water/) Therefore, making enough fresh water for California is going to cost **$233 million** ***per day***\\*.\\*  Oh and you have to build the desalination plants first! A desalination plant that can produce [100 million gallons per day costs $658 million](https://www.twdb.texas.gov/innovativewater/desal/faq.asp). So for California's 38 billion gallons per day, you need to build 380 such mega-plants, which would cost **$250 billion total**. Plus the $233M per day to operate the plants.  Oh and then you have to transport all the fresh water from those 380 plants along the coast to where it's needed. Water is very heavy, so shipping is tough. You either need to move 38 billion gallons a day in train tankers + trucks, or construct thousands of miles of huge-diameter pipelines across the whole state. I don't have numbers there but both options are $$$ once again.   Overall, it's physically possible but just not feasible on the scale needed to actually help a state-wide drought.  There are environmental costs too, since desalination plants using a ton of energy also means they produce a lot of greenhouse gases. Going back to Saudi Arabia example, they estimate 25% of all oil and gas burned in the country is for desalination.  If you have a few minutes and want a pile of easily-understandable info on your exact question, I highly recommend the article [The World Can Make More Water From the Sea, but at What Cost?](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/climate/desalination-water-climate-change.html) by the NY Times.",

Based on their depictions it feels like it would take far longer for one of these giants to do that. How come?  They're giant. The distance from their shoulder to the (giant) table is further than the distance from your shoulder to a normal sized table.

    "answer": "It is a great question. The analogy of water flowing in a pipe, sort of breaks down once you get to the level of electrons and such.   1) Electrons are not massless particles. Therefore electrons cannot travel at the speed of light. The explanation is from Einstein: that anything with mass would need infinite energy to accelerate to the speed of light.   2) What is \"moving\" at the speed of light is the change in the electromagnetic field. The term used is propagate rather than move.   3) The speed of individual electrons cannot actually be measured with precision. But the presence of a voltage in wire will induce a \"general flow\" of electrons in one direction. (Imagine water in a turbulent river - we cannot say what speed any particular drop of water is moving but we can tell how fast the entire flow is moving in general) This flow speed is called \"drift velocity\" and is called drift because in most circumstances it is VERY slow.   4) Drift velocity direction depends on which side of the wire has higher voltage relative to the other. In power grids, the voltage is AC, so it swings from positive to negative. In effect the drift velocity switches each time the voltage switches signs and therefore the average drift velocity in the power grid is ZERO. That is, electrons aren't \"shooting out\" at one end of an electric cable.   So one can imagine electrons essentially moving backwards and forwards but not really going anywhere. This is just an illustration - electrons don't organize themselves like balls of stuff and their actual motion isn't like cars going down a road.",

Most of the ideas about what these neurons do involve thinking about other people, but I think there are some that just involve thinking generally, so there are motor neurons that you use to perform an action (consciously) and mirror neurons that are involved in thinking about it, whether or not you are performing it.  And, of course, there are plenty of motions that happen that we only are aware of as/after they happen, dimly or not at all.  Edit: like other people have pointed out, there is a lot of debate around this topic.",

    "answer": "Well as a total it's kinda clunky and not used in it's complete form.  It's basically the sum of all interactions that could happen, so if you limit yourself to describing just one phenomenon at a time the equation will be much smaller.  And they came up with that simply by gathering all the different interactions and forces that have been discovered over the years and summing them up in one equation.  I'm trying to think of a metaphor, maybe a human could work. Your lagrangian could be L=eat+drink+sleep+talk+walk+...

But much like in the movies, real life isn't a vacuum.   If your looking for a specific person, say a bomb maker, ooooh very action filmy. His name is Bob Aker.  We, just by the reason we are looking for him, automatically have more than just a name. Bob we know makes bombs. Know we have to figure out where bombs are blowing up to get a rough estimate of his Area of Operations. Well that narrows the search down to one country. Canada. Know we know Bob is likely Canadian. So we can either try and investigate every Bob Aker in Canada or we can find other ways to narrow the search. Bomb type or targets or delivery method. And each step narrows the search.   I saw in your comment earlier this was in reference to Brraking Bad. Them having a name was just the last piece they needed. They had an iconic image, but they couldn't just walk around the Southwest or even just New Mexico going after every old dude with a funny hat. But once you have a name and a funny hat.

    "answer": "Feedback can happen at any frequency that's a multiple of the one that matches the time taken for the sound to go from the microphone, through the amplifier etc. come out of the speaker, and reach the microphone again.  If the speaker and microphone are a metre apart (say, between your monitor and a headset mic) then that \"fundamental\" frequency would be 330Hz (sound travels at about 330 metres per second in air) which sounds like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX8KZx5RDg8)  This isn't all that high pitched, but that's where *harmonics* come in!  Any sound at a frequency that's a simple multiple of the main harmonic (e.g. 2x330=660Hz, 3x330=990Hz etc.) will *also* be repeated.  Most usually, the sound that triggers this kind of feedback is a fairly sharp click noise, such as you get when you plug something in. These sounds have *lots* of high frequency components, and any of these that are a multiple of the fundamental will join in the feedback party.  Why do we only hear the high frequencies? Because there are only a couple of \"low\" frequencies that are multiples of that fundamental, and far more at higher frequencies.  Human hearing spans around 20Hz-20KHz, so the feedback would likely include 330, 660, 990, all the way up to 19,800Hz (maybe higher depending on your hearing)  That's a total of around 60 different frequencies, and only the first few would sound \"low\" - the highest ones would be fairly painful to hear at any volume.",

If they say 6 months you have a sucker who can't think outside of very simple frameworks.  People, especially the ones who will tell you they aren't, are not smart and will leave subscriptions active for years after they stop using it.  Subscriptions are a way to make people think they are spending less than they are, and for them to never even know how much they are spending. It exploits ego and ignorance and often emotions.  The super simple answer is because they know they can get more money for the same thing because people look at a monthly price as the total cost even if they understand it isn't. The smaller you can break up a total cost the cheaper it appears. Even if we know that math is a real thing, we don't use it because we're lazy.

    "answer": "My GF was the consultant in charge of the project to explain to parents in CA why the change to Common Core was happening, help them understand the how and why behind what was being done, and to give them the tools to help their children with it.  Common Core was designed with a goal: to significantly increase the number of students graduating high school with the higher math knowledge such as basic Calculus, Trigonometry, etc.  that previously only a small percentage of the students managed during their high school education.  In the process of figuring out how to do this it became apparent that a lot of the traditional way that math concepts were presented and taught starting in Kindergarten and continuing in the primary school years were at best not optimal, and at worst actually counter-productive once students had to make transitions beyond arithmetic. This resulted in the creation of a unified curriculum of study that planned the whole set of goals, grade by grade, and how it was presented with this goal in mind.  They way that initial arithmetic is taught in Kindergarten is done with the goal of making sure that the math is taught not just to get whatever concept is currently being taught into their brains, but to always be focused on what they are going to have to learn down the road and lay the foundation for that.  One thing that stuck in my head while talking to my GF about it was that she noted how it become apparent how important it was to get the parents to understand that Common Core needed to be viewed as a 13 year process starting in Kindergarten and coming to fruition when their child graduated the 12th grade.  The standards were introduced in CA in 2014-15 school year, this means that the first class of students who will graduate having been taught by this method for their entire public school education will be the class of 2028.

    "answer": "your entire body works very hard to try to stay balanced, and the process is more complicated than simply throwing out the bad and keeping the good.    you can think of it as a puzzle where you want everything as even as possible,  but you arent allowed to have any empty slots.  if you want to throw out sodium you need to fill the spot the sodium is in with something else similar enough to fit there.  if you want more calcium you need to try to throw out something in a calcium shaped spot.    while drinking water after ingesting too much sodium helps with short term symptoms such as dehydration or cramps,  it usually does not supply the necessary pieces to fill in the sodium spots when sodium is thrown away. those still need to be taken from elsewhere.    so a large excess of sodium long term heavily taxes the body by causing a loss of other similar nutrients that cant be absorbed since there are no open spots for them, heavily taxes organs like the kidney that are trying to move sodium everyday when it doesnt have enough puzzle pieces to keep up with the consupmtion, and can eventually cause even further unbalances as other puzzle pieces have to be reshuffled to attempt to balance with the sodium.    p.s.  the reason water retains with sodium  is because your body is struggling to find pieces to trade out with the sodium and must keep it.  the water is kept as well to prevent those immediate issues of sodium like dehydration and cramps etc.  but doesnt fix the core issue.    ***tldr having a very high amount of sodium is like playing a game of tetris with a ton of one piece and hardly any of the others.  your body tries to adapt but eventually you end up with more and more pieces on the board that are sodium and no way to get rid of them.  while water can help short term with sodium consumption it doesnt give your body the needed pieces to clear a board full of sodium, and instead fills the board up even more as a piece that glues itself to sodium.***",

There are tons of historical accounts from authors of Greek, Roman, and other origins that are our only insights to history that we work off of, despite knowing that they\u2019re often biased, come from a limited perspective, are imperfectly translated, and are usually dramatized.  Yet when it comes to the Bible, people are very quick to criticize it for the same problems. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me.  Second: I do think there needs to be more to someone\u2019s faith than just what they read in the Bible. It gives us insight to God\u2019s heart, and some guidance/instruction to carry on our way, but it can\u2019t be everything.  If we as Christians believe the Gospel, then we also have to believe God is still active and moving today. We have to live out our faith, and experiencing all that comes with it through our lives.  As a side note to that, I think that might be why some people struggle to understand Christianity. They view us as being entirely rooted to these events from 2000 years ago. What\u2019s missed is that our faith is rooted in *our* experiences.

While people like to compare Jeff Bezos' fortune to the average Amazon worker's salary and say \"inequality as never before\", that's not true.  It you compare the wealth of a 16th century french king to a 16th century peasant, the inequality was much worse in the 16th century.  Since the era of the pyramids (5000 years ago) it's been important for the people on the \"got a lot\" side of inequality to offer some justification for why they have so much more than everybody else.  Religion was invented for this purpose.  Kings were \"God on Earth\", or had \"Divine Right to Rule\".

    "answer": "It's an \"everything else staying the same\" scenario but you're mentally jumping to the next step. The better way to think about it is that the transformer has a constant amount of magnetic flux on both sides. We end up in a bind when we try a harness that flux. The same coil that cuts the lines of flux to create a voltage is also an inductor that will oppose changing current flow. As the coil gets longer, the voltage goes up but the current shrinks due to the extra impedance.",

    "answer": "Art is by definition subjective in its value. A painting can be worth $50 or $50,000 to different people based on how much they like it, unlike goods with a fixed, known price or range of reasonable prices. I can buy a $100,000 painting for $10,000 paid by check and reported, and $90,000 in cash and not reported. I can then sell the painting for $100,000, and I've just converted $90,000 of cash I can't explain into $100,000 that looks legitimate.  Art sales can also be entirely in cash and 100% anonymous. This means I can buy a painting for $500,000 and claim I sold it to someone anonymous for $1,000,000 in order to explain how I got that extra $500,000 dollars and there's really no way to prove otherwise. Now in this scenario, I got that $500,000 from some illegal activity but I'm claiming it's from a perfectly legal art sale, and it's very difficult to prove that it isn't legit. I just very easily turned $500,000 of illegal money into $500,000 of clean money with no paper trail at all as to where that money came from.",

    "question": "ELI5: What does life insurance mean?",
    "answer": "I can help as I have worked in the industry for a while.   The simplest form of life insurance works where an insurance provider will promise to pay a lump sum of money in the event of someone's death. Insurance providers charge a small amount of money for this periodically (the premium) in order to fulfil this promise.   Insurance providers work out how much money to charge by looking at things like life expectancy over large populations of people. They also invest the money they collect. The idea is that they will ultimately collect more money from people that don't die and make more in investment returns from that money than they will have to pay out for people that do die.   Sometimes people have very expensive lives. Think rock stars or football players or business executives. If these people have life insurance and they die, then the insurance provider could lose a lot of money. Instead of turning away the business, insurance providers can lay off some of the risk by getting other insurers to take up a portion of the payment if the high vaule lives were to die. This is called reinsurance.   This answer relates to life (term) insurance, but there are a bunch of other types like trauma, total and permanent disability, income continuity, all of which are offered by life insurance providers. Other products also operate as quasi investment products where even if the insured life doesn't die there is a payout at the end.   Happy to answer any questions about any element of this.",

    "answer": "This is fine or rather said to be done in Star Trek with the Transporters. However those have a super technology that doesn't exist called a Heisenberg Compensator to prevent any data loss.  The reason they need that is because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that states,  Any thing smaller than something on the atomic level and an attempt to measure precisely the velocity of the subatomic particle, such as an\u00a0electron, will knock it about in an unpredictable way, so that a simultaneous measurement of its position has no validity. This result has nothing to do with inadequacies in the measuring instruments, the technique, or the observer; it arises out of the\u00a0intimate\u00a0connection in nature between particles and waves in the realm of subatomic dimensions.  So when you get broken down into subatomic parts,  it's likely this principle if not compensated for will not allow you to ever be assembled again or that everything is sent without any loss.

    "question": "ELI5: Why are electric appliances (e.g. blender, vacuum) so loud, when electric motors are quiet?",
    "answer": "There can be a bunch of different reasons.  First, there are different kinds of motors. \"Brushed\" motors are cheaper, but the way they're put together makes them louder and more likely to break. \"Brushless\" motors are more expensive, quieter, and easier to maintain. But some high-quality appliances use brushless motors and are still loud. Why?  Size and cost are big reasons.   Appliance motors have to be very small and fit in small spaces. They generate a lot of heat and need to pull in air to cool themselves. There's not a lot of room for sound dampening or vibration isolation, and it would make the appliances cost more. Further, a lot of the premium devices are sold based on how much power they have, and people think a louder motor has more power. (They've never thought about how a lawnmower is often louder than a car!) So not a lot of people are really shopping for a *quiet* blender or vacuum, especially if it means they become so large they aren't easy to use or so expensive they aren't worth it.   Car motors, on the other hand, are part of a very expensive purchase. People expect them to be quiet, it's one of their selling points.

Writing it out on a piece of paper like  6  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  2(1+2)  will result in 1, because you ALWAYS do the math of the numerators and denominators first as if they were in parentheses.

    "answer": "If the surface water is contaminated, it's highly likely that the groundwater will also be contaminated; water can seep through the ground, carrying whatever contaminants with it.  Water purification is a lot more complex than water access is. A purification plant will necessary generate waste (whatever contaminant that needs to be removed). Improper storage/processing of the waste risks leaks, which can cause further groundwater contamination. While this won't affect the people who have access to the purified water, it will certainly impact those downstream who don't have access to purified water.  So whatever solution is devised will require either continuous external funding (which most charities will balk at, since they'd basically be signing up to be a utility company) or a self-sustaining local economy (which is hard to develop, either due to little existing economic activity to build off of or geopolitical instability that makes the area unappealing for investment).",

    "question": "ELI5: How is electricity physically measured (like at the meter on my house)?",
    "answer": "Maybe not ELI5, but here you go.  Electricity is the flow of electrons.   Electrons flow because they are pushed by a *voltage*. The voltage is like the pressure causes water to flow in a pipe.  The amount of electrons that flow is termed the *current*. The current is like the flowrate of water in the pipe.  More voltage (pressure) = more current (flow).  So if you want to talk about flow, you might say there are 10 electrons travelling past a point every second (electrons per second), just like how you might talk about water flow in litres or gallons per second.  If you want to find the total volume of water, you take the flow and multiply it by time. So if you had 10 litres per second, after 100 seconds you used 10\u00d7100=1000 litres.  Same for electricity. You take the amperage, and multiply it by time. We could do electrons per second, but we use Amperes to measure current. We also use hours instead of seconds.  So what do you get when you multiply Amperes and Hours? Ampere-hour (Ah), which is what you see on your electricity bill. The ampere-hour is the amount of electricity you used.  Now we know how you measure time, but what about current?  Inside your meter is a *current transformer*. This consists of a metal donut that surrounds the main conductor going into your house. A copper wire is coiled around the donut.  The electricity going through the main conductor is AC (*alternating current*). Now when electricity flows, it creates a magnetic field. When that current *alternates*, so does the magnetic field. So you have an *alternating magnetic field* surrounding the main conductor. This fluctuating magnetic field causes magnetic field lines to pass through that copper coil in your little current transformer, and that *induces* a small current in the copper coil.  This copper coil is connected to a smarter device which includes an ammeter which measures the current. This is then used to calculate the current in the main conductor.  The current \u00d7 time calculation is done at small intervals and added together to account for varying loads.",

    "question": "eli5: What is the intrinsic value of crypto, what will protect it from banks tanking it in their backing, and how is it more than just a literal gamble?",
    "answer": "The value in crypto is because other people value it, and use it as a means of exchange. That's basically it.  Every currency is underpinned by the market it has exclusivity in. For example, people often say the US dollar is not backed in anything, but that's not strictly true. It's backed by the US economy, and the fact that in order to play in the US economy you must use dollars, and you must pay your taxes in dollars. Due to the sheer size of the US economy, the dollar is so powerful that it's used as the de-facto means of exchange worldwide, hence why 90-95% of *all* international trade uses dollars, either directly or indirectly as an intermediate currency (most of that remaining 5-10% are Euros for inter-EU trade, and then Yen which is largely in lockstep with the US Dollar).  For crypto, that market is (at the moment) mainly illicit items that can't really be purchased in real-world currencies because the governments that issue those currencies are the ones who define those items as being illicit in the first place.  However, that's also fundamentally what will likely by the undoing of crypto, at least as we know it. Currently, crypto has a very short list of primary uses ranging the full spectrum of illicit activities, from relatively harmless activities like buying marijuana or pirated music to extremely harmful activities like buying child pornography. But the really two big problems crypto has are due to it's association with money laundering and avoiding economic sanctions, and as a result there's a reason why something on the order of 90% of crypto mining is done in China, Russia, Iran, and Venezuela.  Further, should the United States choose to do so, it can pretty easily swat crypto down, as the US government can effectively ban any party from exchanging dollars for crypto, either directly or indirectly, as is shown by sanctions against existing governments. The only reason crypto hasn't been hit *yet* is essentially because it's beneath the notice of Congress and the White House, but it'll only take a single high-profile case facilitated by crypto exchange for the US government to go to town on crypto markets, at which point the value will tank because crypto's already poor liquidity will be effectively frozen. For an example; just think of what happens if/when there is a major terrorist attack in a western country paid for in Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever. The US government *already* locked down on air travel in the wake of 9/11, despite complaints that persist to this day. Just think of what the US government will do when the only people who suffer are seen in the popular zeitgeist as terrorists, kiddy-diddlers, and drug dealers.  In essence; crypto is neither an investment or a store of value. It is a flash in the pan, and a means of short term speculation, but while the technology is neat (and will probably be used legitimately in the future), the current coins are all at the mercy of powerful governmental agencies, and will only survive (and maintain value) so long as they fly under the radar.",

You can add them all as a cluster on the end and make them invisible or almost invisible. You may notice web pages often have a bunch of different keywords at the end linking to pages showing other articles with the same keywords.

    "answer": "Let's say you have a game that has objects. Well you generally don't want your objects passing through each other so you want the game to detect when two objects have \"collided\" so you can have them do things like explode or bounce off of each other. So you write some code for this \"collision detection.\"  Well, just about every game in the world has objects for which we need to detect collisions. So rather than every game studio in the world independently coming up with their own collision detection code from scratch, I'm just going to sell them mine. Saves them time and makes me money.  But just doing collusion detection wouldn't be efficient. So we add in just about all the stuff that's common to all games, or all games of a certain genre. Like applying gravity to objects, code for rending objects into the images you see on the screen, determining line of sight, etc. etc.  Take all of those common and ubiquitous functions that are applicable to lots of different games and package it up and now you have a game engine.  Now, buying a prepackaged game engine isn't *necessary* in the sense that you can still build a game without one, but in the end you'd just have to code all that stuff yourself anyway (basically building your own \"game engine\" piece by piece). Now if you want to build a game and not go insane doing it, and also maybe do it within your life time and to make a profit, then yes, using established game engines is pretty much a necessity.

Eastern Rome was having enormous difficulties as well, with great depopulation and Slavic invasions.  **North Africa and Southern Hispania** came under the rule of the Islamic Caliphate, which was **centuries ahead in development compared to the rest of Europe**.  Both Roman Architecture and Islamic Architecture were base on Persian architecture (not Greek, except as decoration) and while in the West slowed, in Islam flourished.  With the start of the Renaissance a trend of imitating and studying old Rome became fashionable, often studying translations or original Classical books collected by Islamic scholars, plenty in Cordoba.  Now, the fact that the centers of development transfer to Europe is another story, but the Neoclassical is a companion to modernity and it's a fabrication of a supposed heritage. For most of history Europe was a left-over of the centers of knowledge of Al-Andalus, the Maghreb, and the Levant. Most similarities with Rome are later additions to make ourselves heirs of that.

Suppose I am a fruit seller, and I sell apples, oranges and pears, but not peaches.  Late in the afternoon, I have sold all of my apples, but still have a few oranges and pears left.  A guy comes up to me and asks me what I sell.  I tell him I have oranges and pears.  The guy tells me he wants to buy apples and peaches.  I explain to him that although I have neither apples nor peaches right now, I do sell apples, and if he comes back tomorrow I will have some apples for sale, but I never sell peaches.  I decide rather than having to explain this to every customer I will have a sign that tells people what I have available to buy, so the next day I have a blackboard in front of my stall and write apples: 15, oranges: 23, pears: 17.  As the day goes on, and I sell my fruit, I change the numbers so that as I sell the fruit, people passing by know what I have left to buy.  At some point I sell my last apple.  I want to be able to indicate that although I don't have any apples right now, I do sell them, and if they come back tomorrow I will have some more, but I want to make that distinct from the fact that I do not sell peaches.  If I can write apples: 0, oranges: 5, pears: 3, it says something different from saying oranges: 5, pears: 3, because it indicates that although I have no apples right now, I still do sell apples.

This is a mathematical technique which lets us look at a wave, let's say the sound of a lion's roar, and instead of looking at how it changes over time (like having a loud beginning, slowly getting quieter, and a few grumbles at the end), asking what other waves it is made of.  That feels like a big jump, but it's simpler than you think. Sticking with sound, you may know that the pitch of a sound is determined by something called it's frequency. This is mostly true, but it's not the full picture. Sounds are made up of lots and lots of frequencies all added together. This is what makes a violin sound different to a flute if they're playing the same note. What this means is that if you take a very simple wave which genuinely only has a single frequency, called a sine wave, and start adding very special amounts of other waves of very specific frequencies, you can actually build sounds from scratch - this is called \"additive synthesis\", by the way.  What the Fast Fourier Transform does is tell you exactly what amount of *all* frequencies have gone into making whatever wave it's looking at. This is sometimes called a \"decomposition\", because it is looking at what the wave is composed of.  Why is it associated with ghost hunters?

    "answer": "Let me try and explain the European club football pyramid:  First, the most important point: All professional football teams in Europe play under the same umbrella, that is called UEFA. UEFA runs the highest club competition in Europe, called the UEFA Champions League, whose winner is the European champion. The teams that will play in any given year's Champions League are the previous year's winners of the national leagues of European nations.  Oh, yes, the national leagues: Parallel to the Champions League, every nation also has its own leagues. England has its own, called the Premier League, my country Turkey has the S\u00fcper Lig, etc. The qualification process varies by country depending on that country's teams' previous performance, but by winning the national league, any team in any given European country could go and get to play in the Champions League, and win it and become the European champions if they are good enough.  Each nation has lower divisions of their leagues too, but those divisions are all interconnected with the top division. At the end of each season, the top teams in lower divisions switch places with the bottom teams in the higher division, a process known as 'promotion and relegation'. This ensures that, if I and a bunch of my friends decided to form a team in our Turkish town tomorrow, after enough victories in the following years, we could theoretically get promoted to the Turkish S\u00fcper Lig, win that, go to the Champions League, win that, and become the European champions. Improbable, sure, but theoretically not impossible. By winning enough games for a long enough time, any team could win the Champions League.  Every other continent also has a similar system to determine their continental champion. Every year, the winners from all 6 continents play in the  FIFA Club World Cup. The winner is crowned the world champion.  Now these 12 rich teams owned by bastards have decided to bypass this whole system by creating their own league in place of the Champions League. They seem to like the American system of 'closed league', where the owners of teams decide who gets to play, where even after years of horrendous performance you just continue to be part of the competition, where new teams (which are referred to as 'franchises', ugh) have to ask for permission from the league to be part of it.  This would make the entirety of European leagues pointless. Sure, the national leagues would continue to exist, but with no way of joining this 'Super League' besides invitation, and no way for the 'founding clubs' to ever not qualify for it, pretty much all the excitement of European football is being stolen.",

Then, you take an antibody against the HA tag which binds it tightly, and you stick a coating of that antibody to tiny sand-sized plastic beads. You put those beads into a column, and run your protein soup through it. Your YFG-HA protein sticks to the antibodies on the beads while everything else runs through.

    "answer": "Freedom of speech does have certain limitations in particular inciting violence or threat. Its illegal to threaten to kill someone but remember that its that call to arms that's illegal. The words \"I'm going to kill you\" is not illegal because you can say it sarcastically, as a quote, or as an example as I just did. However, if you say \"I'm going to kill you\" then include a date, time, how you plan on doing it, etc then it becomes illegal.  Similarly, the argument for freedom of speech cannot be used to defend illegal market manipulation, fraud, insider trading, etc. It is the action that is illegal not the words. Market manipulation is illegal because only a few can benefit from it. In your example Warren Buffet says \"you should buy company X's stock\" so a bunch of people buy it and increase the stock value and then Warren could pull all of his money out and make a ton of money but plummeting the stock price. That would effectively be stealing from the company and the people he told to buy the stock.  Pump and dump like that is very different than typical stock increases because it is not based on an intrinsic value. It is only increasing in value due to a perceived demand based on stock sales but has no relevance to the performance of the company. And while the process of buy low sell high in a short term is not illegal it brings a lot more risk to the table and not really considered \"investing\" but more betting/gambling on the stock market.",

    "answer": "The error was introduced by Dionysius Exiguus in the year of 525. He did not give any background for his calculations but he calculated back to when he thought Jesus was born and then based his easter calendar on that. Previous calendars used the name of the roman consuls for that year or the name of the emperor or other regant. Dionysius did not want to publish a Christian calendar using the names of all the tyrants so he used the year of our lord instead. Part of the reason this became popular and not just in Christian circles was that the Roman Empire was pretty much on its last leg at that point and everyone had started to name the years after whatever local ruler might happen to name themselves king at that moment which made it hard to use calendars across boarders.",

    "answer": "There are actually many genes involved in balding, some connected to the x chromosome and some the y. The main baldness  gene is found to be on the maternal x chromosome. So if you are male, you inherited your x chromosome from your mom. So the likelihood of you becoming bald is fairly high if your mom's dad was bald. But remember your mom has two x chromosomes so she may not have passed on the gene to her male child.  The male child may have gotten the mom's x chromosome that doesn't carry the gene. So just because your mom's dad is bald doesn't mean you will be but your chances are higher. Now if your y chromosome,  which you get from your dad, carries one of those other baldness genes NOT related to the x chromosome,  you still have a chance of being bald even if you did not inherit your mother's chromosome that has the main baldness gene. So, If your maternal grandfather is bald you have a high likelihood of going bald. If your dad is bald too, you have an even higher chance of being bald because he may be bald due to a gene on his Y chromosome that causes baldness.",

    "answer": "Let's say you have a game that has objects. Well you generally don't want your objects passing through each other so you want the game to detect when two objects have \"collided\" so you can have them do things like explode or bounce off of each other. So you write some code for this \"collision detection.\"  Well, just about every game in the world has objects for which we need to detect collisions. So rather than every game studio in the world independently coming up with their own collision detection code from scratch, I'm just going to sell them mine. Saves them time and makes me money.  But just doing collusion detection wouldn't be efficient. So we add in just about all the stuff that's common to all games, or all games of a certain genre. Like applying gravity to objects, code for rending objects into the images you see on the screen, determining line of sight, etc. etc.  Take all of those common and ubiquitous functions that are applicable to lots of different games and package it up and now you have a game engine.  Now, buying a prepackaged game engine isn't *necessary* in the sense that you can still build a game without one, but in the end you'd just have to code all that stuff yourself anyway (basically building your own \"game engine\" piece by piece). Now if you want to build a game and not go insane doing it, and also maybe do it within your life time and to make a profit, then yes, using established game engines is pretty much a necessity.  There are many different game engines for two main reasons:  1. Some game engines are tailored for specific kind of genres. A game engine tailored for racing games will include different kinds of code than a game engine tailored for side scrollers or one tailored for first-person shooters. 2. People have different ideas of what kinds of functions or capabilities should be included in a game engine or how those functions or capabilities should be written in code.",

    "question": "ELI5: What's the source of light scientists talk about?",
    "answer": "The speed of light is quite poorly named, to be honest.  Think of it more as the speed of reality.  If I make a change to the universe HERE you will see that change happen when that reality - moving at \"the speed of light\" - reaches you.  It doesn't matter if that change is a physical object, a light beam, gravitational pull, radio waves, whatever... the \"reality\" of it having changed moves outwards from that event at the speed of light.  If you were 1 light-year away, and I turned on a torch, you won't see that torch turn on until my reality expands out to meet yours, which will take a year.  If you were 1 light-year away, and I died, you couldn't ever possibly know that I'd died until the reality of my death has expanded so far that it touches your reality.  There's no way to \"cheat\" it by sending a message announcing my death ahead, it would only ever reach you at the speed that the reality of the event expands.  If the sun disappeared into nothingness this instant, being 8 light-minutes away, it would take 8 minutes before Earth suddenly WASN'T being pulled by the Sun, and stopped orbiting.  We wouldn't know the Sun had gone optically for those 8 minutes either.  Those 8 minutes are how long whatever-is-happening on the Sun takes to reach the part of the solar-system we live in.  This is why when we look back at stars, we can say that a star is as it appeared a million years ago, etc.  We know that because they are a million light-years away.  Hence the \"reality\" of whatever happened to that star hasn't reached us until a million years later.  That star is probably long dead and gone.  The speed of light is the speed of reality.  It's really the speed limit of the entire universe because of that.  NOTHING can go faster than reality itself, but reality isn't instantaneously everywhere.  It takes a while for the reality to catch up and expand out because the distances are so vast.  If you \\*could\\* go faster than the speed of light, you could actually get somewhere, and then look back and watch yourself leave on that journey.  And the \"you\" that left would have been able to see the \"you\" that's already there, before you leave!  It basically turns almost into time travel, which is paradoxical and therefore we believe it's just not possible to do.  You would be able to send a radio message to yourself in the past, and things like that, and we don't think that's \"allowed\" in physics without everything breaking.  The speed of light is just called the speed of light, light is just an incidental example of it.  Think of it as the speed of \"reality\" and it starts to make much more sense.  Around a black hole, for instance, gravity has so curved space and time that the reality of whatever happens inside the black hole cannot ever make it out the black hole.  Hence we know nothing about what happens inside a black hole and anyone inside of one knows nothing about what happens outside.  It basically \"chops\" the realities in two, and they never meet again.",

    "question": "ELI5 \u201cHot Hands\u201d or other hand warmers - how do they work/ how are they safe?",
    "answer": "There are different types, but one uses sodium acetate dissolved in water. It's a super-saturated solution, meaning that really there is more stuff dissolved in the water than the water would \"like\". So the sodium acetates \"wants\" to start come out of solution and form solid crystals. To start growing a crystal, though, you need a *nucleation site*, some little bit of something that the first sodium acetate molecules can latch onto and then gather into a crystal from there. Without a nucleation site, the sodium acetate stays in its super-saturated solution.  The hand warmer packet contains this solution along with a little strip of metal. If you bend this strip, little bits of metal come off and these provide nucleation sites for the crystals to start growing. This crystallization process is an *exothermic*, i.e. heat-releasing, reaction.  How did the heat get there? Well, to create a super-saturated solution, you need to dissolve the sodium acetate in hot water (which can hold more stuff in solution) and then let it cool. Some of the heat you put in gets stored in the solution - the heat that was necessary to get it super-saturated (in other words, the solution reaction was *endothermic*). When the excess sodium acetate crystallizes, the heat energy stored in the solution is released.  As to why it is safe, you can calculate how much heat energy will be released and thus how  hot the hand warmer will get. So you can ensure that the temperature will be in a safe range. There's no danger of a \"runaway\" reaction since you know exactly how much sodium acetate you dissolved and how much solution you put in the packet.",

This is usually a result of the sheerer not being carefull enough and doing many mistakes, possibly because they are working too fast. Depending on the animal wellfare legislation this may be illegal.  The combs are pointy because they need to go through the thick wool easily. If the combs are sharp then they will get stuck in the wool instead of seperating it. When the combs get stuck it is much easier to cause wounds to the sheep either by ripping out pieces of wool while the skin is still attached or by loosing control of the sheers and pushing them into the skin. So in order to avoid this the combs are kept sharp to go thorugh the wool without effort and with full control.

In Maxwell's equations, the vacuum speed of light just always equal to c.  This means that regardless of the source, whether it a lamp, or a moving car, or the Sun, or a spaceship flying towards me, I will always measure the speed of light from any of these sources to be c.  Turning that around, it also means that if I ever try to accelerate myself even faster, I will still _always_ measure the speed of my headlights to be c, which is why you can never accelerate faster than the speed of light.

    "answer": "We have laser engravers at my place of work, engraving and cutting out articles from sheet acrylic.  Yes, it can be more efficient to have the laser engraver begin at one corner of the sheet and work its way over to the other corner. Sometimes the drawing file (we make ours up in Corel Draw) can be optimized to encourage this. Sometimes, no matter what order you put the elements into the file, the laser engraver will etch one part of the sheet sooner than the part of the sheet you intended. Getting the file to \u201cdraw\u201d as quickly as possible involves some trial and error.  We also divide our drawings into three different color layers, which will be processed in this order: red, green, blue.  Red: anything that needs to be *rastered* will be in the red layer. The \u201cprint head\u201d of the laser engraver will zip back-and-forth rapidly firing the laser beam intermittently at low power to draw a bit of artwork, such as a company logo, on the plastic. The effect is like watching a black-and-white television picture being built up line-by-line.  Green: any thing that needs to be *vectored* is in this layer. Straight and curved lines are best drawn by keeping the laser beam on, but at low power, for the duration of each line being drawn. The \u201cprint head\u201d of the engraver will proceed in a smooth motion, along both the X and Y axes as needed to engrave each line.  Blue: all lines to be cut entirely through the acrylic sheet are in the blue layer. Moving the \u201cprint head\u201d around works just as it does in the green layer: smooth motions in both the X and Y axes as needed. But this time, the laser is firing a continuous beam for each cut that is at or nearly at full power. An air assist (either compressed air supplied by the building\u2019s compressor, or the laser engraver\u2019s built-in compressor) will be blowing continually to discourage a fire.

    "question": "ELI5 Why do Laser engravers jump around when etching a design into an object? Wouldn\u2019t it be more efficient to engrave top to bottom or side to side like a typical printer?",
    "answer": "We have laser engravers at my place of work, engraving and cutting out articles from sheet acrylic.  Yes, it can be more efficient to have the laser engraver begin at one corner of the sheet and work its way over to the other corner. Sometimes the drawing file (we make ours up in Corel Draw) can be optimized to encourage this. Sometimes, no matter what order you put the elements into the file, the laser engraver will etch one part of the sheet sooner than the part of the sheet you intended. Getting the file to \u201cdraw\u201d as quickly as possible involves some trial and error.  We also divide our drawings into three different color layers, which will be processed in this order: red, green, blue.  Red: anything that needs to be *rastered* will be in the red layer. The \u201cprint head\u201d of the laser engraver will zip back-and-forth rapidly firing the laser beam intermittently at low power to draw a bit of artwork, such as a company logo, on the plastic. The effect is like watching a black-and-white television picture being built up line-by-line.  Green: any thing that needs to be *vectored* is in this layer. Straight and curved lines are best drawn by keeping the laser beam on, but at low power, for the duration of each line being drawn. The \u201cprint head\u201d of the engraver will proceed in a smooth motion, along both the X and Y axes as needed to engrave each line.  Blue: all lines to be cut entirely through the acrylic sheet are in the blue layer. Moving the \u201cprint head\u201d around works just as it does in the green layer: smooth motions in both the X and Y axes as needed. But this time, the laser is firing a continuous beam for each cut that is at or nearly at full power. An air assist (either compressed air supplied by the building\u2019s compressor, or the laser engraver\u2019s built-in compressor) will be blowing continually to discourage a fire. Acrylic doesn\u2019t burn well, particularly if a constant stream of air is blowing out what flames do occur.",

What you don't see is the types of sunlight that our eyes can't pick up on. One of these types of light that we can't see is ultra-violet, and it has a fair amount of energy in it. So when it hits your skin and you don't have any protection, over time, that energy kinda wrecks important and complex stuff that makes up your cells  (in sort of the same way a fire that's too close burns your skin). The ultraviolet light damages the cells that make up your living skin, and causes them to turn red or blister or peel.  Sunscreen is like a wall that doesn't let quite as much of that invisible, damaging light through. Apply it and it dries into a sort of invisible armor that our eyes can't see... but that ultraviolet light (which our eyes also can't see) can't get through.

This is a mathematical technique which lets us look at a wave, let's say the sound of a lion's roar, and instead of looking at how it changes over time (like having a loud beginning, slowly getting quieter, and a few grumbles at the end), asking what other waves it is made of.  That feels like a big jump, but it's simpler than you think. Sticking with sound, you may know that the pitch of a sound is determined by something called it's frequency. This is mostly true, but it's not the full picture. Sounds are made up of lots and lots of frequencies all added together. This is what makes a violin sound different to a flute if they're playing the same note. What this means is that if you take a very simple wave which genuinely only has a single frequency, called a sine wave, and start adding very special amounts of other waves of very specific frequencies, you can actually build sounds from scratch - this is called \"additive synthesis\", by the way.  What the Fast Fourier Transform does is tell you exactly what amount of *all* frequencies have gone into making whatever wave it's looking at. This is sometimes called a \"decomposition\", because it is looking at what the wave is composed of.  Why is it associated with ghost hunters?

The sample rate and bit depth of an audio signal will dictate how perfectly the digital waveform will match the analog one. Say for example, you have a pure sine wave running into a recording interface. This gets converted by an ADC into a digital version. If your sample rate is really bad, it will end up looking like a square wave, or a kind of stepped triangle wave. If its good, it will be really close to a sine wave. Then digital filters can be used to smooth all the sharp edges and make it a nice round wave again.  The sample rate being 2x your sound frequency is the nyquist theorem. It has nothing to do with doubling the frequencies you are hearing or playing back within the audio itself; what it means is if you are only interested in the audio range (up to \\~20kHz), you need at least a 40kHz sample rate to not get any aliasing or artifacts.

No literally, moisturizing soaps generally use glycerine (also called glycerol) as the moisturizing agent and it leaves a film on your skin which both traps moisture evaporating from your skin and attracts moisture from the air being an hygroscopic chemical.  &#x200B;  Further simplifying, in the soap formulation there is a chemical that both keeps moisture in and pulls moisture from air so your skin remains moist.  &#x200B;  (It's the same reason why sanitizing gel has it, if you used only 70% alcohol your skin would dry really fast but the glycerine that remains on your skin combats that effect and protects your skin)",

Wires give off a small magnetic field when electricity runs through them. You can use this magnetic field to basically cause the reverse to happen.

    "answer": "A naked short is an illegal practice in which an institution borrows a share of a stock and shorts it, except the share has not been determined to exist.   For example, say there are 1 million shares of a company. A normal short would be borrowing 100 shares and paying a premium to open a contract giving you the right to sell those shares at a price (the strike price) regardless of what the price is. This means if the stock goes down you can sell it for more than its worth. A naked short, is borrowing shares that aren\u2019t determined to exist. This means if there are 1 million shares, and someone\u2019s buys short contracts worth more shares than what exist in the market, it\u2019s artificial.   This is illegal because it creates an artificial market with non existent shares and mostly undermines the whole system. However this is a common practice by many financial institutions such as hedge funds (citadel for example).   As for what happened on CNBC, an anchor woman actually called what the current hedge funds and market participants naked shorting, in reference to AMC and GameStop stock. This is significant because naked shorting is illegal. So a trusted financial news source like CNBC on air saying it\u2019s naked shorting is validating the reason why many people are buying and holding shares of company\u2019s like AMC and GameStop.

    "answer": "Any system have angular momentum, around a pivot of choice. Spin is just angular momentum of a particle when considered alone.  Angular momentum are *not* the L=r x v from classical Newtonian mechanics. Instead, we define angular momentum by their main defining characteristic: it is preserved under all continuous rotations. The classical Newtonian angular momentum is a formula that give you a preserved quantity, assuming Newtonian physics is correct. But once we move into the weirder realm of quantum mechanics, we have to abandon the formula and stick with the most important property, the fact that it's preserved under continuous rotations.  Given an arbitrary axis (this axis is normally named z), we can talk about angular momentum around this axis. This is a measurable number that is preserved under all continuous rotations around that axis. Due to funky issue with quantum physics, you can't actually talk about angular momentum around all axis at the same time, because trying to measure this number around one axis disrupt the rest; in fact it's not even possible to talk angular momentum about 2 axes at the same time. However, you can talk about magnitude squared of total angular momentum (when you consider rotation around ALL axis), which IS a number that can be measured.  Without loss of generality, we can assume that we do have a special z-axis where angular momentum exist, because this allows us to have an additional number to identify an electron: the secondary spin number.  If you consider one single particle by itself, this angular momentum give you the spin number, and the angular momentum around one specific z-axis give you the secondary spin number. For an electron, the spin number is fixed to be 1/2, so really you only care about secondary spin number. If you assume that there exist angular momentum around the z-axis, this 1/2 spin number - which tell you angular momentum - limit the possible value of angular momentum around the z-axis. By choosing 1 direction to be called \"up\" (associated with positive number) and the other direction \"down\", we have 2 values +1/2 and -1/2. But warning: this \"up\" and \"down\" don't have any actual geometric meaning, they are merely analogy from classical Newtonian mechanics where angular momentum is represented by a vector that can actually point up or down.  When you consider an atom together with an electron, the whole system itself have a different number that are also angular momentum (of the system). This is called total angular momentum. The electron, when considered alone, have its own angular momentum which is called spin. Subtracting the spin number from the total angular momentum give you orbital angular momentum. Since electron all have the same spin number, you only need orbital angular momentum and secondary spin number if you want to distinguish electrons by angular momentum.",

A grow light (Metal hylide or hi pressure sodium) is burning a chamber of sodium or another element that reacts to being charged and casts radiation and \"full spectrum\" light which just means its not focused on a single light frequency to save energy.. Its pusing multiple light frequencies from far red to UV, this better emulates natural light and has increased PPFD.  A light chart will show this as peaks and valley in the color spectum and the sudden spikes in the IR/ high red or UV/ high blues..  CMH (compact metal hylide) is just that, a smaller hps or mh bulb that typically runs on less wattage but still delivers a full light spectrum.  LED is the new kid on the block.. Older technology was focuses on reds and blues (we call them blurple lights) , sometimes others colors are included but its still not \"full spectrum\" but an imitation... These cast light using a diode which is like a light bulb but super tiny.. Weve all seen these, the strip led's you can get on a real are just small single color diodes..  Newer LED's (Like HLG, Mars Hydro) have started using multiple types of diode as well as more densly packed units which cast more natural white light and offer an actual full spectrum..

Maybe if you had one or more particles in something like a bulb, which was/were quantumly entangled with particles some distance from that bulb -- like forming a sphere x units away from the bulb in all directions -- that those particles, because quantumly entangled with the bulb particles, could attract photons away from the bulb, producing a sphere of blackness.  I don't know if that quite counts as the bulb repelling light. The bulb \"tells\" the entangled particles what to do, and that \"what to do\" is \"pull [get] these photons away from me,\" so maybe?  Fundamentally I think the problem is that darkness is the absence of light, and light isn't the absence of darkness (except experientially). It's very much like conceiving of the hot and the cold.

Allergies are a consequence of your immune system encountering substances (often proteins, though not exclusively), that it identifies as harmful. It\u2019s a normal part of the immune system\u2019s function to detect and react to foreign substances - that\u2019s how it fights off infections by bacteria, viruses and parasites.

If there is a blue sunrise that, to me, as a weather forecaster tells me I have low pressure to my east. The storm has passed.   As a result of low pressure being to my east, I will have high pressure to my west. High pressure is associated with good weather and great conditions. The high pressure is to come and move over my station.   High pressure brings about a low sun angle because it condenses the atmosphere. This low sun angle gives us our red sunrises and sunsets.  Edit: This is more of a mid latitude United States phenomenon. I decided to give it another shot\u2014 see below  Sun rises in the east and sets in the west.    Cool.   If at any point the sun rise or sun set is the color orange, red, or pink it can be inferred that the atmosphere is being condensed under the influence of high pressure. Because the sun is low in the sky and the atmosphere is condensed this is used to locate where high pressure is. Whether it is departing or arriving to you.   On the other hand, low pressure within the atmosphere allows it to expand. Therefore, wherever low pressure is located the sky at sun rise and sun set will not appear the colors aforementioned but will be your usual blue sky. This is due to the lack of condensation in the atmosphere. It allows the blue to be seen instead of the other colors on the visible spectrum.   In the mid latitudes (not the equator or the poles) between 60 degrees N and 30 degrees N there is the polar front jet (jet stream) that is high in the sky and it helps high pressure and low pressure move across mid latitudes in a west to east fashion as this is the only way the wind travels in the polar front jet. So this is the way low pressure systems (more commonly frontal boundaries) move with high pressure ahead and behind the fronts.   Weather is fluid and ever changing.

It's the kind of thing that you are going to loose customers over. And with them, income.

That takes a couple of years.   2.) You can think of memories as being part of a giant \u201cweb\u201d of neurons in the brain. You are able to retrieve a memory as long as the strings connected to that memory are intact. When we\u2019re little, our brains grow *a lot*. New connections are constantly being formed, and many of those connections disrupt the parts of the web of memories that has already formed. And once the old connection is broken, it becomes very difficult to access those memories.   3.) The last reason is just that we don\u2019t know *what* we\u2019re supposed to remember. Absolutely everything is new and everything *feels* big and important. But even as adults, there\u2019s a limit to how much we can process at once...so we usually get rid of the stuff that\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter as much to make room for the important memories.

    "answer": "The whites of your eyes have little to do with what you actually see. The pupil of your eyes is responsible for receiving light and transmitting it to the brain to be perceived as vision.  Squinting changes the angle of the lens of your eye overlying the pupil, causing light to be refracted differently to certain areas inside of your eye, some of which are better at detecting brightness of light, while others are better at detecting color and overall acuity (sharpness) of an image.   If you wear glasses for nearsightedness (trouble with distance vision), you can actually improve your distance vision slightly through squinting -- it bends the light in a way that partially corrects the lens abnormality in nearsightedness. If you only have a mild case of nearsightedness, squinting can almost correct it entirely (but will cause eye strain and other issues doing it all the time).

So, when you use an application that uses server-client model, the connection between you and the host is the same as the connections you make with P2P applications. The difference between server-client and P2P, is that on a server-client, the application will try to connect with a central server (that generally runs another appliciation dedicated to answer the requests of the client), while on a P2P, the application doesn't have a central server (there's the hybrid architeture, as well), and the application can act both as a server and as a client.     A) Yes   B) The same way you connect to any site, like reddit.    C) You need to download the torrent file. That file contains the metadata so the torrent application knows where to find seeders, and how the file is structured.    D) I think you are imagining that P2P is like a literal direct connection between your computer and the other person's computer. Any data that you send over the internet will go through many servers until it reaches the destination, \"direct connection\" doesn't mean the data will go from your computer, and only travel by cable without passing by any routers, and servers, it only means that users exchange data between each other, instead of them sending requests to a central server.     A good analogy is thinking of sending a note in class to your friend on the other side of the room.     P2P is when you pass the note to the person next to you, and ask him to pass the note to your friend on the other side of the room. Each person will pass the note to the next person until it reaches your friend.   Client-Server would be the same situation, but imagine that there's a 3rd friend, and for some reason you need him to read the note, and then send the note to the friend on the other side of the room.

Even other human land uses such as roofs is a bigger issue. And things like planting trees contribute far more to global warming due to darkening of areas then a few asphalt roads do.  In addition asphalt tends to be dark only when freshly laid. After some use the dark binder on the top wear off leaving only the agregate visible which tends to be of a lighter local stone. It have even been common for workers to put down a layer of pure agregate as a top layer when laying asphalt in order to both save costs and reduce environmental impact. This produces a lighter color rougher surface like if the asphalt was already worn. Local businesses does also ask to use lighter rocks for agregate if heat is an issue when laying asphalt for parking spaces and sidewalks.  Paint would be one of the worst thing to do. Firstly the reason we use asphalt is because of its high friction which is required to allow cars to go at high speeds without sliding out of control. Paint have much lower friction and can therefore only be used sparingly. This is why you should avoid driving on the road markings. Secondly paint is far less durable then asphalt. Dust from asphalt is already a huge issue in cities and adding a lot of plastic dust from the paint wearing off is not the best way to solve the issue of global warming.  Of course the best option of all is if we can all stop driving cars and instead use public transport. Especially railed transport is a much better technical solution to moving around with the least environmental impact.",

    "answer": "Some people are better at memorising than others. Also, some people are better at reading sheet music than others. Personally, I find it much easier to read sheet music quickly than to memorise pieces.  Some classical musicians absolutely can memorise long and complicated pieces of music. However, it can be useful to have the sheet music in front of you just in case, even if you don't need to read it. For many classical musicians, the sheet music acts more like a quick memory jogger to remember what the next section is, so that you can then pour your effort into playing that as expressively as necessary.  There are definitely some instruments that are more difficult than others, but this can be for a variety of reasons. As a flautist, I can only play one note at a time, so it's arguably a much simpler instrument than piano or any stringed instrument. At the same time, I don't have as much option for relying on muscle memory. On the piano, you can get used to the way your hands move to play a phrase, and the same for guitar - but on the flute, there's not the same \"easy\" muscle memory for being able to play the next phrase without thinking about. (I'm sure a better flautist than I am might disagree with me about this, but I struggled with the muscle memory for playing phrases on the flute much more than I ever did with the keyboard, guitar, or drums.) As a result, the sheet music can be quite helpful as an aid when the muscle memory isn't as well developed for playing a piece.  Finally, it might just be down to convention and habit. Classical musicians almost always have their sheet music handy, so they almost always put it in front of them. Guitarists often practise without sheet music, so they don't feel as much need to put it in front of them.",

    "question": "ELI5: What exactly is \"Sunk Cost\"?",
    "answer": "\"Sunk cost fallacy\" is a common term, and probably where one of you heard the term for it to enter the conversation.  It refers to the thought process of \"I already spent some money on this. It would be a shame if I stopped spending money on it now.\" In other words, throwing \"good money after bad money.\"  You could imagine the fallacy as \"I bought a boat for $100, but then it sunk in the river. Because I don't want my $100 to be wasted, I'm going to rent a truck for $50 to pull it out. If that truck sinks into the mud, then I'll buy a different truck for $75 so that my $150 isn't wasted.\" The pattern then repeats.  In your specific conversation, the fact that you bought the investment means it is indeed a \"sunk cost\"; the fact that you aren't getting the same money back means it is sunk. If you spend more money on the investment just because you have the investment and are hoping it pays off, you are probably doing a \"sunk cost fallacy\". As a term it is entirely different from profit.  Most times, things that \"can be considered for profit\" use buzzwords and emotions to make people feel better about spending money, and thus spend more money.",

Notably, they survive today as birds. Why didn't birds, then, become \"dominant?\"  This begs the question of what it means to be \"dominant.\" More often than not, humans define \"dominant\" by the traits humans happen to have (tool use, cooperation, intelligence, technology, ability to manipulate our environment). But that's just circular. There are a number of ways in which we *aren't* dominant:  Live on earth for the longest duration? Cyanobacteria.  Total biomass? Antarctic krill.  Longevity? Plenty of species are biologically immortal.  Biggest impact on the environment? Maybe humans, historically, probably cyanobacteria again.  Even the manner in which we divide up living organisms into species is based on manmade constructs. In reality, nature doesn't quite conform to the nice discrete boxes we have made for it.  Setting aside the question of human's dominance, it's probably less contentious to say that mammals in general saw quite a degree of success (success being measured by reproductive success and the explosion of new species and areas occupied) following the fall of the dinosaurs and we can attribute that to a number of reasons:  * Being small and fur-covered, mammals are better adapted to cooler climates, and the earth entered a cooling period after the extinction of the dinosaurs. * The elimination of many large dinosaur species created power vacuums that mammals filled. * Process of elimination.

    "question": "eli5 How do internal combustion engines work?",
    "answer": "I'd google this to get a picture displaying it, helps to be able to visualize it. Also easier to think about one piston of a four stroke engine.   The crankshaft turns, pulling the connecting rod and piston down the cylinder and the valves on the intake side, fresh air open. The piston moving down the cylinder pulls air into the cylinder.   At the bottom of stroke, the intake valves close, and the piston moves up the cylinder compressing the air it pulled in. In a gas engine the file is sprayed or diffused into the air as it's pulled into the cylinder, in a diesel the fuel is sprayed in when the cylinder is about the top of stroke and the air is compressed. In a gasoline engine you add a spark from a sparkplug, to ignite the gas vapor. In a diesel the heat from compressing the air is enough to ignite the fuel vapor in the cylinder.   Once you light the fuel on fire, it explodes, forcing the piston back down, turning the crankshaft.   As the piston reaches the end of stroke another set of valves in the cylinder head open, these are exhaust valves. They are basically connected to the tail pipe. The piston comes back up, forcing the burn air out of the exhaust side. Near the top of stroke the intake valves open, this let's more exhaust blow out of the cylinder. Then the exhaust valves close and you're back at the start.   You add more cylinders doing the same thing at different times, so that it has more smooth power instead of all of them firing at once. That keeps the crankshaft spinning. You attach a flywheel to the back that is heavy and it will keep momentum going once it's spinning, smoothing out the operation even more. Then you attach whatever you want to run to it.   Can go into more detail or a single component of you want. But that's the basics of it.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why are v8 engines over 5 liters in size common but i4 engines over 2.5 liters are very uncommon?",
    "answer": "I4 engines have excellent Primary Balance characteristics, meaning vibration due to the up-down motion of the pistons cancels each other out. It's easy to see why this works in animations of such engines.  However i4 engines have unusually poor *Second-Order Balance.*   Second-Order balance, also called secondary balance is related to the inevitable side-to-side rocking motion of the connecting rods. This motion causes the center of mass of the connecting rod to not move perfectly in sync with the CM of the piston. Rather, the connecting rod CM moves closer to the top surface of piston by a few mm, at the middle of the stroke then back again at bottom and top dead center. The term \"Second Order\" refers to the fact that this vibration occurs two times per revolution of the crankshaft.   What's worse, in an i4 these vibrations are perfectly in phase with each other with all 4 cylinders.  The fewest number of cylinders you can have and still have good secondary balance is 6.  I6 engines are inherently very well balanced. This is why many large heavily turbocharged diesel engines use this configuration.   At higher engine speed second-order forces grow in relation to the *square* of the crankshaft RPM, rather than in a linear fashion. This means that if you double the RPM the secondary vibration grows by 4x, and if you triple the RPM the vibration grows by 9x. So it's easy to see that this could lead to catastrophic engine failure to the tune of throwing a connecting rod in an i4.  To counteract this ~~almost all~~ (EDIT: *the majority of*) i4 engines have balancing shafts with counterweights that rotate at twice the engine RPM to prevent the engine from shaking itself off the engine mounts above, say, 2500RPM. Indeed most engines with less than 6 cylinders have balancing shafts of some type. This is far from a perfect solution with i4's since this still produces additional forces on the engine block between the crankshaft and balancer bearings that are less than desirable. The balancer shafts consume power themselves and result in higher vibration at idle speed. Their inertia reduces engine revving.   This brings us to the other prescription for the secondary balance problem, which is to reduce the engine redline. It's hard to get around this second part.   So, above 2.8L or so, you end up with a  Law-of -Diminishing-Returns relationship where larger and larger cylinders necessitate heavier connecting rods that cause greater and greater secondary vibration. This means you need to reduce the engine operating speed while using an increasingly heavy balancing shaft that consumes more power, causes more idle vibration, and induces more forces into the engine block between it's own bearings and the crankshaft main bearing. Thus, necessitating a thicker, heavier crankshaft and engine block. Beyond a certain point the fact that you're invariably forced to reduce the redline and increase engine weight in a way that's disproportionate to the displacement, wipes out any additional power you'd gain by increasing the cylinder size. Say, above about 3.5L  A V-8 deals with the secondary balance problem by operating each bank 90\u00b0 out of phase to each other, so that second-order forces in each bank tend to cancel each other instead of adding together constructively. However V-8s often use balancer shafts to counteract high RPM vibrations. The same can be much smaller on V-8 with respect to displacement, a V-8 with 6L does not need a balance shaft twice as large as an i4 with 3L. In fact a smaller one can be used in the former V8.  In V-6 engines there is good second order balance, but you have a moderate issue with primary balance.  A three cylinder engine does not have the outstanding primary balance of an i4, but it is better than a single cylinder. Specifically, in an i3 the uo and down monitions of the pistons to not always perfectly counteract each other. In a V6, unbalanced primary forces can be made to counteract each other best using a 60\u00b0 angle, but this does not entirely eliminate them. So V-6s have primary balance that is not quite a good as V-8's and they vibrate more. Again the usual solution is to reduce the redline RPM. Balancer shafts are also common on v6's  Another solution to the secondary balance problem is the one used by Karl Frederich Benz. He and his company produced the first flat-four opposed piston engine in 1900, using a boxer configuration that should ne familiar to fans of subaru, Porche, or VW cars.   These engines were used in Benz's racing cars, they had 5.4 liters and produced 20 HP, which was excellent at the time. The engines did not need balancer shafts at all and operated much more smoothly than the engines of Benz's competitors.  So why aren't flat-four boxer engines used on most cars? Well because they're significantly more difficult to produce and precision-assemble, and create a number of other less than obvious technical problems.",

    "answer": "In order for your body to get nutrients out of food it needs to break it down into smaller and simpler pieces. Your stomach makes a strong acid to help with this, but it's a bad idea to make it all the time because that acid can damage the stomach. Because of this, your body will try to predict when you usually eat and start making this acid beforehand so that it's ready for the food.  If you go a long time without eating when you normally would, this excess acid can irritate your stomach and esophagus which then causes nausea and discomfort.   Sipping water can help dilute the acid and will also help prevent dehydration (we get a lot of water from our food).  Edit: a word",

Chlorophyll just happens to be green. Since it is green, it absorbs all sunlight *except* the green light that it is reflecting. Importantly, if plants took in too much sunlight they would be damaged by the excess heat, and if they took in too little, they would not get enough energy.  Because of the depths in the ocean where the organisms producing chlorophyll first evolved, green ended up being the right colour to land on when evolving the capability.

That expansion is space itself expanding not stuff being thrown outwards. Think like dots on a balloon that being blown up rather than a bomb.   The universe may be flat -  difficult to get my head around what that means but it leads to the conclusions that it's probably infinite. ( so it's the balloon material opened up flat and never ending *but* still being blown up..?.)   We can only see the bit light has had time to travel from and when we do so we are seeing into the past when the light left that  bit - it would have expanded further since then.   At one point in the past the universe was subject to a period of very fast cosmic inflation and then slowe leaving us with a universe that is both more uniform than you ould otherwise expect but also clumpy.   From the fact  that the universe is expanding people extrapolated that originally everything must have come from the same point but there are apparently  reasons to think that 1. the original state Is just unknowable because all the rules we think we know break down by then  and 2. Perhaps couldnt have been a singularity - something to do with temperatures and exponential growth?   As a matter of interest it also seems ( something)  like the space between galaxies is expanding faster than we expect and galaxies themselves are expanding slower than you would expect ( given the effect of gravity) which has led to theories about dark ( unobserved) matter/energy.

    "answer": "Your whole body actually prefers to sleep a bit cold. Studies have shown that keeping your thermostat at about 65 degrees Fahrenheit is optimal for the deepest sleep. Also, apparently keeping a cool head allows your body to expel heat more effectively (understandably). Since keeping your body warm takes energy and sort of defeats the purpose of sleep (that being to rest), we can imagine why we want to expel this heat. The body temperature we keep while awake is such because our chemical reactions and electrical signals in our body happen most efficiently at these temperatures. We don\u2019t really need to be think and act while asleep, so this conservation of energy while resting makes sense.   So body saves energy and rests easier by being a bit colder. Keeping a cool head is important to expel heat.    Aome anecdotal notes: Actually, for me I quite like my body at the same temperature as my head, it just makes me feel safe and relaxed to be covered, so I continue to sleep with a blanket. Additionally, my hands and feet are often *colder* than my head, so I also sometimes use my blanket to warm them up to the comfortable temperature my head is at, not past it to be warmer.

    "answer": "Spiders don't think, they're just the result of millions of years of spiders with the best habits having the best chance of reproduction. For wheel web spiders, the basic concept is pretty simple really.  Flying insects essentially ride airstreams like a surfer rides waves. That means the best place for a web is across some sort of airflow.  Luckily there's a really easy way to achieve that. The spider starts by letting out an initial guideline in the draft until the airflow picks it up and the end of the line sticks somewhere. When that happens the spider will cut the end of the line it was letting out and attach it where it's sitting. Presto, the spider now has a line crossing a gap.  Now the spider just has to cross that line to create a number of spokes and then create the connecting lines between the spokes.  Spiders can do this pretty quickly really. A very productive web will be repaired and cleaned but an unproductive web will often just be abandoned if it breaks or clutters up. This means that every night, a lot of spiders are trying their luck by building a web someplace new. Most spiderwebs last a few days at best.  And while spiders had millions of years to evolve these clever webs from humble beginnings, the first bicycle appeared only 204 years ago.

Remember the orbitals are electron clouds, its where you have the best chance of finding the electron, its not a rigid path. If you just need to understand to complete assignments, just remember spin directions must oppose in the same orbital/shell.. one up, one down, and so on.. electrons are negatively charged so they ALWAYS repel eachother.   Also, electrons are so small that they do not follow the laws of physics as you and I follow them.

    "answer": "*I may have got a bit carried away here, but I didn't have anything else to do this evening... well, nothing important.*  Electricity is about how things with charge push and pull each other around.  Magnetism is... a weird twisty thing that makes some metals stick to each other sometimes.  Electricity was known about over 4,000 years ago - or rather, they knew about effects of electricity; that certain fish could shock you, that lightning was a weird phenomena, that if you rubbed amber you could get things to stick to it. But without the scientific method or the tools to investigate it it was mostly just a curiosity.  There is evidence of people knowing about magnetism over 2,000 years ago; noticing that there were special rocks that iron would stick to.  Around 600 BCE the Greek philosopher and mathematician Thales of Miletus studied both static electric and magnetic effects, and thought they seemed similar - both involving stuff sticking to other things, but with the magnetic stone always working, and the amber material (used for static electricity) needing to be rubbed to make it stick.  By the 12th century travellers in China and later Europe started using magnetic materials to navigate by - the first magnetic compasses. And with that, studying magnetism became a bit more important. In 1600 an English scientist, William Gilbert published a book called De Magnete, in which he set out a bunch of experiments he'd done on magnetism and electricity, showing that they were separate things (and that Thales was wrong), that the Earth was a giant magnet, and he introduced the term electricus (from the Greek for \"like amber\") to describe what we now call electricity (a term that was first used nearly 50 years later).  The 17th and 19th centuries saw a big increase in research on this new \"electricity\" thing, with people like Benjamin Franklin carrying out all sorts of experiments to try to understand it, in 1800 Alessandro Volta developed a battery that could store electricity; electricity was all the rage - although not necessarily with that many practical uses.  In 1819 a Danish physicist, Hans Christian \u00d8rsted, noticed that if you moved a wire with current flowing in it near a compass, the compass needle twitched.  This was the breakthrough needed to finally start putting the pieces together on how electricity and magnetism worked. Over the next few years people like \u00d8rsted, Amp\u00e8re, Faraday, Ohm and Gauss made great progress in understanding how electricity and magnetism worked and were related, and in the 1860s James Clerk Maxwell put it all together to create a series of laws that showed Electricity and Magnetism to be different aspects of the same thing. Not electricity and magnetism, but electromagnetism. Magnetism could be seen as what happens when you view electric effects from a different perspective. Changing electric effects create magnetic effects, and changing magnetic effects produce electric effects.  But there were a couple of weird things that came out of Maxwell's Equations.  If you solved his equations in a vacuum (where there was no existing electric or magnetic effects), you got waves. Waves travelling at a very specific speed defined by existing electric and magnetic physical constants. This speed - when calculated - turned out to be the same as the speed of light. This was another major breakthrough; understanding that light was ripples in electric and magnetic fields - that it was created by wiggling things with charge. Wiggle the thing with charge and you get a changing electric effect. Now you have a changing electric effect you have a changing magnetic effect. But that changing magnetic effect creates a new changing electric effect and so on and so on... the interchanging electric and magnetic effects keep each other going, moving across space as a combined ripple. Light.  Except not just light. Light is only the part we can see. This stuff helped people understand that a bunch of other things they knew about - ultraviolet light, infra-red radiation, later radio waves, microwaves, x-rays... they were all the same thing, these electromagnetic waves, just with different frequencies of wiggle.  Of course there were still problems with the theories, and it would take people like Einstein to put together more pieces of the puzzle - uncovering Special Relativity and what we now call Quantum Mechanics. By the mid-20th century quantum mechanics was developed enough to fill in the last few bits.  ... so... erm... yes.  **tl;dr**: Electromagnetism is a physical interaction - a way stuff affects other stuff. It used to be electricity and magnetism, but it turns out electric and magnetic effects are just different ways of viewing the same thing.",

So, it asks a special DNS server \"hey, what's [youtube.com](https://youtube.com)?\" And it'll respond \"It's 172.217.13.238!\" (I assume you know what an IP address is, but if not, it's basically like a home address - where a website lives in the internet.)  This is quite an old process, and in most circumstances is still done without any encryption - which basically means the employer can take a peek at it.  All other messages are sent encrypted (with HTTPS). This is that padlock icon in your browser, and it means that before sending anything, the browser and the server agreed to use a secret code so that noone else can read these messages.  However, some browsers (like Firefox (by the way you should totally switch to it it's really good)) can use DNS-over-HTTPS, which is the same encrypted connection to the DNS server. It's not the same level of security as using a VPN though, as they can still see that you're connecting to [172.217.13.238](https://172.217.13.238) and then do a reverse DNS lookup - that tells them you connected to some Google server, which could be anything. But for some websites that will reveal the domain name.  (A VPN would simply hide all of the domain names instead of just the bigger websites. That's most of the security benefits of having a VPN)",

Muscles produce intense energy in short bursts through an anaerobic process that burns glycogen and doesn't require oxygen. The tradeoff is that it cannot be sustained for long periods of time and the muscle is overwhelmed by lactic acid.

Epinephrine (also called adrenaline) is a very important neurotransmitter, and that's also what's in EpiPens. But this doesn't always work for a few reasons.  First, a lot of those chemicals can't easily get from our blood into our brain tissue (or vice versa) since there's a protective barrier. Even the dopamine pump above uses a modified version of dopamine that can, but we can't always do that well.  Second, when you dump a bunch of hormones or chemicals on the body the body reacts by making less of that hormone itself to try to keep itself in balance. This can sometimes cause serious side effects.  Third, very very few problems in the brain are due to a simple issue of \"not enough of a single chemical\" (even Parkinson's, which is basically caused by the brain not being able to make dopamine anymore, is more complicated) You don't water plants in your house with a fire hose because the water that's really good for the plants isn't so great for your computer on the desk next to them.

    "question": "ELI5: Can there be a machine that\u2019s an \u201canti-lightbulb\u201d?",
    "answer": "There are two answers to this question: No, because light doesn't work that way; *or* Yes, but it's Complicated.  On the \"no\" side, you have the fact that light, as a form of energy, can neither be created nor destroyed. It just moves around from place to place. (This is called the \"conservation of energy.\" For complicated math reasons, the fact that physics works the same if you \"run\" time forwards or backwards *requires* that energy cannot be destroyed.) So, as others have said, you could use something like a black hole to suck up light, but that's just shunting the light into that space, which isn't really the anti-lightbulb with a darkness aura around it like you are asking for.  On the \"yes\" side, there is a very complex, very difficult way that could *theoretically* work, but it would require much more advanced technology than we possess. This is because light is made of tiny wave-packets, which we call photons. Each photon, theoretically, has a perfect equal and opposite: one with the same amplitude, but exactly reversed peaks and troughs (high and low ponts) in the wave. If these waves meet perfectly, so each high part of one wave is exactly where the corresponding low part of the other wave is, then the effect is cancelled out, and it will be as if there is no photon present at all. Then they will pass by each other and be detectable again. If--and this is a very BIG if--you could make a device that could *exactly* match the incoming photons with its own outgoing photons, you could make an anti-lightbulb that would create a halo of unlit space around itself. This would be very, very difficult however, and we probably do not have computers good enough to calculate which light needs to go where *fast enough* to make one work, even in an extremely rigidly controlled environment.  However, while doing this with *light* is very hard, doing it with *sound* is actually (sort of) possible! As an example, think of being at a concert, where the same sound waves are being sent out of two different speaker units. If those speaker units are positioned correctly, there will be points where the sound waves from one speaker will exactly cancel out the sound waves of the other speaker, meaning a microphone at that point would hear (effectively) silence. The effect is not perfect silence normally, because in the real world, objects have volume, whereas the place where the waves cancel out is (in theory) a single point. But you can absolutely experience these points of silence in the real world! You can also get the exact opposite phenomena, where sound gets reinforced to become louder than it would be otherwise, because the two waves *stack* their high parts right on top of each other (same for the low parts).  The formal physics term for waves that cancel out is \"destructive interference\" (the two waves combine to make a \"weaker\" wave), and for waves that amplify it's called \"constructive interference\" (the two waves combine to make a \"stronger\" wave).",

    "answer": "\"Meat\" isn't just muscle flesh from an animal.  There is a very rapid aging process that occurs in meat shortly after an animal dies.  Depending on the animal's health and stress level at the time it died, you end up with with one of three outcomes:  1) PSE meat, which is light colored and spongy  2) Normal meat, which is the stuff you find in your supermarket  3) DFD meat, which is dark, tough, and has the \"gamey\" taste people associate with non-traditional animals.  The taste itself is the result of the meat being less acidic than normal meat.  Animals killed on a large, commercial farm will be in good health and are killed instantly, so that the animal doesn't experience any stress while dying.  This results in mostly normal meat being produced from their carcasses.  There will be some PSE and DFD meat but it either gets turned into pet food or thrown out.  When people go out and hunt meat they're killing animals that are typically in poor health and/or which are under a lot of stress (if for no other reason than that getting shot and slowly bleeding to death is stressful).  This almost always produces DFD meat.  Because people associate game animals with the gamey taste of DFD meat, some ranches that grow those animals commercially will deliberately produce DFD meat to maintain the gamey taste that people expect.    But if you were to kill a game animal in the same manner as a domestic animal (IE, killing it instantaneously when at peak physical condition) then it would taste pretty similar to the meat from domestic animals.",

Common Core was designed with a goal: to significantly increase the number of students graduating high school with the higher math knowledge such as basic Calculus, Trigonometry, etc.  that previously only a small percentage of the students managed during their high school education.  In the process of figuring out how to do this it became apparent that a lot of the traditional way that math concepts were presented and taught starting in Kindergarten and continuing in the primary school years were at best not optimal, and at worst actually counter-productive once students had to make transitions beyond arithmetic. This resulted in the creation of a unified curriculum of study that planned the whole set of goals, grade by grade, and how it was presented with this goal in mind.  They way that initial arithmetic is taught in Kindergarten is done with the goal of making sure that the math is taught not just to get whatever concept is currently being taught into their brains, but to always be focused on what they are going to have to learn down the road and lay the foundation for that.  One thing that stuck in my head while talking to my GF about it was that she noted how it become apparent how important it was to get the parents to understand that Common Core needed to be viewed as a 13 year process starting in Kindergarten and coming to fruition when their child graduated the 12th grade.  The standards were introduced in CA in 2014-15 school year, this means that the first class of students who will graduate having been taught by this method for their entire public school education will be the class of 2028.

The \"dimension\" of something refers to how many pieces of information you need to locate something within a space. You need those four values to precisely identify where and when something is, and so spacetime is (classically, at least) four-dimensional.  The reason time slows down at high speeds is more complicated than it appears on the surface: light *always* travels at the speed of light.

    "question": "ELI5: Why isnt Omicron a good thing?",
    "answer": "Ever played Pandemic? The way you win Pandemic is to be *highly* infectious but very low lethality. Then, once the entire world is infected, you buy heart failure.   Reality doesn't work like that - the same mutation doesn't arise simultaneously in all instances of the virus - but the important part, that high infectivity, low lethality viruses are S tier, is true. High infectivity and low lethality allows the virus to propagate and multiply. The more people are infected, the more copies of the virus there are. The more copies of the virus there are, the more opportunities the virus has to develop new mutations.   Omicron will already have mutated a bunch of times. Most of those mutations won't change anything. Some of them will make it less effective. Some of them will make it more infective. Some of them will make it more deadly, meaning it's both high infectivity and high lethality. When that happens (and it is a when, not an if), it'll become the next major variant and it could potentially be worse than the first wave. Basically, the fewer people infected, the less likely new mutations are to emerge. A strain that can infect a lot of people is bad because of the future mutation potential.  There's also a matter of simple maths. Imagine that Delta Covid infects 10,000 people per day and hospitalises 1% of infected. That's 100 new admissions to hospitals per day. Now imagine Omicron has half the hospitalisation rate of Delta, but has three times the infectivity. Omicron infects 30,000 people per day, and hospitalises 0.5% of them. That's 150 new admissions per day. That's worse overall even though Omicron is less lethal individually, because it's infecting so many more people.",

Something that needs a more expensive software license. Some cable that is not good enough.  And, and this is really more important than you think, you cut out every single one of your customers who still own fully functional, a bit older, equipment.  It's the kind of thing that you are going to loose customers over. And with them, income.  The incentive to offer a better quality service eventually outweighs the incentive to keep customers with old equipment happy. But the harsh reality is that most people buy a new TV once every ten-fifteen years or so and expect to keep it until it doesn't turn on any more.

And that's not all, those devices produce a lot of heat too. So mining rigs will require industrial-scale cooling systems to keep the processing units from overheating and catching fire.

    "answer": "Fans tend to have longer lifespans, beyond CPU fans you typically have multiple fans serving a particular purpose (case fans, GPU fans, etc) so if one fails you're not going to immediately have an extremely bad time, and they're dirt cheap and simple to replace if one does fail.  Pumps tend to have somewhat shorter (although still long) lifespans, but you don't have redundancy - so there's more use in trying to reduce the wear for a component intended for long term use. They're also more expensive and complicated to replace if a failure does occur.",

    "answer": "The ideal antenna for one particular wavelength and beam direction is relatively easy to figure out...it's a stick of the right length and right orientation relative to the beam. The challenge is usually that nobody wants infinite sticks, you often don't have room for a stick of the right length, and you don't know what direction the wave is coming from.  If you know that it's all going to come at you mostly in a flat plane, but you don't know what direction, a pole is fine. See: basically every car antenna of the 1900s or all early cell phones. If you can steer the antenna to point at the source that's also fine (see: all those dishes on satellites and ships and news vans...not the dish itself, that's just a \"radio mirror\", but you can steer the actual antenna.   After that, it's all compromises that make the antenna worse at actually picking things up but potentially better at fitting into where you want it. If you can make it bigger enough to overcome the performance degradation enough to come out ahead on shape, you're OK. This is how you can embed antennas in the window glass of your car now, or in the flat panel of your computer, or the edge or back of your phone.   The ideal antenna length scales with wavelength...as we've gone to higher and higher frequencies (smaller wavelengths) antennas also got way smaller.",

    "question": "ELI5 What's that feeling when you learn/hear a new word for the first time and then start seeing/noticing it everywhere?",
    "answer": "The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon is actually a term for 'frequency illusion', a type of cognitive bias your mind creates. To understand this, you need to know a little about cognitive bias as a whole. Though there's a whole lot of nuisances caused by cognitive bias, in short, it\u2019s when your mind deviates from normal, rational thought and starts to make up patterns based off of nonsense.   \u2026frequency illusion is, in fact, two different processes happening at the same time: selective attention and confirmation bias.  The first process, selective attention, comes about when you learn anything new. Basically, when you learn something new, it stays fresh in your mind - you\u2019re paying more attention to it than other things. Because of this, you see it more often when going about your daily life.  However, this very simple, logical process is amped up by confirmation bias, which is a cognitive bias that makes you \"search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions, leading to statistical errors\", reports ScienceDaily.  This means that your mind is on the look-out for newly learned information because it\u2019s still super fresh and interesting to you. At the same time, your mind sees these new words everywhere, thinks that it's weird, and tries to make it fit into some rational system.  In other words, because the information is new, you suddenly force yourself to believe that it's new to everyone and has suddenly popped up, when in reality, you\u2019ve just stopped ignoring it.  You actually see new words more often and believe there\u2019s some weird pattern at work because your mind is trying to make sense of new information. It just so happens that most of it is made up.  - [article](https://www.sciencealert.com/you-know-how-when-you-learn-a-new-word-you-see-it-everywhere-here-s-why)",

And you could write an equation to describe how these numbers change that agrees exactly with how a 3D creature could model the \"height\" of the wave.  In the same way, we can apply this same equation - with three position coordinates instead of two - to 3D space. Every point in space has a number attached to it, and those numbers change according to a law that is mathematically related to the same law that governs the height of the water on a 2D surface.

Let's start with these. Telescopes are not far away. A telescope is a device which is either on Earth (99.99% of all telescopes), or in a few hundred kilometer orbit around Earth (e.g. Hubble), or planned to be installed on the moon (ca. 350 000 km from Earth, but none are yet in existance). There are cameras on far away vessels sent 50 years ago like Voyager, but those are not telescopes, and even if they were, they have close to no data transmission capacity, so the pictures would never reach Earth in any useful resolution.  >And isn't the galaxy somehow infinite?  No. The universe is probably infinite. The universe contains hundreds of billions of galaxies, one of which is our galaxy, called the Milky Way. The Milky Way is a fairly standard galaxy containing some few hundred billion stars arranged in a spiral pattern around a center which is theorized to contain a black hole. We know very precisely how big that spiral is and thus it is not infinite.  >But I don't quite know how can we see things light years away from us  That's easy. If a star is 1000 light years away from us, then it shines brightly, sends light out in all directions, some of which travels without ever hitting anything for 1000 years until it finally hits our telescope. The telescope registers that some light hit it from a certain direction, and puts it on a picture in the form of a bright spot. And yes, there's no guarantee that that star is still existing at this very moment that we see it. Even our own Sun could already have exploded and we would only know it about 7 minutes later, when the light (and thus the first signs of the explosion) hits us.",

    "answer": "Spectrum analysers often work based on something called the Fast Fourier Transform.  This is a mathematical technique which lets us look at a wave, let's say the sound of a lion's roar, and instead of looking at how it changes over time (like having a loud beginning, slowly getting quieter, and a few grumbles at the end), asking what other waves it is made of.  That feels like a big jump, but it's simpler than you think. Sticking with sound, you may know that the pitch of a sound is determined by something called it's frequency. This is mostly true, but it's not the full picture. Sounds are made up of lots and lots of frequencies all added together. This is what makes a violin sound different to a flute if they're playing the same note. What this means is that if you take a very simple wave which genuinely only has a single frequency, called a sine wave, and start adding very special amounts of other waves of very specific frequencies, you can actually build sounds from scratch - this is called \"additive synthesis\", by the way.  What the Fast Fourier Transform does is tell you exactly what amount of *all* frequencies have gone into making whatever wave it's looking at. This is sometimes called a \"decomposition\", because it is looking at what the wave is composed of.  Why is it associated with ghost hunters?

    "answer": "If you sweat then you are warm. So the clothes do keep you warm or the temperature is so high you do not need them. Let ignore the case when you would sweat with no clothes on, getting cold and freezing is not usually a problem in conditions like that.  If you sweat and have clothes on you have a problem. There is water on your skin, to keep dry it needs to move to the surrounding environment. So you need clothes that let the water through. It can be water that wicks out as a liquid from your skin and then evaporate and become a gas, it can also be water the evaporate on your skin. Regardless of how it happens if your water can't escape you will be weat.  So if you have clothes that do not let water through and sweat will stay inside them and are what.    Cloth is not warming you unless they have an active heat source, which is quite uncommon but to exist. What clothes do is reduce the rate hat is transported from your body to the environment. The way is done is primary to have material that traps a lot of air and stops it from moving. Air is a bad conductor of heat so this will keep you warm. Water is a good conductor of heat and will so water-soaked closed will transport heat away from your body and you get cold.  If you keep water from escaping you also keep air from escaping and that will reduce the rate heat is transported from your body.  So they will make you warmer but can make you warm and then you sweat.  So if you sweat profusely the clothes are keeping you warm or more exactly to warm. They might not keep you warm when they are wet but then you have stopped sweating.  One major way to stay warm is to remove clothes when you are active so you do not sweat. If you will do some physical activity that makes you warm remove clothes so you start to feel a bit too cold when stationary. When you then start to move you will get warmer and hopefully, you do not get so hot so you sweat.  It is a mistake to dress for being stationary and then start moving.

We've evolved to fool ourselves in this way; maybe for some survival reason, or maybe just as a side effect of intelligence or something. Nobody knows for sure.

This takes a lot of practice and can be difficult. I'm skeptical that 100% of people are capable of it (though I can't be sure, it may just be easier for some than others).  So it's not exactly impossible, but like many skills, takes many many thousands of hours of practice and doesn't come naturally to most to \"not think anything\".",

    "answer": "Sounds like you're talking about fraternities? In the US in colleges we have fraternities (otherwise known as \"frats\") for men and sororities for women, and they take inspiration from Greek culture. You have initiation phases to join them (can be called \"hazing,\" which colleges have been cracking down on more recently), you often have to be \"selected,\" and you have to pay to be/stay in them. Each frat or sorority has it's own little culture and secrets.   I went to a pretty big college, though were were more known for our academics than our frats + sororities. Frats are often huge in US colleges that are known for partying and social life. In my college, the frat + sorority culture wasn't that serious and I didn't bother w/ them.

I recall having assembled a computer where the shield of the front receptacle wasn't grounded because of the design of the case, and the computer would lock up often when a device was plugged in. You don't want to short 5Vcc to the ground or data while sliding the jack in and destroy the motherboard. The pinout of the very first boards with USB was sometimes backwards, and one had to double check it in the manual or measure.  I don't think it is a good idea to make connectors for different purposes look the same. You don't want 5 volts DC applied to headphones either. That would them out. The present situation where a data port doubles as a power socket on portable devices is strange.

    "answer": "TL:DR Molecules enter-stay for differing lengths of time depending on factors-maybe get peed out-it\u2019s way more complicated than it should be.  Yay, something I know!  You drink a glass of water and it enters the esophagus on route to stomach. From the stomach  enters the small intestine which is a long and wildly bendy ride. Lots of nutrients from food are absorbed into the blood stream up to this point. After the small intestine the water enters the colon on its way out of you in the form of poop. The majority of water reabsorption into the bloodstream will occur in the distal colon (the section right before your butt) in the form of individual H2O molecules. So now the water is in your body for real.  Once the H2O molecule is in your blood stream it is pumped around your entire body by your heart. At some point it will pass through the kidneys where toxins, electrolytes, and water are removed. The kidneys are connected to the bladder via some tubes and the bladder releases its urine to the outside world via the urethra (the thin tube in the penis or vagina).  It\u2019s important to note that everything your eat and drink is absorbed into your body as individual molecules. So, a glass of water doesn\u2019t enter your body as such. It enters one molecule at a time. Each molecule will stay inside of your body for differing lengths of time; some get incorporated into cells or the fluid surrounding cells (interstitial fluid), some are sweated out, some are peed out, and some are bled out... And some don\u2019t make it in in the first place, they stay in the colon and are incorporated into your poop.   Fun fact: if you have kidney failure you become completely anuric (unable to make urine). In this case you will NEVER pee out the molecules from the glass of water. Instead, they will pool in the extremities causing swelling and need to be removed with medications or dialysis!",

    "answer": "What about windows? Windows are essentially solid walls. They can be quick thick, fairly sturdy, and pretty solid. Except light can go through them.  Different materials are transparent to different frequencies of light. For example, stained-glass windows give pretty coloured patters because they are transparent to some colours of light but not others (a red glass panel absorbs frequencies of light that aren't red). Similarly, glass is generally pretty good at blocking (some) ultraviolet light. We don't notice because we can't see it, but if we could see in UV windows would look solid, like walls.  The specific patterns of what frequencies are absorbed by what materials are complicated and we don't want to get into them. But walls are transparent to some frequencies of radio waves (they are also pretty good at bending around corners). Some frequencies may have issues going through walls (like light going through a frosted glass window), but that isn't as much of a problem for radio signals as we don't need to receive the full image (like we do for seeing things), just the signal from one bit.  If you could \"see\" radio waves anything emitting them (a wireless router, a phone, signal towers) would have a fuzzy glow, and you might be able to see that through walls (kind of like objective markers in some computer games).",

But there has been a longstanding utility of presenting different numbers to the network. As a former call center engineer we would create various groups of call center agents (both inbound and outbound calls) that would need the calling line identification modified for each customer or campaign. I could literally type any number I wanted into the field on the phone system (12345678, or 000000000) even the number of another company. Interstingly if I entered the number of another company or institution, the public network would automatically insert the name of the company in addition to the number I presented.

    "answer": "So I\u2019m no expert and I\u2019m not sure exactly how age impacts the equation, but I would think that it probably increases recovery time and diminishes gains both intrinsically and as a result of the lost training from increased recovery periods.. that being said, gradually over time a person who practices regular cardio exercise will have more blood in their body, resulting in more visible veins. They will have a lower resting heart rate, and improved energy levels over someone who is more sedentary. They are at greater risk for joint injury, but proper supplements and weight exercise can mitigate these effects. As far as pulmonary health in concerned, if they\u2019re not actively smoking or contributing to worsening their lung health, it should improve health in this regard, even going so far as to reverse some of the harmful effects of past smoking.  At first, the training will be difficult and it\u2019s best to approach it in intervals of run/walk. Over the first month or 2 of consistent practice, this should get to the point where you\u2019re able to run consistently without the need to stop, and all the aforementioned benefits start to kick in. If you\u2019re looking for advice on training to be faster, plyometric workouts and integrating more interval-based training into your schedule are where you would want to look. Otherwise, it can just be something where you go out for a few miles a day and enjoy the leisure of moving freely.  Lastly, the key to any cardio exercise is core strength.

I don't know if that quite counts as the bulb repelling light. The bulb \"tells\" the entangled particles what to do, and that \"what to do\" is \"pull [get] these photons away from me,\" so maybe?  Fundamentally I think the problem is that darkness is the absence of light, and light isn't the absence of darkness (except experientially). It's very much like conceiving of the hot and the cold. The cold just is an absence of heat (particles moving), so those problems and solutions don't have the kind of symmetry that we might like them to have.

Antibodies, on the other hand, are molecules which specifically interact with pathogens/\u201cbad\u201dmolecules in the body. Different T cells have different duties, but generally they are responsible for recognizing the presence of pathogens (with the help of other immune cells, like macrophages which first kill any non-\u201cyou\u201d cells, like foreign bacteria). Once a T cell recognizes a pathogen, it can signal the rest of the immune system to get the body ready to fight the pathogen. Other types of T cells then go through the body and destroy any of your own cells that have been infected.  Another part of the response is the production of B cells. Each B cell is created to fight the specific pathogen by producing antibodies which will only recognize that pathogen. The antibodies go through the body and attach to any of the pathogen they find, which lets them be quickly recognized and broken down by other immune cells.  Other B cells (memory B cells) are responsible for staying in the immune system \u201cheadquarters\u201d and keeping a record of the pathogen so that if you get infected again even years later, the correct antibodies can be produced much much quicker.

    "question": "ELI5: What's the source of light scientists talk about?",
    "answer": "The speed of light is quite poorly named, to be honest.  Think of it more as the speed of reality.  If I make a change to the universe HERE you will see that change happen when that reality - moving at \"the speed of light\" - reaches you.  It doesn't matter if that change is a physical object, a light beam, gravitational pull, radio waves, whatever... the \"reality\" of it having changed moves outwards from that event at the speed of light.  If you were 1 light-year away, and I turned on a torch, you won't see that torch turn on until my reality expands out to meet yours, which will take a year.  If you were 1 light-year away, and I died, you couldn't ever possibly know that I'd died until the reality of my death has expanded so far that it touches your reality.  There's no way to \"cheat\" it by sending a message announcing my death ahead, it would only ever reach you at the speed that the reality of the event expands.  If the sun disappeared into nothingness this instant, being 8 light-minutes away, it would take 8 minutes before Earth suddenly WASN'T being pulled by the Sun, and stopped orbiting.  We wouldn't know the Sun had gone optically for those 8 minutes either.  Those 8 minutes are how long whatever-is-happening on the Sun takes to reach the part of the solar-system we live in.  This is why when we look back at stars, we can say that a star is as it appeared a million years ago, etc.  We know that because they are a million light-years away.  Hence the \"reality\" of whatever happened to that star hasn't reached us until a million years later.  That star is probably long dead and gone.  The speed of light is the speed of reality.  It's really the speed limit of the entire universe because of that.  NOTHING can go faster than reality itself, but reality isn't instantaneously everywhere.  It takes a while for the reality to catch up and expand out because the distances are so vast.  If you \\*could\\* go faster than the speed of light, you could actually get somewhere, and then look back and watch yourself leave on that journey.  And the \"you\" that left would have been able to see the \"you\" that's already there, before you leave!  It basically turns almost into time travel, which is paradoxical and therefore we believe it's just not possible to do.  You would be able to send a radio message to yourself in the past, and things like that, and we don't think that's \"allowed\" in physics without everything breaking.  The speed of light is just called the speed of light, light is just an incidental example of it.  Think of it as the speed of \"reality\" and it starts to make much more sense.  Around a black hole, for instance, gravity has so curved space and time that the reality of whatever happens inside the black hole cannot ever make it out the black hole.  Hence we know nothing about what happens inside a black hole and anyone inside of one knows nothing about what happens outside.  It basically \"chops\" the realities in two, and they never meet again.",

    "question": "ELI5: what do Galois groups actually prove about solvability?",
    "answer": "It is a bit complicated but let me try. First, there's two notions called \"solvability,\" one for polynomials and one for groups (I'll explain what groups are later). They'll turn out to be very intimately related, although it may not look like it from the get go. First let me explain the polynomial side of things, it might be a bit easier to grasp.  Ok, so start with a field (we usually take Q, so if you're not sure what the general definition of a field is, just picture rational numbers). You can ask yourself \"what's the smallest set containing Q and some real number that isn't in Q which has a coherent addition and multiplication such that all the \"nice\" properties hold (distributivity, commutativity, associativity, additive and multiplicative inverses)? For example, what's the smallest \"nice\" set (field) containing Q and sqrt(2)? Well, it turns out the best you can do is take all of Q and add all rational multiples of sqrt(2), so you end up with a set consisting of all rational numbers, all rational multiples of sqrt(2), and all possible sums of those. So, \u00bd is an element. So is 3/4xsqrt(2), and so is 4/435435+ 32/9sqrt(2). More generally, any element can be written as a+bsqrt(2), for a and b rational numbers. That set is written Q\\[sqrt(2)\\] (Q adjoin root 2).   Now, I may want to solve a polynomial like x\\^2 -2. The roots as you know are sqrt 2 and - sqrt 2, so they aren't rational. The smallest extension of the rational numbers in which I can find every single root is (in this case) Q\\[sqrt(2)\\]. That means that if I wanted to write that polynomial in factored form, the smallest place I could do it is in Q\\[sqrt(2)\\]. We say that this polynomial is \"solvable\" because I can write it in factored form in some extension of Q which I get to by adding roots. (There's nothing special about only adjoining root 2. I could adjoin any nth root of any rational number, and I could do that as many times as I want. So, something like Q\\[sqrt(2), cube root(1252), sqrt(34564)\\] is also a radical extension, and a polynomial which splits into linear factors in that extension would also be solvable).   Now let's turn to group theory. A group is just a set of symmetries of something -- it's all the ways you can reorder a thing and preserve it in some way. For example, the set of reorderings of the numbers (1,2) is a group containing the elements \"do nothing\" and \"switch 1 and 2.\" Certain groups have a property called \"solvability\" which is technical and seemingly unmotivated. Let's treat it as a black box.   Now, Galois theory relates extensions like Q\\[sqrt 2\\] to groups in a very precise way. For each extension, you can find a unique polynomial which factors linearly over that extension \\*and\\* when you combine all the factors, you get a polynomial with coefficients in Q \\*and\\* is as small (low degree) as possible. In the Q\\[sqrt 2\\] example, that polynomial is x\\^2-2 and it's called the minimal polynomial. The Galois group of the extension is the group which swaps all the roots of the minimal polynomial between each other (in a coherent way). For Q\\[sqrt 2\\], the Galois group is the group which can do 2 things: nothing, or swap sqrt(2) and -sqrt(2), and leave everything else the same. What that means is that the group \"acts\" on the extension. Say I take the group element g which swaps the roots. Then I can apply that element to a random element a + b sqrt(2) of Q\\[sqrt 2\\]. Then g(a+bsqrt(2)) = a-b sqrt(2), because I switch the roots and leave everything else the same.   If that group has the \"solvable\" property, then that polynomial is \"solvable\". Ie, I can write all of its roots in some extension of Q that I get to only by adding some nth roots. The same thing works in reverse: If I can solve a polynomial only by adding nth roots, then the galois group of that extension is solvable. If one of those conditions fails, then the other one must fail as well.   What Galois showed is that every possible group associated to a field where the degree of the minimal polynomial is less than 5 is solvable, but that some groups bigger than that are not solvable. So that implies that every polynomial of degree < 5 is such that every solution is a radical expression, but not every polynomial of degree >= 5 satisfies that.",

    "answer": "The mathematical constant e is referred to as representing natural growth. Unlike other popular constants like pi, e does not have a handy visual to explain it. Instead it can be thought of using banks and interest: (For true ELI5, interest means \"the bank will add 'this much' to your money at the specified time)  If we have a bank that generously offers 100% interest every year, and you give them $1, then after a year you will have $2.  But wait! A rival bank wants to offer 50% interest TWICE a year if you bank with them. At first, you may think that 50% twice = 100% once, but that isn't the case. After 6 months with this bank, your total + interest will be $1.50. Then another 6 months later it would be $2.25, getting $0.75 from 50% of the $1.50.  So it would seem that even if the % interest adds to the same 100%, getting it more often leads to giving you more money! So what about a bank that offers 25% interest every 3 months? Or 8.3% every month? How about an inconceivablely small percentage interest at every fraction of a millisecond throughout the year?  You'll find that the final amount tends toward the value of e if you were able to gain interest at a \"natural\" rate of growth.  100% once a year: $2  50% twice a year: $2.25  25% four times a year: $2.4414  8.3% twelve times a year: $2.613035  Every possible moment in a year: $2.71828 (approaching the value of e)  e is also important in Calculus and the natural log, but those are waaaay beyond a 5 year old.",

Socially, that implies that a hybrid neanderthal-human individual was not only possible, but that such individuals were accepted parts of their community and lived until adulthood (implying they weren't too weak or sickly to survive). Depending on ancestry there's also a very high likelihood that a given individual will carry the markers of minor neanderthal  additions to their genes. It's much lower in sub-Saharan groups, much higher in Eurasian, because neanderthals really didn't backtrack from Eurasia into Africa once they evolved.  There's also a high margin of human-caused extinction through out-competing them. Tools known to be made by neanderthals as opposed to modern human ancestors don't show many significant changes over an astoundingly long time- We were figuring out how to make better tools, they weren't. With better tools, we had better living. Eventually, it's suggested, there just became more and more of us, less and less of them, until we were all that was left.   More like neighborhood gentrification, and less of an explicit war where two groups met on a battlefield and murdered each other to death.     There's also an argument to be made for climate change as a cause. It's a theory that's getting stronger and stronger in regards to Pleistocene megafauna (with the exception of australia); that it wasn't just anthropocentric, and as the ice age ended, biomes changed. Eventually they changed to a point of not being able to support the megafauna.... Or the neanderthals.     There are a lot of factors at play, and we really aren't at a place where we can point to any one of them and say \"That. That's why.\", all we can do is extrapolate from the evidence we have and keep piecing things together as new discoveries are made.     \\--Of Note; I don't have a Ph.D or anything, I just never outgrew the 'dinosaur' phase..",

    "question": "ELI5: does wind make a sound? Or is what we hear when wind howls the sound of wind passing through trees and other solid objects, as opposed to being the sound of the air itself moving?",
    "answer": "Hearing scientist here.  Yes and yes.  When we hear, its because the air in our ear is pushing and pulling on the eardrum.  If this pushing and pulling has a regular structure to it, we hear it as a particular pitch or mix of pitches.  This covers music, but also voices, bells, and a bunch of stuff.  If the push/pull is a very short, intense burst, it's more like a click or snap that we hear.  (More detail: this is really a wide range of different pitches stacked on top for a short amount of time.)  If the push/pull is chaotic, we hear noise like a woosh or a hiss.  When wind blows past your ears, it doesn't flow smoothly.  It's turbulent, constantly changing.  This means some of the bits of wind will push extra air into your ear, or try to suck air out.  This pushes and pulls on your eardrum in a chaotic way, and you hear it as noise.  When the wind makes more of an \"ooooh\" noise, that's just that its a bit more structured, usually flowing quickly in one direction, so we hear it as a particular pitch.  Actually, its often a burst of wind that's speeding up, so we hear the pitch rising.  But we *can* also hear the chaotic vibrations that get made as it flows through trees and things.  It's just that they're not any more distinct than the noise at our ears.  However, gaps between buildings etc. help make the air flow a particular way, which lends itself to the \"ooooh\" sound.  We can also hear this sometimes when it flows through channels like chimneys, as if the wind is playing the flute.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why can't we remember anything before about age 5 or so?",
    "answer": "There are a few reasons:  1.) Our brains are quite underdeveloped when we are born, so we don\u2019t have the ability to form long-term memories right away. That takes a couple of years.   2.) You can think of memories as being part of a giant \u201cweb\u201d of neurons in the brain. You are able to retrieve a memory as long as the strings connected to that memory are intact. When we\u2019re little, our brains grow *a lot*. New connections are constantly being formed, and many of those connections disrupt the parts of the web of memories that has already formed. And once the old connection is broken, it becomes very difficult to access those memories.   3.) The last reason is just that we don\u2019t know *what* we\u2019re supposed to remember. Absolutely everything is new and everything *feels* big and important. But even as adults, there\u2019s a limit to how much we can process at once...so we usually get rid of the stuff that\u2019s doesn\u2019t matter as much to make room for the important memories.

    "question": "ELI5: What is \"Ray Tracing\" in a video game, and how does it differ from previously made reflections?",
    "answer": "Yes, that's precisely it, in a sense.  Games run at very fast speeds, often times more than 60 frames per second. That means, the GPU has less than 16.66ms to render one frame at 1920x1080 resolution, or the game will start to dip below 60 FPS.  Now, have you heard the commonly circulated internet fact that a single frame of Frozen took a week to render? So how do we do that, but in 16ms? The answer is that engineers created \"hacky\" ways to render your game that are in no way physically accurate, but will produce okay-ish results really quickly.  One of the most difficult things to simulate with these \"fake\" methods are reflections. Because well, reflections are inherently a byproduct of realism. Light bouncing around multiple times makes things reflect off each other. We certainly cannot afford to do that kind of processing, otherwise it would take longer to render the frame, and we don't want to play games with the FPS of a slide show.  But the engineers are smart, so they created special methods to once again \"fake\" the reflections. For example, [cube maps](https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced/cubemaps_skybox.png)! These work by pre-rendering beforehand the reflection of the world around the object, and then drawing a texture based on that rendering. So, when you play the game, it's simply just drawing a texture, not rendering multiple bouncing light rays. The downside of this method is that it does not allow dynamic reflections, because the textures are already pre-rendered beforehand and cannot change.  With ray tracing, like the name implies, games are able to draw light rays (simulating light bouncing) more realistically, and hence draw real time reflections and such, but without much more effort. This can be done with the help of the novel RT cores that Nvidia developed in their 2xxx and 3xxx cards.",

    "question": "ELI5: Can there be a machine that\u2019s an \u201canti-lightbulb\u201d?",
    "answer": "There are two answers to this question: No, because light doesn't work that way; *or* Yes, but it's Complicated.  On the \"no\" side, you have the fact that light, as a form of energy, can neither be created nor destroyed. It just moves around from place to place. (This is called the \"conservation of energy.\" For complicated math reasons, the fact that physics works the same if you \"run\" time forwards or backwards *requires* that energy cannot be destroyed.) So, as others have said, you could use something like a black hole to suck up light, but that's just shunting the light into that space, which isn't really the anti-lightbulb with a darkness aura around it like you are asking for.  On the \"yes\" side, there is a very complex, very difficult way that could *theoretically* work, but it would require much more advanced technology than we possess. This is because light is made of tiny wave-packets, which we call photons. Each photon, theoretically, has a perfect equal and opposite: one with the same amplitude, but exactly reversed peaks and troughs (high and low ponts) in the wave. If these waves meet perfectly, so each high part of one wave is exactly where the corresponding low part of the other wave is, then the effect is cancelled out, and it will be as if there is no photon present at all. Then they will pass by each other and be detectable again. If--and this is a very BIG if--you could make a device that could *exactly* match the incoming photons with its own outgoing photons, you could make an anti-lightbulb that would create a halo of unlit space around itself. This would be very, very difficult however, and we probably do not have computers good enough to calculate which light needs to go where *fast enough* to make one work, even in an extremely rigidly controlled environment.  However, while doing this with *light* is very hard, doing it with *sound* is actually (sort of) possible! As an example, think of being at a concert, where the same sound waves are being sent out of two different speaker units. If those speaker units are positioned correctly, there will be points where the sound waves from one speaker will exactly cancel out the sound waves of the other speaker, meaning a microphone at that point would hear (effectively) silence. The effect is not perfect silence normally, because in the real world, objects have volume, whereas the place where the waves cancel out is (in theory) a single point. But you can absolutely experience these points of silence in the real world! You can also get the exact opposite phenomena, where sound gets reinforced to become louder than it would be otherwise, because the two waves *stack* their high parts right on top of each other (same for the low parts).  The formal physics term for waves that cancel out is \"destructive interference\" (the two waves combine to make a \"weaker\" wave), and for waves that amplify it's called \"constructive interference\" (the two waves combine to make a \"stronger\" wave).",

    "question": "ELI5: How does an EMP work?",
    "answer": "When a nuclear weapon goes off it releases a huge amount of UV/Xrays/Gamma rays which move outward and smack into electrons of air molecules with enough energy to knock them loose and send the electrons flying.  This huge and sudden current of electrons quickly moving away from the center point creates a suddenly changing magnetic field.  We use this feature in transformers and wireless chargers.  If you change a current it creates a changing magnetic field which can be coupled into a nearby wire to create a current in that wire so you can pass power wirelessly.  For nuclear EMPs \"nearby\" is hundreds of miles away and the changing magnetic field is insanely strong.  The US did a test called [Starfish Prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_Prime) where they detonated a nuke about 400 km up(roughly the height of the space station which didn't exist yet).     Starfish Prime ended up creating a field over Hawaii (900 miles away) that was 5600 Volts/meter which means a 10 meter long power line would generate 56,000 volts at the end of it.  This is pretty bad for power lines and blew out a few hundred streetlights, but it was really before the era of microelectronics.  A 5mm long trace in your smart phone would have experienced 28 volts which is pretty devastating to a system expecting to run at less than 5 volts.

First, think of a keyword, like EARTH  Second, come up with the phrase you'd like to encrypt, like HELLO WORLD  You write out your message and then the key word underneath, repeating the keyword as necessary:  |H|E|L|L|O|W|O|R|L|D| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |E|A|R|T|H|E|A|R|T|H|  For the next part it's often better to treat the letters as numbers (A=0, B=1, C=2, ... Z=25)  |7|4|11|11|14|22|14|17|11|3| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |4|0|17|19|7|4|0|17|19|7|  Then you add the numbers in each column together. If you get a number greater than 25, you reduce it by 25 (e.g. 11 + 17 is 28, but you reduce it by 25 to get 3)  |7|4|11|11|14|22|14|17|11|3| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |4|0|17|19|7|4|0|17|19|7| |11|4|3|5|21|1|14|9|5|10|  Then convert back into letters:  |H|E|L|L|O|W|O|R|L|D| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |E|A|R|T|H|E|A|R|T|H| |L|E|D|F|V|B|O|J|F|K|  So your final encrypted message is LEDFVBOJFK",

    "answer": "Kinesiology honors graduate here.   Resistance exercise hypertrophies (makes the heart bigger) the heart due to increased blood flow during lifting along with usage of the vulsalva maneuver, but does not necessarily lead to improved blood flow dynamics and efficiencies. However, resistance exercise has obvious other benefits though such as leading to bigger muscles (good aestetically and for everyday strength) and combating musculoskeletal deficiencies and diseases.  On the other hand, moderate-high intensity cardio exercise is typically seen to lead to improved blood flow efficiencies along with a stronger heart and indicators of increased performance metrics such as improved VO2max which has shown to lead to a higher quality of life.  Both types of exercise have benefits such as improved glucose (sugar) uptake which helps with diseases such as diabetes, has shown to have mental health and motivational benefits, and combats obesity which is related to other diseases. Obviously this is extremely simplified, but that may help you understand why exercise is generally beneficial for health problems.",

    "answer": "There are several reasons, but the principal one is because of the way that the elements form in stars favors even numbered elements over the odd numbered ones, so even at time of creation of the elements, there was a lot more oxygen than fluorine.  In terms of original abundance (if you accept the science on this, which I do for the most part), fluorine was about the same proportion as that of copper (a much larger element), and this is simply due to the way that elements are created during fusion (a lot of fusion is addition of \"helium\" (2 protons) nuclei, so adding 1 proton is much less likely.  On top of that, of course, is that carbon (the reaction of 3 heliums into one atom; the triple alpha process) is a really favorable reaction, and oxygen is just the addition of He to C, so oxygen is almost as common as carbon.",

    "answer": "DC is basically more usable power, as it is continuous: Current flows from the negative pole of a battery, to the positive post of that battery (or whatever parallel/series configuration it has). This means that internal parts don't have to adjust individually, and to boot, it is highly easy to transform AC into DC, via the use of diodes/resistors and often capacitors to deal with the drop in power that comes from the AC source.  AC is easier to transport across large distance, as it basically loses less strength (Voltage) over longer cabling. Even great conductors like copper have some resistance, so that particularity of AC is important. It is also used by most appliances that don't necessarily ***need*** DC, such as refrigerators, or dryers.  Basically you want DC when you need efficiency, you want AC when you want distance, but this is am excessively dumbed down version.  Now, back to your question about your fridge: I strongly recommend against having a 110V plug for a 12V compatible appliance, because you're basically going to break it entirely.",

    "answer": "There are two answers. Neither of them very clear. One personally, and two society-wise. Both depend on risk. The first to your self , the second as a group.   Your risk is based on how likely you are to actually cross paths with someone infectious and how likely that is to cause you serious harm. So are you in an at risk group and where are you are considerations.   The second - how likely you are to be part of a chain of infection, how at risk are the people around you and how well society - such as the health service is coping.   Masks not perfect and life always holds a risk. In the West we have never masked up for flu which kills thousands of people a year - around 20,000 in the U.K. annually I think - though we vaccinate the at risk. Possibly COVId may have some nasty long term consequences even if you dint get seriously ill. But if the consequences of COVID dropped to equivalent to flu , then it would hardly be unreasonable to behave in a similar way. I say that nit to suggest we wait till then ( if it ever happened) but as a comparative starting point. No one can really say at what precise point in infections and consequences between that \u2018flu\u2019 point and the worst of COVID is the point at which we are \u2018safe\u2019.   I expect government ps will come up with a balance of infection rates, hospitalisations and economics with a dose of politics.   Bear in mind that in the East people regularly wear masks on public transport so as either not to do catch viruses or not to spread them , I guess it\u2019s just considered normal hygiene even for colds.   That\u2019s a long winded way of saying that presuming you are not mandated by the governments and pretty much everyone has had access to a vaccine you will have to decide whether you feel either at risk yourself, or feel that you need to still protect other people.

If I give you another point and say that I'm a certain distance away from *that* point as well, you can narrow down where I could be based on the intersection of the two circles.  A third point/distance pair is sufficient to get a single approximate location, and further pairs refine the location further, as well as providing redundancy in case of signal loss.  This is, broadly speaking, the purpose of the pulsar map on the Pioneer plaque (and the Voyager record, as well): fourteen mapped pulsars, with distances and frequencies attached, would give a sufficiently-advanced alien species all the information they would need to locate our solar system in space.",

    "answer": "As a reformed project manager (not civil): unlike in some fields like maybe software, or in infrastructure projects where more of the entire project is _entirely_ under you control (say in building an airport or erecting a new chemical refinery), civil projects have SOOO many pieces going on. And quite a few of them are NOT under your control.   If you work for BP and you're building a new refinery, you've done your environmental compliance assessment, you've lined up your contractors years in advance, you own the land and you don't care about the interruption to your other facilities - you've already dealt with it to as to not interrupt. And if your workers have to go the long way around, well, you're just paying them overtime. THe only one affected is you/your corporation.   Civil projects: well you gotta have public consultations, you have to re-route utilities, redirect traffic, do site work and thousands of other things _before you sink a shovel_. AND, all the things to reverse this are scheduled to happen AFTER the bridge is done. If ANYTHING goes wrong with the actual bridge building, everything gets thrown for a loop. Bus line 207 got re-routed but was scheduled to resume over the bridge next week? The re-route requires six additional bussess per shift, that's six extra drivers, six extra busses. They're needed to backfill the south boulevard re-route because of the new sewer on Ocean st. in a week. If the bridge project takes longer now I need six MORE buses and drivers. Oh and you have no direct control over this, this is the transit planner and they don't like you by the way.   So, you can mitigate a lot of these by having contingnecy plans. But those require resources to be reserved and allocated all of which costs money. I can plan you a project that comes in on schedule but if it has to be able to absorb any and all possibilities itll cost you - you probably won't like it.   A good example: my city was laying a railway underpass. Every day the rail line was disrupted cost the city $XXXXXX.  They're pouring concrete in Febuary... in Canada. The weather was forecast to be good for _that particular week_, but below a certain temperature concrete doesn't set right or it cracks or something (I dunno, Im not civil). So to protect the pour they threw up a big heated tent large enough for the machines and shotcrete trucks. Cost like $1.2M. Oh my god did the peons have a field day with _that_. Never mind that had the bridge not been completed on time (and if the concrete doesn't pour correctly you have to do it over. All of it.) the city would have been paying the railway like $100k per day or more. So $1.2M to protect against what could have been much more than that... seems like a deal to me.   So yeah. Civil projects are a balance between cost and what the city can afford, minimizing interactions with other government departments, minimizing disruption to people, business and traffic. There's lots of communication and inter-dependency and if _anything_ goes wrong (heaven forbid your archeology survey didn't catch an indigenous burial ground) everything else falls apart or falls into some very expensive contingency plans.",

    "question": "ELI5 Why is nuclear energy being pushed as super safe and clean all of a sudden?",
    "answer": "Nuclear energy is by far the most expensive way humans have ever devised to boil water (and turn a turbine). To all those proponents here, some of who work for the industry, I'd simply ask: if nuclear energy is so safe and cheap, why did you all lobby the federal government to take over 100% responsibility for spent nuclear fuel storage? If you factor that cost in, over decades, centuries, and potentially millennia (be honest, you don't really know how long it'll need to be contained), then it is neither cheap nor safe. That's why no one wants to build another Chernobyl, 3 Mile Island, or Fukushima in the modern day.",

    "question": "eli5: Can someone explain employee stock options?",
    "answer": "The company gives you the option to buy stock in the company at a future time, at the price of today (or whenever the options are given to you).  If the stock price goes up, you get to buy the stock at a discount and sell it right away for a profit if you so choose.  You could also just buy and keep it.  If the stock price goes down, you can buy the stock at a higher price than it currently is worth.  This is worthless so if the stock price goes down your stock option has no value.  Effectively its a contract that says you may buy X shares of this companies stock at Y price.  Where Y is the price when the stock options are given to you.",

    "question": "ELI5: Temperature difference in two adjacent rooms?",
    "answer": "if the hallway has no heater, why would it be warm? (especially if it is now pretty cold outside)  If there are truly no heaters and the window is open, the temperature of both rooms should equalize over time to the outside temperature. The door provides some thermal insulation between the rooms and will result in a very slow cooling in the room without the window. If you leave the door open, then the temperature will equalize even faster.  Temperatures within a closed system will equalize over time. That is the law of nature that is called the Second Law of Thermodynamics.",

    "question": "[ELI5] Does my GPS know I\u2019m going to speed?",
    "answer": "The time estimate is updated repeatedly throughout the trip, so if you're moving faster (or other data points change, such as traffic got worse due to an accident), that will get factored into the updated arrival time.   It's not a timer that starts when you leave, but a dynamic report that provides an estimate from the current time and location to the destination.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why does our body take so long to heal a simple cut shouldnt the process be faster to stop more germs from entering?",
    "answer": "This is like asking:  \"why does our body take so long to sleep, shouldn't the process be faster to allow more awake time?\"  or  \"Why does the body take so long to grow to adult size, shouldn't we be full grown sooner to survive better?\"  The answer in all those cases - including your question - is:  \"Well, yeah, that would be great! But the process (healing, sleeping, growing) is spectacularly complicated and the system we have is the best and fastest solution that has evolved...so far.\"  There's a LOT going on with wound healing. Damaged cells die and have to be cleared away, outside bacteria immediately enter cuts and have to be fought, and then the dead bacteria and immune cells also need to be cleared away. New cells of many types have to regrow to replace the damaged tissue, connections and new capillaries need to be formed.  You're right, it would indeed be better if all this happened faster. In the future it may evolve to *be* faster! But it's miraculous that a process this complex happens at all, never mind as fast as it already does. For now, that's the best we can do.",

    "question": "ELI5: How do we think about moving our body without actually moving it?",
    "answer": "Basically, whether or not the signal gets sent from your brain to the limb.  Interestingly, a lot of the brain activity in the brain is similar when we think about something as when we do it.  Might seem kinda obvious, but it goes deeper than you think.  If you scan a musician's brain when they actively listen to music, it will light up in a similar way as when they are *playing* the music.  This is different from someone who doesn't play an instrument listening to it.  Or when you listen to someone speaking, part of your understanding comes from imagining yourself making those sounds, and working out what words you'd be saying if you did that.  This is why you see some people mouthing along as they listen to someone speaking.   Edit: thanks, kind strangers.  Hopefully you meant to actually press the award button, rather than just *thinking* about it...",

    "question": "ELi5: Why is it that household batteries like AA batteries haven\u2019t really changed over the past several decades when most other technology has had significant changes and upgrades?",
    "answer": "Battery technology really haven't advanced much in last 30 years.  Only in the last 5 years have we really seen some interest in the area.    But in the same moment, a AA battery is a known common value. It's voltage, amp-hours and discharge characteristics are well known information.   If we changed the performance of the battery, it would make buying battery's a nightmare. So instead we give new better battery's different names.   Ie. An 18650 is almost identical to an AA in size and shape(but it's a bit longer). But it's voltage and amp hours are double.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why are PS5s still so hard to buy?",
    "answer": "There's an international shortage of processor chips and other hardware needed to make PS5s, partially due to the pandemic interrupting supply chains and causing backlogs at factories that make the parts, but also because a ton of people during the pandemic decided to invest in better home computers (either to farm cryptocurrency or to play video games at home since they were stuck indoors) and there's a shortage of the chips needed to make PS5s as a result.   Likewise, there's not a Sony PS5 factory. Instead, Sony has to rent out the use of a factory ahead of time for, say two weeks, and during those two weeks the factory will make PS5s. The problem is that if it turns out you sold out immediately, then you need to schedule another time in the future to make more PS5s, and you are at the mercy of the factory's schedule for when they will have other openings available.   Sony would LOVE to make more PS5s and sell them all. It's just that a perfect storm of problems is keeping that from happening.",
