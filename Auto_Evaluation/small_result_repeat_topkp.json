    "answer": "Salt is a mineral which can dissolve in water. The water cycle has water evaporating from the oceans and falling onto the land, running back into the oceans eventually. When the water evaporates from the oceans it doesn't take salt with it so what is falling onto the land is fresh water. But as it runs over the rocks and minerals on the land some of the salt will dissolve and go with the rainwater down through streams, rivers, and eventually into the ocean.  Over a long time this means salt tends to move into the ocean, making it salty.",

    "answer": "TL;DR: It's hard to come up with with an exact copy of food and it's easier for companies to create something that is close enough and sells.  So, a recipe is a list of ingredients and the ratios of those ingredients to each other plus a process of how to combine those ingredients.   In order to backwards engineer a food or beverage, you'd need to determine all of the ingredients used and their ratios plus the process.   There are ways to analyze a substance to figure out what's in it.  However, it's cheaper for a company to create a recipe that's close enough to what they are mimicking.   The ingredients are a closely guarded trade secret with only a few people in the company who actually know the recipe.    Even if someone were to figure out the ingredients and their ratios, the process of how the soda is made is also a trade secret.    The process is just as important as the ingredients.

    "answer": "There's a lot of controversy over what causes a side stitch. I've studied it over the years and with well over 200,000 running miles I have plenty of experience. For me, a side stitch comes about from stomach muscles not being synchronized with breathing. Think of it as your chest muscles pulling up as your abdominal muscles pull down. I'm sure that's not technically correct, but that's the effect you experience when the muscles are strained. It can be eliminated/reduced by concentrating on breathing on one side or the other, generally your dominant side. When that foot strikes the ground, you want to be exhaling. Focusing on this will help synchronize the muscles and stop the stitch. There are other causes that increase the likelihood of stitches such as dehydration or stress.",

    "question": "ELI5 How does sound wave energy get converted into electricity and why is it less efficient than solar energy?",
    "answer": "The microphone reflects *a lot* of the sound energy that hits it.  Your simple microphone is like a tiny speaker in reverse where sound hits the diaphragm (little movable plate) and pushes a magnet in and out of a coil of wire.  This little diaphragm is hard on the surface which means that a lot of the sound energy hits it and bounces off rather than being absorbed in pushing the magnet through the coil.  There are little capacitor based ones but the magnet setup is easiest to understand as a reversed speaker.  Solar panels on the other hand are very absorbant of the frequencies they work with.  Some percentage is reflected off the top glass layer but 90% of the light will pass through and then be absorbed down below.  The efficiency of solar panels mostly comes down to the sun emitting light over a wide range of frequencies and our little solar panels only being able to absorb a small range of frequencies which is why the best case efficiency of a single junction solar panel is just 37% because that's the bigger window we can make in the highest energy portion of the sun's spectrum.  Another issue with capturing sound energy is that there just really isn't all that much of it.  If you were to stand 1 meter away from a jet engine its sound level is around 150 dB, but if you were to capture *all* the sound energy from that jet engine it'd be around 1000 W, a 150 dB sound only gives you 1000 W of energy to work with.  You can get that much energy with about 5 m^2 of solar panels and you won't have a giant turbofan engine screaming away in the background.",
    "follow-up": "Gotcha, that makes a lot of sense! So it's a combination of inefficient sound capturing (would need a VERY sensitive diaphragm) and the general low dBs that could be captured.. Would there be some sort of way to boost the dB frequency just before it reaches the diaphragm yet contain it in a way that doesn't actually (noise) pollute the surrounding area? Also is there any possibility to leverage a sort of \"gear reduction\" (obviously not gears themselves, but the principle of reduced effort or whatever) that could amplify the dB level?

To explain in more detail:  The **document** will usually be an XML or HTML document. These are text documents that use markup language to signify different elements:      <p>This is text</p>     <p>This paragraph has a <span>child element</span></p>     <h1>This is a top-level heading</h1>     <img src=\"picture.jpg\" alt=\"This is the alt text for an embedded image\" />  In DOM each element is represented as an **object**. The document itself is an object. Each object can have child objects (the p, h1 and img in the above example are children of the parent document; the span element is a child of the second p element). An object can have also attributes (src and alt are attributes of the img element object; \"This is text\" is the text attribute of the p element object).  Because these markup languages allow for nested (child) elements, the whole thing can be represented as a tree structure, which is the **model**.  Note that the document doesn't have to be a literal file, it can and often does only exist in memory. For HTML, the browser is responsible for parsing the HTML text and building the DOM model in memory. The DOM can then be manipulated by eg. JavaScript but it doesn't change the actual HTML file.

The result is that when you try to open the archive the computer tries to write an absurdly large file to disk. This cannot really damage the computer, it won't destroy data or anything irreversible, but it can be annoying to fill up all remaining drive space.",

    "question": "ELI5: What is this magical amount of enriched uranium that is needed for a nuclear bomb?; Part 2: Why is it that amount?; Bonus: how close is Iran to that amount?",
    "answer": "It's not magic. A nuclear bomb is an engineering device that creates the conditions for an out-of-control nuclear fission reaction.   Each U-235 atom can be split (fissioned) with a neutron. When it splits, it releases 2-3 neutrons of its own (plus some energy). Each neutron can go only a few centimeters before it disintegrates. For a bomb to work, you need those 2-3 neutrons to split more U-235 atoms, which then split more, which then split more, and so on.   If the amount of uranium you have is too small, the neutrons will eventually reach the surface and escape. The chances of them hitting more U-235 atoms will not be high enough to continue the reaction.  So the \"magic amount\" \u2014\u00a0the critical mass \u2014 is the amount of U-235 you need so that you have the conditions where lots of reactions will take place.   The thing of it is, there are different ways to design a bomb. For example, if you put a neutron reflector around the fuel, those neutrons will have a harder time escaping, so you will need less U-235 for it to work. The main bomb design \"trick\" that people use is called implosion, where you use high explosives to squeeze a ball of fuel into a higher density, so the atoms are closer together \u2014 again, to increase the chance of those neutrons finding more atoms.   There are other tricks as well that can be used to increase the efficiency, many of which get beyond ELI5 levels of explanation. The goal of them is to make more material react, which either means you need less material for a given amount of \"boom,\" or you add more fuel and get a bigger explosion.  So the exact amount you need can vary by bomb design. The lower limits are kept pretty secret but it is clear that with 5 kg or even less of material, with a very sophisticated design, you can get a pretty good explosion. For a very crude design, like the one used on Hiroshima (where you are just shooting two pieces of U-235 together), you could need more than 60 kg. So there is a big gap between those two extremes, though in the end even the \"high end\" is not a huge amount.   Separately, with U-235, the level of enrichment (how much U-235 versus U-238 there is) makes a difference to that amount as well. If you have 93% U-235 (7% U-238), you will need less material than, say, 80% U-235 (20% U-238). U-238 inhibits the reaction and so you will need more U-235 to increase the chance of it fissioning.  If this still sounds confusing, you might enjoy playing around with my [Critical Assembly Simulator](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/misc/criticality/), which allows one to simulate in a \"toy\" way how these reactions work. You can tweak the variables (enrichment, total mass, reflection, implosion, etc.) and see how that changes how the reaction operates.   In terms of how close Iran is to the amount, Iran currently has uranium enriched at the level of 20%. That is not enough for a bomb. It is, however, not that far from 90% \u2014\u00a0a lot less far than it seems (enrichment is not linear; it is more \"work\" to go from 0.7% to 20% than it is 20% to 90%).   To make a bomb, Iran would likely need to build up a stockpile of several dozen kilograms of uranium enriched to at least 80%, more favorable at least 90%. They have said that they will make at most 120 kg of 20% enriched uranium. If they turned all of that into 90% enriched uranium with perfect efficiency, they would have around 25 kg of U-235. That would likely be enough for a few implosion bombs (but not enough for a crude bomb). They would also of course have to do the work of weaponizing it, and need a way to actually launch it (missile warheads, etc.) \u2014 not impossible, but these things take additional time and testing.   In terms of \"how close,\" it really depends on what you assume they are going to be doing politically. They do not appear to be trying to make a bomb just yet. They are clearly positioning themselves to make the West uncomfortable, though, with the idea that if they threw everything they had into making a bomb \u2014 which would be a very obvious sort of move, and require them flagrantly violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \u2014 they might be able to make the material in a matter of months.   Note that Iran's uranium stockpiles and facilities are under close scrutiny not only by the International Atomic Energy Agency (which has cameras in each of them, linked back to their headquarters in Vienna), but the intelligence services of many nations (USA, Israel, no doubt others). So this would be a very blatant act. It doesn't mean they couldn't try it (North Korea pulled out of the NPT in 2003, and tested a bomb in 2006), but it is not the kind of overnight \"they suddenly secretly have a nuke\" that many people fear.",

    "question": "ELI5: How come nothing is done for gun control when mass shootings are becoming so frighteningly common ?",
    "answer": "\"Frighteningly\" is an emotional response and it's driven by overwhelmingly biased media coverage. Mass shootings are actually quite rare, and their associated death tolls pale in comparison to things that are otherwise seemingly benign. The biggest reason why gun control measures aren't passed is because liberal politicians that craft the legislation have a fundamental lack of knowledge on how guns are designed/manufactured/operated. Without understanding firearms, the relative proportion of ownership, and how their laws impact the general populace, many (if not most) of their legislative proposals are just terribly written.   I'm an engineer. I solve complicated problems for a living. If you want to apply an engineer's brain to gun legislation it would look something like this:  1) Define the problem. Like *really* define it. All the relevant statistics about deaths, associated circumstances, ownership rates, population densities, gang affiliations, education, gender, income distribution, income inequality in areas of high violent crime, mental health, type of firearm, magazine capacity race, etc. Gather all of it.   2) Use statistical methods to analyze the data. All of the data. Even the bits that make people uncomfortable, like gender/race/religion/income. You analyze all of it.  3) Use the descriptive statistical analyses to characterize gun violence from every conceivable angle.   4) Make some guesses as to what legislative measures we want to implement, based on our observations of the descriptive statistics.   5) Make a predictive model that attempts to predict what would happen if certain parameters were changed (i.e. legal age of ownership, waiting periods, magazine capacities, barrel lengths, no AR's, etc.) and then run them through a predictive model to see what outcomes are achieved.  6) Recognize that the items with the largest impact on outcomes are socially uncomfortable and politically inconvenient to talk about.  7) Stop my research for fear of being ostracized.   8) Do nothing.  9) Buy more guns through private party sales without background checks so that the Fed doesn't know I have them.  10) YEEEEHAAWWWWW",

Hydroponics systems tend to have highly managed biochemistry making sure the plants get exactly the nutrients they need and nothing else. Soil, on the other hand, is a natural environment which contains not only all sorts of minerals and chemicals but also living creatures like bacteria, fungi, even insects. It's naturally balanced to support the plant, but if you disturb that balance (for example, by adding way more water than it would naturally get), it stops being a good environment for plant growth. Minerals could be overextracted or washed away. Organisms could be drowned or could overpopulate and invade. It's simply not managed in the same way a hydroponics system is managed.",

    "answer": "The power sends an alternating electromagnetic signal.  Air has a pretty high resistance to this sort of signal, and so it doesn't go very far or carry much current.  When you put the right loop in the region energized with this signal, it couples with the transmitter to reduce this resistance.  The result allows a lot more current to flow and it's that current that recharges the battery.",

    "answer": "Registers are simply active data storage areas. Nothing particularly fancy about it.  Registers are available in many types of ICs and come in many varieties. For example, you can have status registers, control registers, data registers etc. The reason to give them names is because the function of these registers have to be very carefully explained in the data sheet for the ICs and it is just convenient to give them a name.  Registers are typically not shared (since they are implemented internal to an IC). Unless you are poking deep into the HW and chips (eg writing drivers etc), there is rarely any reason to interact with HW registers (and attempts to change register settings without knowing EXACTLY how they will change the function of the hardware is very unproductive)  Go pick up a few data sheets of some simple control ICs and you can see how they explain register settings etc.",

This means when the stomach is empty, the stomach and oesopagus become irritated and it can lead to throwing up, or feeling we need to throw up.  However, this is not the only reason, just one reason. If eating food like a banana or having antacid medication makes such nausea go away, chances are this is the cause.

    "question": "ELI5: If my VR headset display has a limited and certain amount of pixels, how do games upscale pixel density beyond full resolution?",
    "answer": "I believe you're talking about VR Supersampling. Essential your computer screen (or VR screens in this case) can only output a certain resolution of pixels.(this is called the \"Native resolution\") Each pixel can only display one color at a time. When these pixels do not line up perfectly vertically or horizontally they can look jagged. (Imagine drawing a straight line on MS paint: totally smooth. Now draw a 45\u00b0 angled line: looks like a staircase) This jagged effect is called aliasing. To mitigate this effect, games offer anti-aliasing features such as Supersampling.  Supersampling renders an image at a higher resolution than the computer screen can output, takes an average of the pixel colors in an area and blends them all together, displaying the blended colors at the native resolution. This sort of smooths the edges of those not perfectly straight lines so that they appear less jagged and more natural.   So, your screen is still displaying the same amount of pixels, and the pixels are only displaying one color each, but the colors displayed by each pixel are slightly different.",

Bipolar 1 is extreme highs that classify as full blown manic episodes. These episodes often require hospitalization to avoid harm to the individual and those around them.

    "answer": "The simplest explanation is that dentistry and optometristry are more about tools and minimally invasive procedures than they are about internal biology. They don't actually perform surgery, and if surgery is needed they refer their patients to actual M.D.s to either diagnose more complicated issues or perform surgeries.  They don't need to worry about things that don't involve the procedures they do, and they really only diagnose things that they can see with a quick look(measurement of eyesight/astigmatism, abcess/cavity/etc.) and do what is needed to correct them right then and there, whether it's a root canal or determining the correct lens strength. They don't need to know the workings of the body to do these things, they're only interested in the things that relate to the procedures they do.  They can only use anesthesia if they are trained in it, and it's not only doctors that can use it. If the dentist isn't trained in it, he can have a CRNA that is to administer it.

    "answer": "A 'vegetarian' who eats fish would likely be more aptly called a 'Pescatarian'.    A Pescatarian is someone who eats a vegetarian diet + fish and other seafood, but no meat from other animals.    So if someone says they're on a vegetarian diet, but they eat fish...they aren't actually on a vegetarian diet. A vegetarian diet generally doesn't include *anything* that an animal has to die to provide. So it can include eggs, dairy, etc...but no meat of any kind (fish included).

    "answer": "The number i is \"imaginary\" in the same way negative numbers are imaginary.  You can't have negative sheep in a barn. The whole concept is made-up, but we figured out that if we continue the number line past zero, we can use those made-up numbers in tons of different ways, namely, to represent something that flips between two states. Above freezing vs. below freezing, credit vs. debt, clockwise vs. counter-clockwise, so on.  The number i is just taking that concept further and extending the number line perpendicularly up and down. Like negative numbers, this extension gives us tools to describe a more cyclic kind of flipping: instead of simply going from 1 to -1, we can rotate around 0 by going up to i and then below to -i in between.  The exact applications of that are somewhat obscure and math-heavy, but they pop up in equations modeling many periodic motions and waveforms. Since a sine wave happens in two dimensions, having a number system in place which can work in two dimensions is immensely useful. Fourier transformation, for example, is incredibly common in all kinds of signal handling, and it relies on the complex plane. That's an ELI5 of its own, but [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) has a visual introduction if you're interested in it.",

If \"normal math\", like (1+1) or (73 * 48), I can call 1-dimensional math, then the use of i in complex numbers (a + bi) enables us to do 2-dimensional math?   Would I then be wrong to say: Say I wanted to do math on airplane flying behavior, specifically going forward/back and up/down.. Sure, I could do math on the forward and back (1 dimension), do math on the up and down (1 dimension), and add them up with magic.

    "question": "ELI5: What makes electrons negative and protons positive?",
    "answer": "The choice of electrons as negative was *not* just arbitrary. When early experiments were done before electrons were discovered, it was shown that electricity moves from positive towards negative. This seems counterintuitive at first, because it's the electrons that are moving, right? So electrons are moving from negative to positive, but the *charge* is moving from positive to negative.  Imagine a long line of cars sitting at a red light. When the light turns green, the car at the front of the line moves first. Even though the cars are coming from the back and moving forward, the apparent movement of the *whole line* of cars starts at the front. If you couldn't see individual cars, and they were all the same color, you would see just one long line of *something*. When the first car moves, it would open up a gap or a *hole* behind that car, which the next car would move up to fill. If you were in a helicopter and you had very blurry vision, you'd probably notice that hole appearing to move.  Similarly, when electrons move they leave behind a positively charged \"hole\". Before any electron can move, there has to be a hole in font of it. And when you do math and make models and predictions, you can pretend that the hole acts like a positively charged particle, because it kind of moves around like one. Instead of an electron jumping around, it *looks* like there's a positively charged particle jumping around. Keep in mind that unlike cars, electrons don't slowly travel from one atom to the next: instead, they are around one atom, and then they just *are* at a different atom. They jump across the gap without appearing to move (although they do take time to get there). So without seeing the electrons move individually, it really does look like an overall positive charge is the thing moving.  Thus, early experiments showed that charge came from the end that they labeled as *positive*. After generations, the electron was found but by then the convention was already set, so electrons were stuck as being labeled *negative*. As for why charged particles have charge at all - it's an intrinsic part of the universe and how those particles interact with it. They just kind of...do.",
    "follow-up": "I think I already had this question from before, but it was mostly because of [this video](https://youtu.be/TGUteH93xNo) (at around 3:30) that the question really stuck in my head. There, both negative and positive charges seemed to behave the same, the \"positive particles\" doing what you said about the cars, so I'm guessing the electricity generated was just a positive charge? I'd probably need to learn more about electricity in general to understand it completely",

    "answer": "Billionaires aren't avoiding taxes, so much as paying a small portion of their wealth in taxes because they only liquidate a small amount to live off of, and capital gains taxes are lower than income tax rates.  Let's say I founded XYZ Corp. and I hold shares worth $50B. I take $1/yr in salary. I sell $50M worth of shares each year, and pay capital gains taxes on those. Highest capital gains tax rate is 20%. So if I sell $50M (and assume basically $0 initial cost), then I'd pay $10M in taxes. No matter how valuable my shares become, I only pay taxes when I sell, so if my shares were only worth $25B last year and are now worth $50B , there is no taxable event on that new $25B in wealth.  But wealthy can also borrow money rather than sell off shares, using those shares as collateral. Maybe I borrowed $50M to live off of last year instead of selling shares, paying a low interest rate due to my super low default  risk. Maybe it's 3% annually. Meanwhile, my money in my shares are growing at a much faster rate than that. I can basically keep just paying interest only on amount borrowed, take out new loans, etc. to keep money in my metaphorical pocket without liquidating shares of stock that would require paying capital gains. At some point, I will eventually sell and pay taxes, but presumably have gains on the shares that outweighs the taxes and interest.",

    "question": "Eli5: Convertible notes, how do they really work and what\u2019s the catch?",
    "answer": "Convertible notes are fantastic for startups, especially when things are new or uncertain.  The note buys equity in your company... but not now, it buys it at some point in the future (generally on your next round of funding). Until then its treated like a loan, which generates interest, but you don't pay it off like a loan. It will be \"paid off\" when it becomes equity at that later date in the future for the full value. That is--you never pay out the loan in cash, its paid off in stock, later. Think of it as getting money now, for selling stock in the future.  For example, a convertible note for $50k at 20% means the owner of the company gets $50k now, and will have to give away $50k + 20% interest in equity later.  Lets say in exactly 1 year, you close out the note and give the equity.  You'd give out $60k in equity ($50k + 20% of $50k).  Convertible notes are great when its hard to judge the valuation of a company now, but you will be able to later, it also keeps equity control of the company with the owner and avoid a lot of really complicated financial and legal process of issuing shares.  Convertible notes are often the name of the game for new companies looking to sell equity. Although it doesn't come cheap, rates of 15%-40% are normal.  **tl;dr**: A convertible note gives you money now in exchange for stock in the future",

    "answer": "It is constantly radiating, yes. But the two spheres act like mirrors that focus it back into the core, exciting more fission.  Keeping the spheres separated with a screwdriver just a little bit allows a small amount of that radiation to leak out instead of getting reflected back in. Just enough to keep the core *juuuuuust* below its \"you fucked up\" point.  You could probably think of the demon core like a big steam boiler building up lots of pressure, and the screwdriver holding the hemispheres apart like holding a bleed valve open slightly. You're trying to keep that thing at a very specific pressure close to the boiler's breaking point, because you're trying to measure how the boiler behaves when it's really close to failure. But if you slip and lose grip on the bleed valve, pressure will build up almost instantly and the boiler will explode, killing you.  The demon core wouldn't actually explode like the nuclear bombs you think of, though. It would mostly just flash very hot very briefly. But in that instant it will have poisoned you with enough radiation to have you dead within two weeks of the incident. Three people have already died this way.",

    "answer": "What you're seeing is called a vapor cone, and it is *not* inherently related to supersonic flight.  All that's happening is that you have shock waves and expansion fans caused by the hard surfaces of the aircraft as it moves through the air; the shockwaves compress the air (causing the water in the air to condense into a visible cloud), and then the expansion fan rapidly returns the compressed air to ambient(ish) conditions (causing the water to evaporate again).  It's generally a sign of a plane entering the *transonic* regime (e.g. Ma 0.7 to 0.9), but while it's an indication that a plane is certainly traveling fast, it's not necessarily evidence that they've actually hit Ma 1.0 or higher.",

But it turns out if you push past a certain limit with enough force it does eventually compress.   Speed of \"sound\" is a bit of a misnomer. It actually means the point air starts compressing. It is not a constant like the speed of light but can vary wildly with temperature according to gas laws.  Compressed air forms a shockwave.  Remember Sound is just waves of expanding/retracting air. If the air is squeezed into a shockwave you won't hear it because it's it is not a wave of expanding/retracting air but a wall of compressed solid air. The Sonic boom heard is actually the slower air behind the wave, expanding and retracting.  So inside the shockwave, the air is squeezed so much to be near solid, it squeezes out all the particles in the air including all the water molecules which then condense around the shockwave to form \"clouds\".",

    "answer": "Fundamental conceptually innaccurate understanding of light. Light has no speed.  If youre reading a blank book, but letters appear on the page as soon as you turn the page and can see them. Do they have a speed?  They appear at the speed you turn the page, not of their own innate properties. This is not a 'speed' but a characteristic defined by something else.    ELI5; Light doesnt move. It exists everywhere along its path as soon as its created. What you call speed of light, is the maximum speed we can change something in the universe. The speed of causality.  Because light exists everywhere along its path, theres nothing to slow down. Thats your answer.      ELI15; This is a fundamental conceptual misunderstanding. All the documentaries, science books etc would do well to change \"speed of light\" to \"speed of causality\" per Einstein.  Light does not travel in the sense we think about.  Light exists in a line along its path immediately upon being created.  When someone says light speed is X, what they mean is the speed of causality is X. The speed at which anything can experience a change in information.  So you might say? Well, isnt that the same? No, because light exists immediately along a trajectory, it doesnt have a mass to slow down. It isn't moving like how we innately understand movement.  Counter to this is light slowing in a medium. Dont be confused. 2 different mediums are being discussed. One medium actually slows causality. The other medium does not slow causality.  1. Light appears slower in a gravity well, this is a type of medium. This is because causality slows. The rate at which our reality can experience a change in data slows.  2.  Light appears to slow in a crystal or other object, because it physically interacts, is absorbed, re-emitted. Basically bounces around causing it to \"appear slowed\" . This is a different kind of medium. The reaction at the quantum level results in the added time not light traveling.",

    "question": "ELI5: How bad actually are the long term effects of alcohol, marijuana and acid for example, on younger people?",
    "answer": "Drugs damage you mainly on two fronts.  Alcohol is dangerous, because it destroys your body. It is a highly potent toxin and in the process of removing it the body hurts itself. Not as much as you would notice, but over years of constant use, everybody can see the difference to a non-drinker. So alcohol basically decays you slowly.   For the specific scenario of drinking every couple of months it will probably take a lot of time until noticeable defects show themselves, but you will be at higher risk for things like liver failure, than someone who doesn't drink.  Acid or LSD is a psychoactive drug. It is heavily dependent on the psyche of the user, to what happens after consuming it. It may be depicted as one of the more harmless drugs, but that appearance is deceptive. Any psychoactive drug and especially LSD has the potential to cause a psychosis any time you consume it.  So if someone, especially with a developing brain would take LSD, even if it only were every couple of months, that development could be stunted and will be influenced. A higher chance for a permanent psychosis is guaranteed here.   Cannabis is the mixed bag of drugs and widely inconsistent, not only the drug itself, but also how it is consumed.  You can eat, smoke or inhale it, and with pure THC you have even more possibilities. Todays Cannabis also has hundreds if not thousands of different strains that all vary in in drug composition and strength. There are hundreds of cannabinoids in cannabis and they all interact and influence the trip.  So first we have the way to consume it. A vaporizer is the safest way, since it allows you to release the cannabinoids without burning the Cannabis and releasing harmful smoke and byproducts. Then you have eating, where your body has the chance to clean out anything it doesn't want in there, but you consume the whole plant. Lastly smoking fills your lung with additional toxins and kills your bronchi.  Then the drug itself has the same potential of any psychoactive drug to cause psychosis. Cannabis itself has been shown to impact short-term memory and especially trigger underlying conditions of schizophrenia., especially in developing brians.  For your scenario, you would notice differences between someone who never smoked and someone who consumed Cannabis. The damages to short-term memory are permanent and will stunt the development of the brain.  &#x200B;  Lastly, it has to be said that drugs are never safe. You can safely trip on acid ten times and then take a lower dose the eleventh time and still have negative side effects. Our body is far too complicated and these drugs have a tremendous impact on our whole body chemistry every time we consume them, to reliably say what they would cause every time.",

This is because oceans are not, in fact, particularly hot. They tend to be roughly the temperature of the air above them, on the surface, and colder beneath. A lot of would-be heat is carried off by evaporation at the surface.  So, with water that's actually *colder* than the surrounding air, you're not going to be able to power much of anything off of that water's heat.

A strong digestive tract prevents this.  Between the cells that line your intestines, you have something called tight-junction. When your tight-junction become damaged, they allow gaps to form between the cells of your intestines.  Then, bacteria and molecules from foods that you eat can enter into your bloodstream, which will cause a heightened immune-state.  Your immune system starts attacking a lot more things because it's always on high alert because of potential toxins floating around in your bloodstream.   I used to have bad pollen allergies. Watery eyes and constant sneezing. It last for a few years. Then one year I started intermittent and long-term fasting. I stopped having allergies that year.  Then I switched to a keto diet, and remain unaffected by pollen. But if I start eating a lot of junk food and crap during allergy season, my eyes start itching again .  Certain foods damage the tight junction in your digestive tract. You can test the permeability of your intestines with the PEG400 test. You drink a solution, and then find out how many particles from that solution end up in your pee. It's supposed to be 0, but if it's above 0 then it means the particles have crossed into your bloodstream, and then were filtered through your kidneys.",

So the big deal is that we either need to spend much more money to purify water, we need to use less water, or we need to be prepared to die as a civilization because we refuse to do either of those two.

    "question": "ELI5: Can Journalist Interview Wanted Criminals and Fugitives?",
    "answer": "We as a sociaty do want journalists to be able to freely talk to criminals so that we can get a fair view of the world we live in. We therefore grant journalists the same rights as doctors and priests to not have to disclose secrets about crimes and criminals. This is so that the criminals can be able to trust these people with secret information. There is of course limits to this right and journalists can not be part of a crime or in a possition where they can prevent the crime from taking place. There may also be more specific laws depending on the legislation.  It does not mean that it is easy for journalists to find criminals to interview.  There is a reason wanted criminals have not been caught. So a journalist might need some time to gain the confidence of the criminal networks they are making a story about. Investigative journalism takes a lot of time because of things like this. You might even see the journalist having to publish whatever they have and first then start to gain the confidence of the people higher up. Trust also goes both ways and the journalist have to make sure that the criminals are who they say they are and that they will not do harm to them. Journalists have been kidnapped or even killed when investigating criminals they trusted. It is also common for journalists to get a lot of information that they can not publish yet because it would be unfair to the criminals involved. So an article or a documentary might have to sit on the shelf for months or even years before it can be published.

    "question": "ELI5: What happens when there's too much honey in a bee hive but there's no one to collect it?",
    "answer": "They call this condition \"honeybound\"  Queens need open cells to lay eggs... If a colony becomes too cramped in their hive they will create a new set of queens and all the oldest bees and the old queen fly away to start a new hive in some other new space.. the young bees remain behind taking care of the new queens and new baby bees... the new queens have fatal duels until only one remains... typically if the first queen to emerge is healthy she will be allowed to go kill the other queens  before they escape their cocoons... if the best queen is slow to emerge workers will protect that area from a lesser but quicker to emerge queen who would certainly eliminate that better competition given the opportunity.  If the space is extremely cramped or the colony exceptionally populous, they may also send a couple more swarms with newly emerged queens rather than having them duel down to one...  Ideally the best new queen takes the original colony... the old queen starts up a new hive elsewhere... if they're especially fortunate 2-3 minor swarms with new queens also begin anew.  Those minor swarms do not have great odds of survival but sometimes nature finds a way.  Update: thanks so much for all the gifts and goofy comments you all made my day = )  I've only been a bee keeper for a single season, but I take that responsibility seriously so I've tried my best to learn as much as I can so I can be a proper steward of my lil beebies.  I wouldn't call myself an expert by any means but I tell myself to learn like I'll live forever and serve like there's no tomorrow. I try to spend at least a little chunk of time learning more about bees everyday! They're fascinating and I'm a biologist so it's really a joy to learn all about them!  I'd like to encourage anyone and everyone who isn't allergic to work with bees and learn about them and help local bee keeper or become one yourself!  They're marvelous creatures and truly altruistic... working with them has been extremely rewarding and fulfilling... the hardest part is waiting for winter to pass.  As for how the bees select their favored queen? I guess that's one of their secrets, I only know about it because I've seen the way some workers guard their favorite unopened queen cell. I could scratch up a few paragraphs of ideas about factors that go into it but I'm already rambling hahaha... likely there is a lot to it.  Thanks again guys support local bee keepers and get your hands in the mix, most bee keepers are old timers and the industry needs more youthful energy and innovation!",

Historically, the SCOTUS has struck down laws like this that were overly restrictive, but in this case (in a 5-4 decision) the decided reject an emergency injunction - meaning the law is in effect until the larger case is heard.

A cult is a religious organization based on control, who uses that control to remove negative influence about the cult towards the members to exert control over the belief system and remove rational thought about it.  Normal beliefs have a cycle to their creation:  1.  Idea - what is the thesis?  2.  Positive reinforcement - what are all the thoughts that support the idea?  3. Negative reinforcement - what are all the things that go against the thesis and make it not true?  4.  Reflection - weighing the positive against the negative in reflective thought  5.  Belief - what is your conclusion after considering the thesis from other angles and hearing from multiple perspectives on the issue.   Cults remove #3 and because of that you have no negative reinforcement. No negative and there is only positive going into reflection. So you get a fast track to belief.

Imagine we had two balls - one filled with polystyrene balls from a bean bag, the other fillled with steel ball bearings.  We spin both balls faster and faster.  The one with the ball bearings will deform sooner.  The  bulge will appear sooner and it will flatten into a disc sooner.  The more mass you're spinning  the less revolutions per minute you need to turn it into a disc.        And galaxies are spinning a *lot* of mass.           ^(Edit: fixed a spelling error)",

    "question": "ELI5 We all hear that the healthcare industry in the US is really screwed up, but why? How did it come to be this way and what can reasonably be done to make it more fair and affordable for the general public?",
    "answer": "The medical industry, and specifically the medical insurance industry is very heavily regulated.  Also the US norm of having insurance tied to your job creates problems.  A solution would be to decouple insurance from employment.  If your employer provides benefits, there\u2019s a \u201ctotal compensation\u201d number somewhere on the books.  Like if your salary is 50k plus benefits, it\u2019s likely costing the company 75k to employ you.  Instead of the company providing insurance, if the compensation became just pay you 75k, but no benefits, with a more open market option for health insurance, like there is for home or auto insurance, more options could emerge.  You\u2019re someone young and healthy with no kids? Sure, here\u2019s a plan that is dirt cheap, but doesn\u2019t cover much beyond catastrophic accidents/illness.  You\u2019re married and have 3 kids? Here\u2019s a plan that costs a bit more and covers more.  You\u2019re a hypochondriac that\u2019s constantly convinced you\u2019re dying?  Here\u2019s a plan that covers everything imaginable, but you\u2019re going to have to pay a lot for it.  Another option is tort reform for lawsuits.  High risk medical fields like OB, surgeons, etc have to carry enormous levels of malpractice insurance and liability.  If they\u2019re in private practice, premiums can run into the 6 figures.  This decreases the amount of people willing to assume that level of risk, meaning shortages.  Any time there\u2019s a shortage, price goes up.  So reducing the ability to sue a doctor for millions of dollars for something that isn\u2019t blatantly their incompetence (like an injury to mom or baby when giving birth, even if all protocols and good practices were followed) could help too, because then there\u2019d be lower risk to such fields and more people would want to go into them, meaning wait times and price could go down.",
    "follow-up": "Thanks for taking time to respond! Not trying to come across as ignorant because I genuinely don\u2019t know, but isn\u2019t the purpose of your employer covering insurance for you because they\u2019re a large corporation and have the leverage to negotiate with insurance companies for better rates? I get that health insurance might be more affordable for employed people who work for a corporation, but maybe not for the self-employed or unemployed folks. Is there a solution to make it affordable for all?",

But you know, we're the best country, obviously...  Edit with more info:  Many people also rely on Medicaid, which is a type of state funded health insurance. But it's limited to specific groups of people and can vary greatly from state to state.  A lot of people do die because of a lack of access to healthcare.

    "answer": "They don\u2019t. Hospitals can\u2019t turn away living saving care, regardless of financial situation. They treat the patient, send them an outrageous bill and, because it\u2019s outrageous and affects credit they don\u2019t have anyway, they let it lapse. To offset this, hospitals jack up prices to have insurance or more economically stable citizens cover the difference.. except as prices get higher, insurance gets higher and the amount of people that can afford the bills get smaller. More people fall into the category that can\u2019t pay the hospital bill. So, to cover the difference, prices go up, insurance goes up, and the amount of defaulted medical bills go up.   Rinse lather repeat.  And this is why it costs $1500 just to go into the ER. Then they star giving you $800 saline bags for hydration, $500 Tylenol, $200 for the bandaid after they drew blood. You\u2019ll get the $700 lab work bill separately. A doctor walked past you once so that\u2019s $500. You paying that $3200 bill that didn\u2019t actually treat you? Or are you going to be one of the people that lets it default and add to the price hike?   This is almost exactly what happened when my husband\u2019s herniated disc flared up and his pain doctor couldn\u2019t see him for a few days. He couldn\u2019t move! He just need some light pain pills to get him through two days. He brought his records, explained the situation and stressed it wasn\u2019t muscular so he didn\u2019t need steroid shots. He just needed a small script of pain medication to get him through two days.  They gave him steroid shots which put him in more pain and tried doing X-rays on him. We left in a worst place we came in on and with a $1700 bill. They tried sending us another $800 bill for  reasons They said as doctor *looked* at his paperwork\u2026We didn\u2019t pay it.

    "question": "ELI5: Why do we need so much ram in cell phones?",
    "answer": "Computers actually use a lot more memory than just their RAM. They also set aside a portion of your disk drive(s) called a \"swap file\". If something happens and RAM gets a little low, the OS finds some portions of RAM that haven't been used lately and transfers them to the \"swap file\". That frees up RAM for what it was doing. Disks are a LOT slower than RAM, so that's why an overloaded computer gets visibly slower: it can be in a state where EVERYTHING involves moving something to or from the swap file. So long as you don't run out of disk space, you can at least run with diminished performance.  (My laptop has 16GB of RAM. It's using 12.3 of it. I'm also using 32MB of swap file, which means I'm doing pretty well right now!)  Phones don't have big disk drives to lean on for swap files. It's only recently that they've had more than about 32GB of storage to work with. If they used some of that storage for swap files, people would be mad that they can't store as many photos, apps, or songs on their phones. Further, the kind of memory they use for their \"disks\" can actually wear out if you write data to it too much. That can take years on modern devices, but it'd be a lot faster if a swap file was constantly writing to the storage!  What happens when a phone runs out of RAM then? Well, the app said it needed some memory to do something and there's no memory. So it can't do anything. If you think about it, it can't even show you an error message! To show you an error message, it'd have to get some memory to store the message. But the phone just told it there IS no memory! So the app crashes. The phone OS tries to deal with this by closing apps you've put in the background. (This is also why having 2 apps open at once is such a restricted feature that took so long to arrive.) It hopes if you haven't looked at some app in a month you won't mind if it takes longer to start up next time.   So the best solution is to put more RAM in the phone. That means not just that the phone can run bigger things, it means it can run *more* things without having to force apps to quit. That also means phones need more RAM to do the same things as PCs.",
    "follow-up": "Interesting point, I thought the newer disks (SSD or flash storage) has a controller that balances write operation so that no segment is written too many times to wear out sooner. So it should be okay to use swap files on phones, no?",

    "question": "ELI5: what is a non-linear partial differential equation?",
    "answer": "Since I have no idea what your level of background knowledge is, I\u2019m going to just break down the whole phrase.  Let\u2019s start with *differential equation*.  \u201cDifferential\u201d is calculus-speak for \u201cchange\u201d, or \u201crate of change\u201d.  A *differential equation* is an equation, or a math statement, that tells you how fast something is changing, in terms of other things. A classic example is unrestrained bacterial cell division. Given sufficient space and resources, every bacteria cell can divide into 2 new cells each \u201ccycle\u201d (t). So if we have 2 cells, we gain +2 cells each cycle. If we have 10 cells, we gain +10 cells. In general, if we have *Y* cells, then we gain *Y* cells every cycle. In calculus speak:  > dY / dt = Y  where dY / dt means \u201chow fast Y is changing each cycle (t). This is also called a *derivative* or a *differential*, making this a *differential equation*.  What about a *Partial* differential equation?  The \u201cpartial\u201d means that there is more than 1 other variable that is going to affect things. In the above example, we only cared about how many bacteria would grow *per cycle*, or per unit of time. In calculus speak: we took the derivative of Y *with respect to* time (or \u201ccycle\u201d). What if the bacteria were growing along a wall, and bacteria at one end of the wall had more food and could grow faster than those at the other end of the wall? Now Y, the number of bacteria, depends not only on how much time has passed (t), but what position along the wall we are (x). So, we can take the *partial* derivative \u2202Y/\u2202t, but we *also* need to take the partial derivative \u2202Y/\u2202x to get the whole picture. ~~Note, these \u201cd\u201ds are usually lowercase Greek deltas when referring to partial derivatives.~~  Finally, *non-linear* refers to the exponents in the equation itself. \u201cLinear\u201d means variables are only raised to the first power and aren\u2019t multiplied together. Our first example was linear, because the right side of the equation only has Y raised to the first power. If the number of bacteria along this wall changes by the *square* of the number of bacteria for each incremental step along the wall, we have  > \u2202Y/\u2202x = Y^2  Which is a nonlinear partial differential equation.  EDIT: made some corrections based on comment below by u/angrious, including updating the partial derivative symbol to the correct one and changing the final equation to actually be non-linear.",

    "question": "ELI5 - Do Dry Rocks Respond Differently Than Wet Rocks?",
    "answer": "The effects of moisture on rocks very much depends on the type of rock. If it's porous like sandstone or limestone then it will become denser from absorbing it and possibly explode if exposed to high heat.  In regards to brittleness, water has very little to do with it as it's based on the strength of the bond between particles in the stone. If there's water soluble minerals then it can definitely weaken it, but those are very rare since water likely had already been through it (at least on earth)  There is a slight effect that water can have on rocks that break concoidally (aka like glass). Water filling any voids in the stone can allow cracks to propagate more easily. This trick is used by flint knappers to make some rocks easier to work with when making arrow heads/knives",
    "follow-up": "> In regards to brittleness, water has very little to do with it   I dunno, I think water often plays a significant role in how brittle rocks are or not. I get where you\u2019re coming from \u2014 the intrinsic factor is to do with atomic bonding in the minerals which make up the rock, and (if sedimentary) the particular medium which cemented it during lithification.   Certain other factors of the environment that the rock finds itself in are also important though. Most obvious would be the pressure and temperature conditions: higher temperatures encourage many deformation and/or transport mechanisms on the atomic scale as they are essentially all temperature dependent (things like Coble creep, grain boundary diffusion, Nabarro\u2013Herring creep, grain rotation etc) which are the ways that solid crystalline materials (like rock) can deform in a ductile manner without fracturing. Higher pressures help confine the rock in all directions, so it\u2019s less likely to rupture/fracture. So as you go deeper in the crust, you get increases in both temperature and pressure until you get about 15 km down and you\u2019re in the brittle-ductil transition zone. Much further and it will only be ductile deformation occurring, no fracturing at all.   The other important factor is water. You are right that water is not going to change the physical properties of the minerals themselves unless it\u2019s a water soluble mineral (and thus gets eroded) or one which can take up water into its crystalline structure. Now, although water does not enter the crystalline structure of other minerals (which is the vast majority of minerals), it generally generally reduces the brittle strength as a result of adsorption: water as a pore fluid decreases the surface energy, promotes crack growth and stress corrosion *without the rock having to reach the critical stress points.*  Having said all that, the exact result of more water being present as a pore fluid will depend on all the factors combined \u2014 what is the type of stress and the rate of stress being applied? What are the temperature and pressure conditions? What type of rock is it and what is its overall porosity and permeability? Is the pore space evenly distributed or very heterogeneous? So it\u2019s definitely not a straightforward question, but I think more often than not, the addition of water increases the amount of brittle deformation going on.",

A simply infantry company has very limited abilities, an entire Marine Corps division brings their own tanks, infantry, air defence, combat engineers etc.   - The same applies to the different level of trauma centres. They start from very small units (level 5) with limited medical capabilities, perhaps not even open 24/7, but these units are cheap, easy to setup and maintain. And for many injuries and incidents they are enough.  - The largest and most resource intensive of them (level 1) of course are very expensive, require much more staff, are open 24/7, have many different capabilities to investigate heal and treat injuries, diseases and take care of patients.

    "question": "ELI5: Why do gas prices include the extra 9/10 cent on the end?",
    "answer": "That is an ancient consumer marketing technique. A very long time ago, people in marketing figured out that consumers perceive a price of, say, $1.99 to be significantly less than a price of $2.00. Of course, those prices are not actually very different, but people tend to round down to the nearest significant digit rather than rounding up when they are purchasing consumer goods. The same is true for something like refrigerators: buyers will look at a fridge that costs $1199 and one that costs $1200, and they will express a preference for the slightly cheaper one regardless of any benefits the slightly more expensive one may possess. Psychologically, that $1 difference between 1199 and 1200 is very impactful. Now, let's change the prices of those refrigerators to, say, $1286 and $1288. Now people will look at the two refrigerators and perceive them both as being essentially the same price (which they are) because the significant digit  - 2 - is the same. For that very same reason, both refrigerators could increase in price to $1289, or even $1299, and nobody would even care. If the price creeps to $1300, the significant digit has changed and people start to think they're being hornswoggled.   The 9/10 thing is related to that behavior. Consumers ignore the 9/10 and focus on the pennies because that's the significant digit in a gasoline price. This effectively allows oil companies to charge an extra .9 cents per gallon of gas without you even realizing it.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why does your brain expect pain, is it a beneficial process?",
    "answer": "The short answer is an idea called [predictive coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding). The sights, sounds, bodily feelings, smells, tastes, and thoughts/feelings that we experience as we go about our day are based partly on prediction. Here's a [quote](https://aeon.co/essays/the-hard-problem-of-consciousness-is-a-distraction-from-the-real-one):   \"\\[...\\] the brain is a prediction machine \\[...\\] Think of it like this. The brain is locked inside a bony skull. All it receives are ambiguous and noisy sensory signals that are only indirectly related to objects in the world. Perception must therefore be a process of inference, in which indeterminate sensory signals are combined with prior expectations or \u2018beliefs\u2019 about the way the world is, to form the brain\u2019s optimal hypotheses of the causes of these sensory signals \u2013 of coffee cups, computers and clouds. What we see is the brain\u2019s \u2018best guess\u2019 of what\u2019s out there. \\[...\\] In this view, which is often called \u2018predictive coding\u2019 or \u2018predictive processing\u2019, perception is a controlled hallucination, in which the brain\u2019s hypotheses are continually reined in by sensory signals arriving from the world and the body.\"   How do you know you almost hit your throat on the metal bar? I'm guessing that you know this based on sight. When given the sight of a metal bar as sensory input, the brain made a prediction: this is a hard metal object that will cause pain if it hits the body. Visual parts of the brain then sent a signal to predictive parts of the brain, which sent a signal to parts of the brain that feel pain. The feeling of pain was a prediction, and what you noticed was a prediction error. Prediction errors are usually surprising and easily catch attention. How exactly predictions are made about pain remains an area of active research ([source](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/843284v1.full)), but this is one idea. I don\u2019t know why this question got downvoted, since it\u2019s a really great question that gets into some deep neuroscience.  Edit: also, another example of predicted pain is the [rubber hand illusion](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sxwn1w7MJvk). If you use sensory input to trick the brain into perceiving a rubber hand as part of the body, suddenly hitting the rubber hand with a hammer will cause a feeling of pain as a prediction. One part of the brain involved is the [anterior cingulate cortex](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26518-x).",

So you have to guess a \\*huge\\* number of potential answers and that takes time...whoever gets a correct guess first gets awarded with some cryptocurrency as a \"thank you\" for their efforts (in proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin).  Suppose I pick a random-ish number, like what's currently on your odometer. Let's say is 69420. My simple/stupid mining problem might be \"Find a number that you can add to 69420 so that the last four digits are 0000\". You can (hopefully) fairly quickly see that there are multiple solutions, and they're not that hard. 580 will work (69420+580=70000), 10580 will work (80000), etc. You can solve this one with middle school algebra, which means a computer can do it basically instantly.  Let's pick a harder problem...start with our random-ish number, but now my mining problem is \"What is the value of that digit of pi?\". So, in our example, what's the 69,420th digit of pi? Assuming you don't have a list of the digits of pi available, the only way to figure that is to actually calculate the 69,420th digit. That takes time, but still not nearly long enough for a practical mining problem.  That's the basic idea behind mining, we just use a harder math problem so it takes longer.",

    "answer": "Pure math problems can be simple to state but very hard to show that they are true. The problem tends to be general in nature so you can't just test all alternatives  A famous example is Fermat's Last Theorem stated in 1637  It states that a\\^n +b\\^n = c\\^n do not have an integer solution for n >2  Finding a solution of n=1 is trivial because a number to the power of 1 is itself so 1^1+1^1=2^1 => 1+1=2  It is alos easy to find a solution for n=2    3^2+4^2=5^2 => 9+16=15  The problem is now how do you show that there is not a solution for n>2?  If you just test different options you can only show that there is not a solution for the one you have tested. You can test a lot of numbers on a computer but the number you have tested will always be limited.  If you like to test it for a b and n less than 1 billion you start to reach calculation time for a computer longer than the age of the universe. Even if you could do that calculation how do you know there is not a solution when some number are in the trillions?   There is an infinite number of integers so it is impossible to test all alternatives.  So to show the statement is true you need to discover a lot of maths and in 1995 ane 129 pages long proof was published by Andrew Wiles. So it took 358 years until a mathematical proof fo that statement was possible",

    "answer": "A fundamental wave has three properties:   - Amplitude. How much the wave varies from high to low.   - Frequency. How often the wave repeats.   - Phase. How much the start of the wave is offset from time 0.  You can sum up any number of different fundamental waves to get a composite signal. You can also de-construct that composite signal into its component waves.  Now, we want to encode a message into our wave. The way we do this is by varying one or more of the amplitude, frequency or phase of the wave.  For example, the most basic form of modulation is Amplitude Modulation - the basis of AM radio. This is an analog system where the changing amplitude of our wave can be read as another wave - a wave that encodes the information we want.  Most modern communications is built off of variations of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation, where you use fixed variations of frequency/amplitude/phase to encode digital values (4 in the case of 'Quadrature', although more complex systems exist).",

Yes, absolutely.

A fever is *caused* by whatever \"bad\" stuff has gotten into you triggering your immune system to tell your brain to heat up your body. So, when all the bad stuff dies, your immune system stops telling your brain to heat up. This is what's happening when a fever \"breaks\" without medical intervention.",

Some of them might be orbiting almost vertically, while others are orbiting more horizontally.

First off, I think it\u2019s important to note that there are different types of deadlifting, but between conventional and sumo, deadlifts use %85 of muscles in your body when done correctly.   As already noted above, hips and knees drive the movement, and the load is shared throughout %85 the body (at different times throughout the movement). ~%45 of this should be your core, as it should be engaged the entire lift (many people don\u2019t realize this)!  The part of deadlifts being a compound leg exercise is predominantly the moment between picking up the bar from the ground, and performing the hip hinge.

    "answer": "Here's the current understanding of it:  When the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs hit, it smacked into the earth and ejected a bunch of rock, knocking a lot even up into space around earth.  This came falling back down all around the planet, and as it entered the atmosphere it started to heat up from re-entry, heating the air around it as well.  All over the planet, for hours, the sky above was red hot, glowing like an oven....and cooking anything on the surface of the earth...this would have caused massive wildfires as well.  Then, after this deadly pulse of heat, massive amounts of dust in the upper atmosphere would have blotted out the sun, cooling the earth and making it hard for plants to grow.  Only years later did the planet regain some sort of equilibrium, but by this time a mass extinction had wiped out many species and ecosystems were really out of whack.  So what does this have to do with crocodiles?  Well, if we look at patterns of extinction on land, what we see is that basically all the species that survived on land were smaller than about a kilogram...small enough to hide under something and avoid being baked to death during the first stage.    Crocs are much bigger than that, of course...but they live in streams.  _Stream_ life actually had an easier time than purely terrestrial animals.  Not just crocodiles, but turtles and amphibians too.  Why?  For one thing, when the sky turns boiling hot it helps to be able to dive under water.  And while food chains on land mostly depend on green and growing plants to survive,  food chains in streams often depend on detritus falling into streams...leaves fall into streams, bugs break down the leaves, fish eat the bugs, crocs eat the fish.  This means that during the aftermath of the impact, when nearly everything on land was dead or dying, freshwater ecosystems were better able to sort of limp along until things recovered, living on fallen plant matter, etc.  A lot of species still died...but they didn't _all_ die like all the (non avian) dinosaurs did.",

    "answer": ">Does that mean that as the pressure increases, a substance becomes more gaseous?  No. The opposite. The higher the pressure, the more likely the fluid will become liquid or even solid.  For the water example, you're trying to get the vapor pressure of the water to match the ambient pressure. If you're increasing the pressure, you're not increasing the vapor pressure, but the ambient pressure. You can only increase the vapor pressure of the water by heat. So if you increase the pressure in the container, like a pressure cooker, water must heat up further before it can boil; the vapor pressure has to go even higher than usual in order for it to meet the ambient (within the pressure cooker) pressure.  The same thing happens in the other direction for carbon dioxide. When the ambient pressure increases, the vapor pressure of the carbon dioxide is staying the same. Once the ambient pressure is higher than the vapor pressure, the carbon dioxide begins to condense into liquid; it is now below its boiling point.",
    "follow-up": "I heard on a podcast that putting a lid on a pot helps it boil because it increases the pressure.

    "question": "ELI5: The BN (o) passport for HK was in the news this week. Can someone tell me what this is?",
    "answer": "I will preface this wall of text by saying that I am very much in favor of the 2019-2020 protests, so please read this text with that in mind.  British National (Overseas) was a scheme originally implemented in the 80s/90s. As the handover from the UK to the PRC of Hong Kong was being discussed, there was a concern that HKers born in a British colony/territory would be forcibly stripped of protections they had as nominal British subjects. To counteract that, the UK proposed that everyone born in HK prior to a certain date would be eligible to be a BN(O), or British National (Overseas). This would give them some consular protections as a British subject, but not full citizenship rights. The idea was to allow those who did not want to live under the PRC to emigrate as if they were British citizens. Many did, finding homes in other ex-British territories like Australia and Canada. However, the handover agreement promised 50 years of autonomy to the HK government from the PRC, which eased many people's minds about remaining in HK or returning to HK after the handover.  This is being revived now in light of the anti-government/pro-democracy protests that started in 2019. The crackdown by the pro-PRC HK government, culminating in the 2020 National Security Law (NSL) forced by the PRC onto HK, was not favorably received by the UK and other western nations, being seen as a violation of the handover agreement that the UK had signed with the PRC in 1984. The revival of BN(O) is supposed to be a recourse from the UK to HKers; since the PRC isn't allowing HKers the 50 years of autonomy that they owed them, the UK will again extend the offer to emigrate from HK with much loosened restrictions. I am not certain on the details, but the eligibility has been greatly expanded compared to the original BN(O) offer.  The PRC has counteracted by not recognizing these BN(O) documents as travel documents. This is a bit of a hollow move, as most (if not all) HK residents have HK/PRC travel documents. They would simply use HK documents to pass through emigration controls in HK when departing, then use their BN(O) documents to enter the other country.  There are a few cases where someone who has been arrested for participating in the protests or violating the NSL and has had to surrender their HK/PRC travel documents as part of their bail/arrest conditions. These people would be most impacted by the lack of BN(O) recognition, as they would have no valid travel documents. However, since they are on bail, they would most likely be denied boarding/emigration anyway.  It matters now because many of the protests have currently been silenced, both by the NSL and by the pandemic, both in terms of legal restrictions (lockdowns, curfews, public gathering limits/bans) and public health concerns. Since many of those who have protested are unable to do so safely, the next available option for them is to simply emigrate if they no longer want to live under that government.",

    "question": "ELI5: Why can't we just make water by smooshing hydrogen and oxygen atoms together?",
    "answer": "We CAN.  Now, it's not very often in nature you come across pure hydrogen and pure oxygen.  But if you do have pure hydrogen and pure oxygen and you put them together in the right ratio, it's very easy to get them to form water.  In fact, it's hard to PREVENT them from forming water.  It's a common 9th grade science experiment, you run electricity through water in a certain way and one electrode has bubbles of pure oxygen forming on it and the other pure hydrogen.  You catch each in their own test-tube. You combine the two.   A very small spark will cause them to smoosh together and form water.  Thing is, sometimes you don't even need a spark, sometimes just the right (or wrong) type of shaking will do the trick.  Now, in the process of forming water a lot of heat is generated, which has the potential to be very damaging.  Also, pure oxygen tends to burn super easy so there's not a lot of pure oxygen around.  And pure hydrogen tends to react with stuff a lot too.  So you don't bump into pure forms of them very often in nature.  And making pure forms of them is relatively difficult and expensive.  **DUE TO REQUESTS - VIDEOS**  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38ULHoKWZag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38ULHoKWZag) \\- an animation of what is going on  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8gE4oZ9FQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8gE4oZ9FQ) \\- a guy using 2 thumbtacks and a 9 volt battery to do this - but he isn't catching the gas  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV8KbQyF228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV8KbQyF228) \\- a guy mixing O and H in front of a flame, it goes POP and they zoom in on the small droplets of water formed on the inside.

    "answer": "Normally, telescopes work like big fancy digital cameras, light gets focus with lenses/mirrors onto a grid of really tiny buckets that count the amount of light particles that fall into it  For spectroscopy (finding these emission lines), the light is instead focused into a glass prism which splits the light apart based on its color, like that old Pink Floyd logo, which then gets spread onto a long line of those buckets, since amount the light breaks depends on its color, each bucket will now only catch light from a unique color  Turns out, the sun emits almost every color we know, except for a very few select colors, these specific colors are the ones absorbed by the stuff at the very outer layer of the sun and where the lines are on the spectrum tells us what element does the absorption and therefore what the surface of the sun is made of  Edit: the corona is extremely diffuse and basically transparent, the photosphere is actually what you see when you look at the sun, you can only see the corona during total solar eclipses, all the light wee see from the sun comes from this photosphere",

    "answer": "Electric airplanes have long been a great idea and people have tried to make work, but unfortunately, outside of experimental craft, its just not viable yet.  Airplane engines, both prop and jet engines, need a ton of power and a lot of fuel. Electric batteries simply aren't powerful enough compared to fuel at the same weight. You'd have so many batteries that they would weigh too much, fuel on other hand, provide a lot more energy for the weight. An electric plane wouldn't get too far, it would be too heavy. Fuel is a  great compromise as its quite powerful for the weight.  If we ever get batteries down an absolute ton in weight, we might see ideas for some smaller planes to operate on electric power. But the big planes would need even more reductions in battery weight or wild increases in battery efficiency and storage",

You can duplicate this effect in an evironment with an enclosed atmosphere, like a bus or a train or a car.  A motorcycle, however, does not have an enclosed atmosphere and cannot be ridden in a vacuum (internal combustion engines need oxygen).

    "question": "Eli5: Edible plants and fungi. I assume we used to determine if a food was edible by trial and error for most of the past. How would we determine newly discovered food edible today without jeopardizing health or life?",
    "answer": "The same process still applies, many survivalists have it memorized and use it in the field. It's called the Universal Edibility Test. It's a several step process that takes most of the day to accomplish.  First, you seperate out the various parts. You need to test roots, leaves, stems, buds, and flowers independently, because sometimes one part will be poisonous while another isn't.   You give each bit a good smell. Strong and unpleasant odors are usually a bad sign, and if you're in the field you'll just generally discard them without further testing.   You test for contact poisoning by placing a tiny piece on your wrist for just a moment. If it burns, itches, numbs, or breaks into a rash, you just discard it.  Then you boil each bit individually. Test each piece by briefly touching it to your lips, and then waiting 15-30 minutes to see if anything happens. After that, you can take a small piece into your mouth, chew a couple of times, and hold it in your mouth for 15-30 minutes to see if anything happens. If it's bitter or soapy, you just discard it.  If there's no reaction at all, swallow it and wait the rest of the day. If there's no ill effect after several hours, you can assume this part of the plant is edible. Repeat the process for each individual part of the plant. Many plants have both edible and inedible parts to them, so this can take several days.     As far as fungi goes... just don't. If you're in the field and you can't determine the exact species of mushroom you're looking at with 100% accuracy, don't touch it, don't eat it, just leave it alone. There are many kinds of mushrooms that are edible in one circumstance, but poisonous in another. Hen mushrooms are safe, but if they're growing on a conifer or cedar tree, they're poisonous.  There are scientific tests you can do on mushrooms to determine their exact chemical components and identify if any of them are poisonous, or if they combine to create something poisonous, but if you're out in the woods it's a better idea to just leave them alone.",

    "answer": "Anthropologists believe they were basically the same as modern humans, provided they were *Homo sapiens sapiens*. They buried their dead, they made art. They enjoyed sex. They had fun with their kids. They were as smart as people today.   There may have been slight facial differences with modern humans but there are a wide range of face shapes with modern humans and they would fit into that range. So like you might see one and while you might not be able to identify them as looking like people of a given ethnicity, you wouldn\u2019t think that no human would look that way. Early modern humans in Europe were dark skinned but blue eyes came along earlier than skin color became the very pale color that exists now, so you might see a blue eyed person with darker skin, an unusual combination today.   One change in the past 10,000 years is teeth. Ancient humans had an edge-to-edge bite. Front teeth, top and bottom, met at the edge. Nowadays almost everyone has the front upper teeth be in front of the lower front teeth, overlapping a bit. But ancient modern humans would use front teeth to bite down on meat and tear pieces off, pulling the incisors into alignment. They also had perfect teeth for the most part, with more muscular jaws, and that would affect their appearance. They wouldn\u2019t have most of the diseases of modern life such as nearsightedness, tooth decay, acne, etc. they lived in small groups so many of the diseases of high density living didn\u2019t exist or seldom happened, like measles, smallpox, sexually transmitted infections, maybe colds and flu.   Archaic Homo sapiens, meaning people pretty far back on that timeline you give, like 100,000-200,000 years ago, might have had more differences in appearance\u2014they\u2019d be more robust, bigger muscles, thicker brow ridges, less prominent chin.   Women\u2019s bodies would be quite different in the sense that they might only ovulate and have periods fairly seldom because they\u2019d be pregnant a lot and under the conditions they lived in, they would nurse for several years and not be fertile or have a period for most of that time.",

But more importantly, muscles cannot just convert any sort of energy into movement, just like a diesel engine can only use diesel and not steam or wind or electricity. The energy source for muscles is a specific chemical \"fuel\" in your body called ATP, muscles can only use that and nothing else.  However, while the ATP is the energy source, your brain has to control the muscles somehow, and it does that - simplifying here - by sending electric impulses along your nerves. If you touch an electric cable, the electricity will cause havoc with this communications system - your muscles believe that they're given random, frantic orders, and act accordingly.

If you drop a vase and it shatters then if you would measure the exact quantum state of the shards you should (in principle) be able to reconstruct what the vase looked like. You can scramble information to make it hard to read, but it's impossible to get rid of completely  But black holes appear to destroy information. From the outside it's fully defined by it's mass (and electrical charge, and rotation). So if you drop in a book or a stone of the same weight the state of the black hole just increases by that mass and it's impossible to find out what dropped in.

    "question": "ELI5 Why do we get dehydrated while flying?",
    "answer": "It's dry air sucked in from the outside, which is very cold, and very dry (-40 <1% humidity), and when you heat cold dry air, you get warm even dryer air. Depending on the age of the aircraft it is either engine bleed air, or outside air pulled in and compressed, or a mix of the two. Both are very dry. The humidity from people breathing helps moisten the air up and it's more comfortable if the air is recirculated in the cabin as it keeps the air a little more humid.   It's also much lower pressure (Usually equivalent of 6000 to 7000 feet) at cruising altitude inside of the aircraft. Lower pressure reduces the boiling point of water and increases the rate it evaporates. The lower the air pressure, the lower the vapor pressure and the more easily water boils and evaporates. This is why food often has high altitude instructions that require you to cook it longer because the food doesn't get as hot because the boiling point is lower. Water can never get hotter than the boiling point so lower boiling point, lower temp, longer cook.   Really though most of what happens is not dehydration, it's just drying of the mouth, sinuses, and throat, which prompts the body to feel thirsty.",

    "answer": "The air within the plane is dry and warm. It is intentionally kept that way to minimize the effects of corrosion on the metal parts within the plane.  Some of the newer planes are using more carbon fiber in their construction which means that the ambient humidity in the plane can be raised without risking damage to the plane itself.

To combat the effects of dehydration, the staff aboard the plane encourage frequent consumption of non-dehydrating liquids.",

    "answer": "\"Percussive maintenance\".      The Atari 520 ST was famous for having socketed chips that would work their way up and out of the socket due to cycles of expansion caused by heating and cooling, eventually causing the machine to \"fail\".      A solution - not a great one - but a solution that often worked, was to hold the entire machine about 11-18\" above the desk surface and drop it. The compression of the keyboard slamming down on the chips beneath them would push them back into the socket, temporarily \"fixing\" the problem. It was called the \"Atari ST drop test\".      Likewise, early Mac Classics had a logic board at a 90 degree angle to the mainboard that had soldered connections between the two PCBs. Cooling and heating cycles would cause tiny hairline fractures to form in the \"cold solder joints\" until eventually the system would fail until you reflowed those cold solder joints.      At Intel in the early 2000's, I had a production downtime even in the data center. We had to give status updates to a distro list as we progressed with the troubleshooting and resolution. At one point, at about 3:45 AM, after having worked on the machine since about 8 the previous evening, I sent out an update - lost in pages and pages of updates, that said, \"beat server, kicked server, cursed at server, curled into fetal position and cried myself to sleep.

    "question": "ELI5: Why is it impossible to suck through a straw that's 10.4 meters long?",
    "answer": "The action of sucking does not actually pull on water. Rather, it allows the air on the other end to push by removing the air from the end inside of your mouth.  This means that, since there is only 1 atm of air, you're limited to that much pushing.  As water climbs the tube, gravity pulls it down, generating a pressure to counteract the pushing. This pressure depends solely on the density of water and the height at the top of the water.  So, solving for the density of water, we see that water can only get 10.4 meters above its surface from the action of atmospheric pressure. If the straw goes deeper than the water's surface, then the straw itself can be longer, but the water can only be raised above its surface by that amount.  The formula for hydrostatic pressure is quite straightforward. p = \u03c1 g h  This is the pressure generated by gravity acting on the water, and it is the pressure that counteracts the pressure of air pushing up. Interestingly, the pressure of the air itself can be found using the same formula (although to get an accurate answer you have to modify it with calculus to account for gravity and changes in density).",
    "follow-up": "but what if the straw was thinner, that way as the water goes up, there is less pressure pulling it downwards therefore allows for it to go higher. and would in theory having one end of the straw be at the bottom of the mariana trench, allow the water to be sucked further past the ocean surface as there is more pressure pushing the water up due to the immense amount of water in the ocean?",

    "answer": "No, it isn't. The known laws of physics are incompatible with the idea of an object that has 'reversed entropy', in other words a 'reversed flow of time'. That would require laws that, for some reason, sometimes evolve backwards with respect to everything else, but only in certain parts of the universe.  This sort of sharp discontinuity, apart from itself being completely arbitrary, would basically completely mess up the calculations and result in all sorts of paradoxes. Like internal feedback loops that violate *determinism*, i.e. the ability of your law to predict anything.  So tl;dr, no, you couldn't make a version of the current laws that allow for objects with 'reversed flow of time'.",
    "follow-up": ">That would require laws that, for some reason, sometimes evolve backwards with respect to everything else, but only in certain parts of the universe.  Given that antimatter displays full CPT anti-symmetry to ordinary matter, how logical is the idea that \"anti matter is matter that moves backwards in time\"? As in, if we observed a recording of a regular particle played in reverse it would look like a (non played in reverse) anti-particle to us.  I've seen a PopSci episode saying there's kind of two concepts of telling time we know - one is matter vs. antimatter (and its CPT symmetry), and the other is \"entropy time\" stemming from the fact we're started with a highly ordered Universe so have a lot of \"entropy budget\" to spend making it less ordered. But we don't know if these are two separate arrows of time or if they're related in some way we don't yet know.  How accurate is this statement?",

    "answer": "New Orleans floods frequently because some of the city is extremely low elevation, so a 10ft storm surge will flood a massive area.   Other cities like NYC will flood because concrete doesn\u2019t absorb water like the ground does. When a field gets 3\u201d/8cm of rain in an hour, it will soak a lot of water in, form puddles out of a lot of it, and drain a small amount. The ditches at the sides of the road are to drain water off the road, the fields are expected to absorb all their water. When a city gets that rain, most of it isn\u2019t absorbed by tiny patches of soil, and the city is designed to not make puddles. As a result, thousands of gallons of water need to drain. And when the rainfall exceeds what the city\u2019s designed for, even by a little bit, the results are dramatic.",

The investors likely have cause to sue the company and/or its leadership for the fraud, but the civil case (of the investors) and the administrative case (of the SEC) are different ways of punishing the company. Sometimes part of the settlement of the administrative case with the SEC is restitution for people who were impacted.  For a personal analogy, imagine you scammed someone out of a large amount of money. You could be the target of both a criminal case put together by the police/DA (akin to the SEC case) and a civil case from your victim to recover their money. You can't put a company in jail, so they fine them. The investors/your victim don't *have* to come after you, but its on them to do so if they want to.",

    "question": "ELI5: What is human flatulence?",
    "answer": "Not a gastroenterologist, but let's examine the premise and start with some facts in the hopes of getting some serious answers. I think the point of your question lies in fart-transmission being different from fecal transmission. We know well that we can get sick from bacteria/viruses going from poop to another persons mouth and infecting them that way. You're suggesting an airborne transmission of an intestinal illness (I think).  1. The average amount of gas a human produces in a day is roughly 1L (per Google) 2. The average amount of air exhaled in a day is roughly 11,000L.  So from this we know that if a microorganism had to choose spreading via farting which is to say by airborne transmission, that's 11,000 times *less efficient* than just going straight through the lungs. We also know that microorganisms generally infect/attack the place they are released from, so an intestinal infection prefers to attack the intestine which means it needs to be eaten, not inhaled. *It is possible* to get intestinal infections in your lungs and lung infections in your intestines in certain cases but this isn't common, it's not the preferred method of transmission.  We can also assume that most farts are filtered through underwear and pants, which is similar to wearing a face mask, it'll filter out many of the particulates that microorganisms ride on. So let's assume transmission from fart, through clothes, into the lungs is yet further unlikely.  In the end, this doesn't pass the sniff test (...ha), it's just too circuitous to be an intentional transmission route. Much easier for the illness to spread via direct fecal contamination, in fact that's really, really easy.  However, a quick google search gives an affirmative \"Not Completely Impossible\" as there are demonstrated cases of Cholera (an intestinal illness) infecting the lungs of people with immune disorders. In this case, it's most likely a case of dirty-surface fecal contamination being introduced to the lungs via touching the nose/mouth and *inhaling the feces* but still, it's credible.  So \"Not Fully Impossible\" but extremely unlikely unless you have extremely poor hygiene habits and are immunocompromised.",
    "follow-up": "> In the end, this doesn't pass the sniff test (...ha), it's just too circuitous to be an intentional transmission route. Much easier for the illness to spread via direct fecal contamination, in fact that's really, really easy.  Thanks for taking the question seriously!  I guess what I've quoted above is one of the things I was curious about. The distinction between flatulence and feces. Can we draw a pretty stable line in the sand between the two, in most cases? Outside of some sort of serious sickness, where flatulence possibly leads to feces (sorry for gross visual), the two are basically in separate bacterial categories as far as I understand (please correct me if I'm wrong).  I know from reading random Reddit threads that many, many people like to sleep in their beds without any clothes. I've always found that idea sort of baffling for hygienic reasons, but then I started to wonder if my confusion/repulsion had any basis in fact. This is sort of the idiosyncratic origin story behind this thread's random question, I guess.  So I started to wonder...if those people are passing gas in bed while sleeping in the nude, are they rolling around in harmful bacteria? If they share their bed with someone else, or if someone else sleeps in that bed later on, would they also be rolling around in harmful bacteria? Would there be a risk of infection?

    "answer": "Inflation means too much money is moving too quickly, chasing after a limited quantity of goods so the price of goods rises.  Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage payments for home owners and higher cost of borrowing for people who want to borrow money to build things like homes.  Banks are allowed to lend out something like 20x the amount of cash they actually have, so when people borrow at low interest rates money is basically being created out of nothing and put into the economy chasing after the finite amount of real goods available.

When that memory becomes more limited, your computer operates more slowly, as it struggles to try to \"find a place to fit more stuff.\"  However, once you restart your computer, most of that memory is wiped clean and you start fresh, so your computer is often faster.

    "question": "ELI5: Can singularities be ever formed from an outsiders perspective?",
    "answer": "A quick note on terminology; the \"singularity\" is the theoretical point right in the centre of a massive object where its density and gravitational field are infinite under current best models. They may exist, or the models may be not quite right (e.g. quantum mechanics may get in the way). Black holes may have singularities at their centre. But black holes don't \"need\" singularities, they are defined by their event horizons.  The \"event horizon\" is the region around a black hole (technically a 2d surface) that makes a black hole special; it is the point where all worldlines (so future paths in spacetime - where things *could* go) of objects in that region end up falling down towards the massive object in the middle (see [this neat set of diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BH-no-escape-1.svg)). In the simple model for a black hole, the event horizon is a distance of 2GM/c^2 from the singularity (where G is the gravitational constant, M the total mass inside the event horizon and c the 'speed of light').  A black hole forms when there is enough mass within a small enough volume so that this distance (2GM/c^(2)) is outside the object. All that mass doesn't have to be concentrated at the singularity, it just has to be within the event horizon distance of it.  At the event horizon, from the perspective of an observer an infinite distance away, time dilation would be infinite. So when observing something fall into a black hole, you can never see the object cross the event horizon, it will just slow down and stop (and you can obviously never see it cross, as the light of it crossing can never reach you).  But locally everything looks normal. From the perspective of an object falling into the black hole, it doesn't notice the event horizon (although they'll be a lot of other stuff going on there - it won't be a friendly place to hang out), it just keeps falling. [This graphic shows this fairly well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gravitational_time_dilation_around_a_black_hole.gif) - on the left you have what things look like from the object's perspective as it falls in. On the right you have the outside observer's view. From the object's point of view, it just falls in as normal.  Of course, *this only applies once the black hole has formed*, so once the event horizon exists. Before then, the time dilation in that region, while significant, wouldn't be infinite. So there would still be time for things to fall in.  Disclaimer; I haven't done the maths (GR maths is notoriously difficult), but I suspect that yes, if you were an infinite distance away, it would take an infinite amount of time for a black hole to form. But if you are an infinite distance away none of that matters - you are too far away. If you are any closer (i.e. a finite distance away), it would take less than an infinite amount of time to form - and so it is possible.  And we know this is possible; black holes exist.",
    "follow-up": "First of all, thank you for your elaborate answer.  I do, or I think I do, know the difference between a  singularity, an event horizon and a black hole. That's why my question asked specifically about *singularities*. I'm not asking if \"black holes exist\" nor if event horizons could form. I do not doubt that at all.  All I'm asking about are singularities. Could they form?  &#x200B;  >Of course, *this only applies once the black hole has formed*, so once the event horizon exists. Before then, the time dilation in that region, while significant, wouldn't be infinite. So there would still be time for things to fall in.  So, you are saying, that when the star collapses the mass WILL, in a certainty, produce a singularity?   Let me show you my reasoning and correct me when I'm wrong (I assume I will be at some point): From a far away observer the black hole forms. Over a very long period it evaporates. In the end, it evaporates down to nothing. [According to this link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/05/20/ask-ethan-what-happens-when-a-black-holes-singularity-evaporates), the black hole cease to exist, the potential singularity is no more**.**    Now, from a perspective of a massive star: I begin to collapse. All the mass gravitates towards my center. Meanwhile, due to gravitational time dilation from GR, my time ticks slower relative to the rest of the universe. My size crosses the Schwarzschild radius, an Event Horizon is now present. However, now I start to loose mass due to Hawking Radiation. From an outsiders point of view, this is very slow, but from my point of view this is getting faster and faster. **Could the singularity form before Black Hole's mass is evaporated?**",

    "question": "Eli5 How do rich people pay little to no taxes on their income?",
    "answer": "in simple terms, the trick is to have as little income as possible compared to your wealth. You only pay taxes on money you have to spend but barely on money you only own.  So you need to make sure that your income is very close to the money you spend in a given year.  The second trick is to only transfer wealth to income where the tax rates are most convenient to do so. When you have vastly more wealth than you need, you can \"plan\" when you take out certain amounts of money.  (e.g. long term investments are generally taxed lower than short term. So if you can \"plan\" to keep your money invested for years, you pay less tax when you sell them compared to buying and selling in the same year)  The third trick is to use shell companies to circumvent individual ownership. Wealth and income are taxed differently for companies than it is for individuals. aka jeff Bezos doesn't own a yacht. Jeff Bezos started a company, took out a loan at a bank (using his Amazon shares as collateral) and then the company buys the yacht. He then \"leases\" or \"rents\" the yacht from his own company.  This accomplishes a few things:  * He doesn't have to pay income taxes on the money used to buy the yacht. * He doesn't directly own the yacht, therefore it's not counted towards his net wealth. (and thus cannot be taxed) * The company has a whole bunch of tax write offs because it barely turns a profit.    * (in simple terms, the trick is to lease the yacht for just more than it costs the company to own/operate it)  \\*EDIT\\*  lease note that this is grossly simplified. It's irrelevant to know all the loopholes yourself. The last trick is to have so much money that you can hire a bunch of family accountants that research and do this for you. You just say \"i want a yacht\" and they will figure out the best way to do it for you.  \\*EDIT 2\\*  The final trick is to hire the lawyers and accountants that created, or create, the rules.

Any colour in it is entirely false.  As for texture, that depends on what sort of texture you're talking about. A video-game style texture with different colours isn't possible since the colours are all too large. A physical bump map texture isn't possible since nothing ever touches subatomic particles (except other subatomic particles in nuclear reactors/detonations).

    "answer": "The same reason those other species have instincts. A coincidence of resources, circumstances, and/or sexual selection tendencies that shaped our evolution. i.e. Instincts helped some species survive.  Humans depend on their instincts less presumably because our other non-instinctive tendencies are more effective at causing successful reproduction and survival to reproductive age.  Neurologists argue that mutations in the human brain structure caused larger distances between the more primitive parts of our brain and memory storing areas. This distance that neural impulses need to travel still had to fit in a small skull which caused some cross-over signals to occur. Erroneous associations between things like recalling a memory of a tiger being dangerous and painful and that sharp rock you sat on to be similarly painful may constitute what we call \"creativity\" and enable ideas like using sharp rocks to defend from sharp tigers. This kind of association was not due to logical discourse but an accidental and irrational association of two mildly similar things due to neurons firing incorrectly. This erroneous processing that gave rise to creativity was selected for over and over due to its apparent value in creative problem solving.  So, it might be argued that creative problem solving has been a more effective means of survival, reproduction, and/or survival of young to reproductive age. That being the case, the human genome \"wastes no time\" maintaining instinctive behaviors.",

It doesn\u2019t benefit the drug company in any way for their medicines to last longer than two years because they want you to have to buy more.   That\u2019s it.

    "question": "ELI5 UK: how are mortgage rates so low?",
    "answer": "Major Central Banks (and the Exchequer) are pumping money into their economies through quantitative easing (QE). This is the Central Bank buying back government bonds from banks and therefore putting cash into the accounts of the banks. And this cash is not earning much when redeposited with the CB or when lent to other banks (near zero and sometimes negative rates).   Banks are therefore literally sitting on funds that they are not earning any money from if they cannot lend it to others. This explains their willingness to lend at very low rates. These loans (it is hoped) goes into productive investment and therefore helps push up economic activity through wage increases and consumption. Unfortunately, this cash also goes into asset purchases like property and the stock market which isn't exactly ideal (rising property prices and share prices leading to asset price \"bubbles\") Ultimately this kind of expansionary policy tends to lead to higher inflation which is what many people are fearing is happening now.   Until the Central Banks dial back this policy either by slowing down (tapering off) QE or by increasing interest rates, this might continue. The problem here is that while tapering and increasing interest dials down inflation pressure (the intended effect) it also risks a large fall in asset prices (housing and stock markets). The problem with rapidly falling asset prices is that this can lead to enormous pressure on banks to dial back quickly on loans (fearing loan defaults) and this becomes a multiplying effect on slowing down the economy (since a lot of economic activity relies on bank credit. This can lead to a condition called stagflation - where prices increase AND economic activity decreases, essentially the worst of both worlds.   Long story short, it is very possible that the Central Banks are willing to accept (hopefully temporary) higher inflation while trying to avoid massive and sudden asset price deflation. This is a very delicate path to take.",
    "follow-up": "Thanks for that clear explanation!  Can Central Banks adjust their deposit rates based on a bank\u2019s loan portfolio?  For instance, if bank A has a portfolio heavy with greenfield investment, then they receive a proportionately better deposit rate compared to bank B which has a loan portfolio with greater exposure to, say, investors who are just churning existing housing property.",

Since these grains are super tiny (far tinier than the pixels on a screen) we can get really high resolutions from them before they start to become blurry.  Also \"tiny memory card,\" vs \"tiny flat frame of film,\" is also not quite a fair comparison since:  * A digital film will be compressed. This means throwing away some of the data/detail in order to save on file size. An uncompressed 4k movie would be hundreds of GB (if not more). There's no such thing as \"compressing,\" film, so we get all the detail captured by the camera basically for free. * An entire IMAX film isn't just a single frame of film. It's a reel about the size of a table which is WAY larger than a memory card. * While a memory card might be made of billions of transistors, each *frame* on a strip is made of billions of grains. Similarly while each transistor can store either a 1 or a 0, we need many 1s and 0s just to represent a single pixel, while a single grain on film can \"store,\" an entire color completely on it's own.

Stars do, at the end of their life, produce heavier elements - but that production actually robs them of the energy needed to hold their massive gravity up. So when that happens, a star is at the point of imminent collapse.  The Sun, specifically, does not make iron because its core is not hot and dense enough. The Sun is currently only hot enough to produce helium from hydrogen. Late in its life, the Sun will partially collapse until its core heats up enough to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen, but the Sun is not large enough to go any further than that.  > Also wouldn't stars make better nuclear reactors than our own nuclear reactors and particle accelerators? So why can't they also make elements with really high atomic numbers, like Oganesson and Fermium?  During their final moments - and in particular during the collisions of neutron stars - they *do* produce very heavy elements (although I don't think it's known whether they produce all the way to 118 or beyond). During the [r-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process), stars run up the line of nuclei that can juuuuust barely take another neutron.

    "answer": "Capacitors have high impedance at low frequencies, and low impedance at high frequencies. Inductors are the opposite. Low impedance at low frequencies, and high impedance at high frequencies. And impedance basically means frequency dependent resistance. So, one thing you can do is use a capacitor to drive high frequencies into the ground, and inductor to do the same for low frequencies. Boom, that's a band-pass filter. That's pretty useful for radio applications, since you probably don't want to be listening all the frequencies at the same time.  Now for radios, a tuning capacitor is certainly used to control the internal mixing frequency, but that works just the same for incoming and outgoing signals. I'm not se sure if a variable inductor for transmitting was ever a thing.",

    "answer": "Permanent and rubber cement contain solvents such as toluene, acetone, or xylene which are volatile liquids at room temperature which means they can easily be absorbed by the lungs, pass through capillaries, and quickly enter the bloodstream.  Since they\u2019re small molecules, they can often pass the blood-brain barrier as well.

Long-term use of solvents can actually cause permanent damage to these nerves through build up of high-concentrations and destruction of myelin.   Other inhalants\u2014such as nitrous oxide\u2014work similarly by temporarily interfering with cell receptors, but long-term deplete essential cofactor vitamins such as B12, which is also necessary for nerve function.

    "follow-up": ">how do those electrical signals convert back to a sound  Magnets. Seriously, it's just magnets.  When your voice hits the microphone on your phone, it vibrates a magnet back and forth, and the vibrating magnet ripples the electrons in the phone line.  When the ripples (which travel almost at the speed of light) reach the person on the other end, they go into another magnet. When a magnet connected to wires is vibrated, it ripples the electrons \u2014 and when the rippling electrons touch the magnet on the other side, it vibrates the magnet! It's literally the inverse of how it went in. Yeah, that's right, a speaker is fundamentally *the same exact thing* as a microphone, just built differently to better suit the task.  So, when the magnet in the speaker on your friend's phone vibrates, it moves the air around it, because all moving objects contain momentum that transfers to the molecules around it. And these air movements are sound \u2014 your voice, to be exact.  >that mimics a persons pitch or tone of voice so precisely?  Now, to address this part. If you move the magnet back and forth very quickly at 256 Hz (256 back-and-forths per second) the person on the other end hears a pure C note. Just one note.  Your voice is a complex superposition of a shitton of different pure fundamental frequencies. In other words, your voice is multiple pure notes played at the same time. When you say \"hey dude,\" your vocal cords are producing many individual pure notes that add up to form a much more complex sound. *All* sounds can be broken up into constituent pure notes. This is the concept of the Fourier transform, but you don't need to worry about that.  How do all those notes fit into the phone line at the same time? Well, they just sorta... do. Electrons are *tiny.* Go look up the size of an electron \u2014 yeah, they're really freaking small. Tons of them can fit on a very small wire at the same time. So, each of the sound waves that add up to your voice are simply carried along the wire simultaneously. Imagine if cars were like ghosts, and they could just pass through each other while driving to their destination. That's what electrons are like. It isn't really this simple in reality because of quantum physics, and I'm not qualified to explain that, but for 99% of cases, it just works like that.  And all those constituent waves travel the exact same way as the single pure note dud. The only reason the clarity goes down at all is because some of the electrons bump into shit. As technology gets better, we find ways to keep the electrons from bumping into shit, and we improve the clarity of our phones.  I hope that answers your question, and I'm happy to keep explaining if it doesn't.",

Rather, one of the chromosomes that we all have a pair of gets an extra copy, so the embryo has three instead of the regular two.   For most chromosomes, if you have three instead of two, it doesn't lead to viable embryo. The child will die either in the uterus, or at a young age. For some chromosomes, the \"damage\" is less severe, and the child will survive, but may have health problems, including often a reduced life expectancy. Down syndrome, for instance, is caused by a *trisomy* (three chromosome copies) of the 21st chromosome (we all have 23 chromosome pairs that scientists have labeled with numbers 1-23).  Down syndrome is always caused by trisomy of the 21st chromosome, but there are other trisomies that are compatible with life and lead to different symptoms, such as trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). The latter is more severe and often results in miscarriage too, but some fetuses do survive.   For sex chromosomes, i.e. X and Y, typical females have a pair, XX, while typical males have two different copies, XY. You can have trisomy of these sex chromosomes too, leading to combinations like XXX, XXY or XYY.

If gravity is a product of that relationship, does that even imply that gravity isn\u2019t a force?

    "answer": "Using ordinary paintings as an example. Once a painting becomes famous, the painting will naturally be mass forged. One safeguard available is for the artist to provide an authenticity certificate along with his sold painting to prove that it's the \"one true\" painting. There are many copies, but only \"one true\" painting.  For NFTs involving digital art, they're trying to replicate that concept using a central server as \"proof of authenticity\". The NFT owner gets full rights to the digital artwork and is considered the copyright owner of that one artwork itself.  But in practice, just like even though there is \"one true\" Mona Lisa, we can see copies of the Mona Lisa everywhere with a simple google and pinterest search. So, you don't really need to \"own\" the Mona Lisa to see the Mona Lisa.  The question would be \"Since digital art can be copy-pasted easily and good digital art will be mass posted for free on social media the moment it's out, why NFTs and proofs of ownership?\" Vanity and speculators.

The mushrooms produce spores in the gills (for the gilled ones of course) which fall from them in the hundreds of thousands per mushroom (it starts as soon as the mushroom cap opens), then are taken away by the wind and the whole cycle continues.

    "answer": "Intense heat or intense cold can shock mold spores to sprout mycelium. After Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the cities turned pink with aspergillus from the spores that were heat shocked by the firestorm and blast (and yes, some spores did survive the atomic blast). Taking room temp food covered with spores (think strawberries) and putting them in the fridge cold shocks the spores in to action too. The spores are everywhere ALL THE TIME.  And they don't like water. Aspergillus spores are football shaped and when water spalshes on them, they get spread all over by flying through the air end over end. I did genetic work on fungi in college and I watched this happen under the microscope (a dissecting stereoscope actually). It's very cool. In order to control where we put the spores, we used buffer solutions with a teeny amount of surfactant in them, a surfactant is soap.  The soap makes the spores stay suspended in the water. I use this secret to wash fruits that are prone to fungal infections like strawberries and blueberries. I fill my sink with lots of cold water (\\~ 2-4 gal) and then add 3 drops of Dawn dishwashing liquid. Then I pour in the berries and swirl them around removing the overtly infected ones. Then I just pull the drain and get rid of the water and wash the spores down the drain. Then I spread the berries on a towel to dry. It makes my berries last a lot longer.

The big problem is that it has an almost digital effect - it is either working really well and then it doesn't work at all once the \"seal\" is broken. This was the old days when the seal was actually a flap along the side of the car.  The safety issue is that cars could go into corners REALLY fast with ground effect but if any unsettling occurs, say a slight bump on the road, the cars would immediately lose the ground effect and essentially take off (ie start to fly). There are several examples of that in F1 where the cars would start flying off the road and into competitors completely out of control.  Essentially, it was too unpredictable.",

Space is only about 100 km away, but lifting things this far takes a huge amount of energy.  The equation for how much energy is simple, just mass (in grams) times the gravitational acceleration (10 m/s^(2)) times height in meters.  So if you want to lift a ton of garbage to space, you're looking at 1,000,000 g x 10 m/s^(2) x 100,000 meters = 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion) Joules of energy.  If we translate that into food, that becomes 239,000,000 kilocalories (same as dietary calories)  Basically this is the amount of energy used by about 120,000 humans in a day.  Or, put another way, 1 trillion joules is the amount of energy stored in 70 million aa batteries.

Because the oxygen has two lone pairs on it these lone pairs can attack organic molecules in the organism/virus disrupting metabolic processes or outright destroying cell components.

    "answer": "Cell membranes are made from molecules called lipids. These are basically fat molecules that are ordered in a specific way. When these come into contact with alcohol, the alcohol is able to, basically, dissolve the membrane because of how the alcohol and lipids interact. This causes the contents of the cell to leak into the environment, killing the cell. On top of that, the alcohol can also cause proteins to warp in ways that either render them useless or even harmful to the cell.  When it comes to disinfectants, you will likely often see 70% alcohol being used. This is actually for a number of reasons. On an economic level, it's simply cheaper and easier to make. On a disinfectant level, it is good enough, and can even be more effective at dealing with spores because: Having a significant water content increases evaporation time.

But if you can only have it once a year it'll taste really really good.  But no, waiting a year will not make you have some insane orgasm, jerk of whenever you want to as long as it isn't becoming unhealthy.  It's not just muscles involved. The brain is wired to make it feel good to motivate reproduction. Your central nervous system is responsible for the orgasmic feeling I believe and moreover your brain releases pleasure hormones as well.   Having a partner involved will also make it feel better because intimate touch in general makes the brain send out even more pleasure hormones.  Also I must say that this is literally the first time I've ever heard anyone talk about \"training your muscles related to orgasm to get better orgasms\"",

Most people do not understand what nutrition is and if you sit around watching cable television then you will be brainwashed by commercials that revolve around terrible foods. All of these foods that are bad for you should not be sold the way that they are and societies should put into place protections that stop people from exploiting other people for profit in these manners.

    "answer": "Because people who are bad with money will make even more money for the dealership and the lending company. They can tack on a bunch of extra fees, jack up the interest rate etc. If someone pays their loan off as quickly as possible that's not actually ideal for the company, the lose that source of income. But you get the guy with bad credit at a 20% interest rate, well now he's paying so much more. When I used to work in subprime lending it wouldn't be unusual to see people pay nearly twice the cost of the loan in interest. Poor people make companies a lot of money.

    "answer": "I think it is misleading you to call them red, green, and blue color receptors. In reality each of these receptors responds partially to all light waves in the visible range. You can see how each of them respond on a [graph like this one](https://blog.captive-aquatics.com/.a/6a010535f11c3d970c0133f5b4a954970b-800wi). We call them red, green, and blue because of where the strongest response is, but if someone has only green cones for some reason their eyes still respond perfectly well to pure red light - it'll just look like slightly less vivid light of whatever their perception is of the only color they can see.  When we see a particular color, our brain is doing a relatively complex computation - it looks at how much each cone is activated, and compares this to situational things like what color the illuminating light appears to be in a scene. To do this it necessarily has to already have assumptions about what colors make sense, to use as a reference. It's very easy to trick this computation by putting your eyes in an unusual context, like [rapidly changing background colors](https://us-browse.startpage.com/av/anon-image?piurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net%2FwNcRvG84RnMWkTAPM5twrR-1200-80.jpg&sp=1644301314T9b2a873cc17a67c83029d81aaf61d55dc4f04cc679256a6144fe75fa002fccaa).",

Sadly most of these cells have a very short lifespan (around 2 days) and when their \"corpses\" accumulate they create pus. Inflammation appears whenever our white blood cells discover something \"not right\": it is like ringing a local alarm, while pus appears when lots of white cells, called by the alarm, gather for a long time and then die in the area. So, while these mechanisms do appear durning infections, it doesnt mean that when they do there is an actual infection. Simply this time the foreign object instead of being a bacteria is a looong string of chitin (the hair). The white cells continue to attack it trying to remove it and in the end just die around it.

Waiting around for humans to spontaneously mutate the ability to biologically produce chlorophyll is extremely unlikely.  Now the other problem is that there is really no good reason to want to do this in the first place.

This could mean that people, organisations and countries would be cautious of lending the US money as the US has shown that it doesn't pay it back.  However, higher interest rates would mean that the US would have to pay more money back and that might entice some to lend.    Having debt in itself isn't bad for a country.

    "answer": "That's what electrical engineers are for.  Voltage pushes the electrons through the wire. If you run a direct wire between the live and ground prongs of your outlet, there is little to impede their flow and you get a flood of electrons - breakers in your house shut off power when this happens.  Devices limit their current draw in different ways. Basic resistive components have a resistance - they are highly imperfect conductors and so electrons encounter a lot of resistance as they try to move. This hinders the flow. One of the most basic equations you'll find in electronics is V=IR, which describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.  Other devices may use inductive or capacitive limits - AC power is constantly trying to change, and these components can limit it by either requiring or resisting change - unlike a resistor these do not turn energy into heat and so are more efficient.  More modern supplies switch on and off. By switching on and off faster or slower, we can limit how much power flows through without bulky capacitors or inductors and without the waste of resistors. Semiconductor technology has made this solution very cheap.  There are many more methods, but that's the basics.",

    "answer": "The top answer [here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/146897/if-angular-velocity-angular-acceleration-are-vectors-why-not-angular-displace) is pretty solid. The tl;dr is not to worry about it if you're not a mathematician.  Basically angular displacement is a rotation. And rotations don't commute. Which means they can't be vectors because mathematicians have said that one of the rules for vectors is that they have to commute under addition. So you can't use vectors, you have to use matrices.  Could we define vectors in a different way? Sure. But mathematicians have gone with that.  There are a few things like this where things that we treat as vectors or think of as vectors (outside mathematics) don't fit the strict definitions of vectors, but provided we don't tell the mathematicians it is all fine. Angular velocity and magnetic fields, for example, don't strictly meet the mathematical definition of a vector, but they are close enough that no one else cares - in these examples the things don't transform the 'right' way under reflections or similar transformations. Rotations are even worse at pretending to be a vector than these things, so the difference is a bigger deal.  The infinitesimal angular displacement is \"allowed\" to be a vector(ish) because it does commute up to second order terms. So if it is small enough the difference isn't noticeable.",
    "follow-up": "The link is very helpful. In particular, I believe the second answer too, which proceeds to explain that the infinitesimal angular displacement has a direction, which is the axis which it is turned. Does that mean that its direction is supposed to be the axis perpendicular to the plane where our point rotates? If so, it would also make sense that the angular velocity also has the same direction, even if as you were saying, we see them as vectors even if they don't strictly follow the definition of a vector",

Also, Technically speaking The earth is not a perfect sphere. It's an oblate spheroid, or a kind of squashed sphere.

    "answer": "The definition of a game engine is essentially: what you have left over if you take the game out of the game. It's all the behind-the-scenes stuff that makes everything work. You look at the screen and see a picture of a dragon - that's the game. Somebody had to draw a dragon and put that in the game. What about the code that turns the drawing into 3D pixels? That's the engine.   So the engine is actually the majority of the code in the \"game\". It's not surprising it affects almost everything.   Yes, every engine has its upper limits. Something like the original Doom, for example, was designed to run on a DOS computer in 1994 or whatever, and it takes a lot of shortcuts for speed, and has a lot of limitations to make those shortcuts work. You can't look up or down in the original Doom. And the monsters aren't even 3D. Those are the limitations people accepted in exchange for getting it to work at all.  Sometimes there are fundamental design tradeoffs. For example, Factorio has a multiplayer mode. There's a lot of stuff happening in a Factorio game and it would be laggy if the server had to keep telling every player what was happening around them. So what it actually does is each player's computer runs the entire game and they stay synced up. But this means you can't have anything in the game that's random, because they'd get out of sync. Even things that seem random aren't actually random. It also means every player's computer needs to download a copy of the entire game world, when they log in. And it means if anyone's computer is too slow to run the game at normal speed, everyone gets slowed down, or that person gets kicked out.  So you can either have multiplayer that isn't laggy, **or** people with slow computers can play multiplayer, but not both. And changing from one to the other means rewriting the whole multiplayer part of the game from scratch. If you show someone a game that's designed to avoid the lag and ask how slow computers can play multiplayer without slowing everything down, the answer is they can't. It's not that it's impossible; it's just impossible *in that engine design with the fast multiplayer*. If you changed it it wouldn't be the same multiplayer engine any more. Hope this helps.",

It's extremely important to point out. \"Correlation doesn't imply causation\" is part tired meme, part misused rhetorical trick.  *Let's say: We measure the prevalence of depression in a population. Some part of the population start working night shifts. We measure again over time. It turns out that the prevalence of depression among those starting on night shifts has increased compared to before, an effect not seen in the others.*  Does this PROVE that working night shifts cause depression? Not at all. Could be that the main employers of night shift workers have to cut costs and are treating people badly for it. Could be that those starting night shifts were forced into it by depressing circumstances. Mental health cause and effect is hard to PROVE on a cellular cause-and-effect level.  But the correlation absolutely IMPLIES it. It tilts the balance of probability. It may well become \"more likely than not\" in the absence of counterevidence. \"More likely than not\" is usually a sufficient basis for policy decisions, personal choices, winning civil lawsuits.   Correlation is absolutely a standalone basis and argument, and in a discussion it creates a presumption of causation and shifts the responsibility to the others to present alternative explanations.",

    "answer": "In the language of vectors and matrices; A geometric vector is basically something with a length and direction. You can transform vectors by multiplying matrices by them, for example a rotation of 180 degrees in 2D can be represented by the matrix  |\\-1|0| |:-|:-| |0|\\-1|  If you multiply any vector by this matrix then it will rotate it around 180 degrees.  Now most matrices aren't that simple and they will do a combination of operations, changing the length and direction of vectors in complex ways.For a given matrix an eigenvector is one which doesn't have its direction changed, i.e only its length is scaled when you multiply it by that matrix. The eigenvalue is how much that length is scaled.  For example if we have some matrix M and a vector (3,5). Then say we multiply M\\*V and get a new vector (6,10) which = 2\\*(3,5). This means V is an eigenvector of M with an eigenvalue of 2, applying M to V has just scaled it by a factor 2 without changing its direction.",

    "answer": "So we have a fairly good understanding of how stars work; we can discern quite a bit about them from their size and color and luminosity.  So now pass a planet in front of that light, and the light will change. Not only will it dim, because it's partially obscured, but the spectral lines will change. From how they change, we can deduce the chemistry of the object that passed in front of it. We can, for example, tell that the object is gaseous, or has an atmosphere, or is rocky, and some of its basic chemical makeup. We can deduce more from other clues, like the period of the orbit, so it's orbital distance, its gravity, other things.  A lot of the conclusions, like it rains diamonds, come from deduction.

    "answer": "It is not unusual for vaccines to require multiple stabs for full efficiency. After the first injection you get a strong response from the immune system that will be able to get rid of the vaccine. But you only get a partial respons from the memory cells that is responsible for helping the immune system recognizing future infections. So another injection as the first immune response have died down can help increase the number of memory cells. As for why there is exactly 3 weeks between the stabs for the BioNTech vaccine is because that was what they used in their stage 3 trial so that is what have been certified. Most of the vaccines we administer have had a lot of testing to figure out how they are most efficient while they wait for the paperwork to complete. But for vaccines like the coronavirus vaccines as well as the seasonal flu we do not have time for this so we just make educated guesses and run trials to make sure this is safe and effective.  There are lots of indications suggesting that the BioNTech vaccine works just fine with just one shot. The trial can be interpreted as low as 65% efficiency after three weeks but some suggest this might be as high as 98% after five weeks with just one stab. And some countries are delaying the second injection in order to make sure as many people as possible have the first injection as soon as possible.",

But time is a tricky thing, because it is and isn't. It is a thing that exists between things that exist. If you have an empty cube with absolutely nothing in it, no particles no interacting forces, there is no time in it. Time exists between two things that interact.   For an observer to say that something has happened, it can only measure it from it's perspective so time comes in to existence from our perspective. If it can't interact with us or we can't observe it, the time starts existing in practical sense. Yes it can exist between other things, but only thing that matters is the observer and the other thing. Even if there isn't a direct link to observe or for interaction, there can be indirect thing, in which case time comes in to existence through the chain that leads all to way to the even itself.   I don't know if it makes it any easier, but stuff like this becomes way easier to understand when you accept the fact that time is not a thing, while also being a thing. Time is a thing between things, it can not exist by itself. You can not tell time from a still image, but you can tell time from two images, as in you can say that time has happened because things have changed.  But in short.

    "question": "Eli5: why is it so easy to make heat but so hard to make cold?",
    "answer": "The comments are mostly right, but I wanted to try to simplify it even more. The question is, what is heat? The easiest way to think about heat is if we're talking about a gas made up of a bunch of atoms. Temperature in this system is a measure of how much those atoms jiggle. If they're jiggling a lot, then they're very hot. If they're not jiggling much, then it's cold. If you touch a hot gas, the atoms in the gas hit your hand very quickly and cause the atoms in your hand to jiggle from all the impacts. If you light a match, the energy from the match causes the atoms to jiggle even more meaning it's heating up more. If you throw a ball in the gas, every atom it hits gains energy, and then hits a bunch of other atoms causing the entire gas to gain jiggling while slowing down the ball (air friction).  Now how do you remove the jiggling from the gas? There is a concept in physics called entropy. Smashing an egg on the ground is very easy to do. Putting the egg back together again takes a lot of time and effort. Similarly, getting a billion gas molecules to jiggle is easy. Getting them all to stop jiggling is very hard and takes effort.

    "answer": "The key to ISO 9001 is documented processes.  In your audit, you will get a list of processes that the company says describe what the \"shipping\" department does.  You will seek out examples of each process.  Then you will examine the records for all the instances of work that uses the process to see if any instances didn't follow the process (perhaps by following a different process).  Then you will audit the work that is left, to see if there is work going on for which there is no process (sometimes called orphan work).   All your observations will be written up in an audit report, which the assessors will use (with audit reports from all the company's other departments) to determine where the company meets the standards and where it does not.  The assessment team will explain how they want this done/documented.",
    "follow-up": "From (outdated) memory - pretty much this. And my understanding is that (perversely) it's not part of the audit to say how good or otherwise the process is - it's ultimately their business, not yours. Simply, can they demonstrate that they follow their processes?  It's one reason why, when the shoe's on the other foot, you should never be unnecessarily *over*-specific in laying out your processes. The more detailed they are, the more things that you can fail to do (or be unable to demonstrate).",

    "answer": "We can have just carbohydrates to burn for energy, and in a healthy body, carbohydrates are burned first. Brain and other nerve cells can only process glucose; if you don\u2019t ingest it; your liver has to break down muscle tissues to extract glycogen and supply glucose to the brain.   Fats are both used as energy store and as building blocks; most cell membranes are based on triglycerides and many metabolic processes require fats as solvents for other things.   Protein does not need to be burned for energy; proteins are used as energy source only if there are no others; among other things because cells can\u2019t process them as easily as carbohydrate, because there\u2019s some nasty nitrogen residue left overs etc. Normally proteins get broken down in amino acids and cellular mechanisms use these to repair and build cells, build enzymes, build transport molecules for key chemical reactions etc.",

    "answer": "They test samples  Almost all liquid fueled engines are test fired on a test stand before being integrated into the big rocket. This way you know that all the plumbing and pumps in the engine are good to go.  The tank needs to be pressure tested, generally this would be done on early samples to confirm what the simulations said. This would be an early design validation bit for the most part and not redone on every new tank once you've confirmed it works.  They also have the ability to abort right at the beginning if something is wrong.  The liquid fueled engines of the rocket generally start 1-3 seconds before launch and the rocket is held down by big clamps. If any of the engines don't seem quite right (not enough thrust, too much thrust, too hot, etc) then they'll cut the engines and abort the launch. There's no way to abort a solid rocket motor so once those boosters start up its going and there's nothing you can do.  On the upside, solid rocket motors are dumb simple so a reliable manufacturing process pretty well avoids issues for them which is why the military uses them so often as they can sit around for years and then just GO with minimal prep work",

    "question": "ELI5: If lightning takes the shortest path to the ground, why is it all jagged-like in the sky, and not a straight line?",
    "answer": "How a lightning bolt (or any electric arc) forms:  1. Two opposite charge distributions build up in the clouds and ground, creating a voltage between the two and therefor an electric field distributed in the space between them.  2. In some area, usually near a sharp point in one of the charge distributions, the electric field exceeds the breakdown strength of air, stripping electrons from the air molecules and causing that area to become conductive.  3. Charge from the charge distribution flows into this area until it is at the same voltage. That small patch of volume is now a conductive extension of the charge distribution.  4. There is now the same voltage between the two charge distributions, and at a slightly smaller distance, further concentrating the electric field between the two, which will lead to further breakdown of the air.  5. This process repeats continuously until a full conductive path of ionized air is created between the charge distributions. At which point the entirety of the charge will flow and the two opposite charge distributions will neutralize each other. As the charge is depleted, the electric field will weaken, and no new paths will be formed, first path to ground wins.  So why is the path jagged?  If you took two metal plates, one at 0v and one at 12v, there would be an electric field evenly distributed between them. Now if you took a third plate at 0v and put it between the other two, the electric field would be concentrated between the middle plate and the 12v plate, the presence of the middle plate has deprived the outer 0v plate of its surrounding electric field.  It works similarly in lightning, streamers lower to the ground will block the progress of streamers above, streamers to the sides of other streamers will tend to redirect them away. Each one at any instant will progress in the direction of the strongest electric field, and they will influence each other\u2019s electric fields to point away from each other.  The geometry of the charge distributions and the shape of the streamers at any instant during the process will ultimately determine the path of lightning.  The \u201cpath of least resistance\u201d explanation is not true and this isn\u2019t even rigorously well defined when you think about it. The charge distributions will build up along the surfaces facing each other, you could pick two points on these surfaces and find the path between them which has the smallest line integral of resistivity along it. But which two points? The answer will be different for different points. And the resistivity of the various sections of air is dynamically changing as the conductive path is being formed, so the path of least resistance is constantly changing too. Not to mention the resistivity of air should only be dependent on its temperature, pressure and humidity which will not vary so much for neighboring patches of air, so you wouldn\u2019t expect such a jagged path if it was truly resistance driving the process. It would be a straight line or have a slight but smooth curve to account for the changing pressure, temperature and humidity as a function of altitude.  So it\u2019s not the path of least resistance, it\u2019s a complex result of the instantaneous geometry of the charge distributions and current locations of the other streamers which will guide a streamer in one direction or the other. I don\u2019t think there is a simple way to characterize the path which lightning will ultimately take in any given situation.",

    "answer": "The taste that we associate with metal is actually your brain's generic error response to nonsensical taste information coming from your mouth.  Anything that causes the neurons in your taste buds to begin firing off randomly will produce a metal taste.  The reason that we associate the taste with metal is because the most common way to cause temporary dysfunction in your taste buds is by putting something made out of metal in your mouth.  Metal itself has no taste.  When you put a metal object in your mouth you're creating an environment that is very similar to a weak battery.  This creates a very slight electrical current within your mouth, triggering the neurons in your taste buds to malfunction.  Your brain doesn't doesn't know how to process that information and you end up tasting \"error\".    The reason that we associate the taste of \"error\" with that of metal is because sticking something metal in your mouth is a pretty common occurrence for most kids - so its pretty likely that the first time you taste \"error\" will be the result of putting metal in your mouth.  There isn't a whole lot other than metal that will produce an error taste, so because the only experience most people will have had with the taste is sticking a metal object in their mouth, they associate the taste with metal.  One of the few other things that will cause the taste buds in your mouth to malfunction is high levels of radiation.  That radiation both  directly damages the taste buds and has an interaction with your saliva that creates a slight electrical current in your mouth.  The end result is that your taste buds begin firing off randomly and generate the \"error\" taste that people typically associate with metal.",

    "question": "ELI5: How does light travel in space?",
    "answer": "Sound is what happens when the particles in a material push against each other in a wave. Honestly, it\u2019s very similar to just waves you would see in the ocean. Particles bunch up into a wave, and then spread out between the waves.   Light on the other hand, is what happens when the electromagnetic field oscillates.   To explain that a bit more, imagine a magnet. When you hold the magnet near a piece of iron, the iron will get pulled towards the magnet. The strength of the pull depends on how far away the magnet is though. If the magnet is basically touching the iron, it gets pulled really hard, but if the magnet is on the other side of the room, it hardly pulls the iron at all.   That \u201cpull\u201d is analogous to the magnetic field. When the iron is being pulled strongly, the magnetic field put out by the magnet is strong at the iron\u2019s location. When the iron is hardly being pulled, the magnetic field is pretty weak. As a disclaimer, this isn\u2019t a completely accurate way to picture the magnetic field, since it also has a direction, but it\u2019s close enough.   Now, that \u201cpull\u201d doesn\u2019t have to travel through any matter. It\u2019s not like the magnet is sending a pulse through the air telling the iron to come towards it. The magnetic field fills up all of \u201cempty\u201d space, so a magnet could pull iron even in empty space, without any air.   Now, another thing to understand is that the magnetic field, what we were just talking about, and the electric field, which makes charged particles attract/repel each other, are connected. The important bit here is that when a magnetic field changes, it causes the electric field nearby to change as well.   That means that if you cause a change in the magnetic field, say by moving a magnet away, that change will cause a pulse in the electric field.   Where it gets weird is that changes in the electric field do the same thing. When you change the electric field, it will cause a magnetic field to appear.   So, let\u2019s say you move a magnet away quickly. That will cause the magnetic field in the area to drop off suddenly. That change in the magnetic field will make a pulse in the electric field just ahead of it. But now, if the electric field just pulsed, that means it changed, and a changing electric field causes a magnetic field. So that pulse in the electric field causes its own pulse in the magnetic field just ahead. Again though, the magnetic field just changed, so you get an electric pulse. The electric pulse causes a magnetic pulse, which causes an electric pulse, which causes a magnetic pulse, which causes\u2026  Anyway, you can see how that makes a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields propagate along through space.   Btw, wiggling a magnet does actually make light, but you can\u2019t wiggle it fast enough to make visible light, sadly. You can make some really low energy radio waves though!  **TL;DR** *Light isn\u2019t a matter wave, it\u2019s an electromagnetic wave that propagates through electric and magnetic fields. \u201cEmpty\u201d space isn\u2019t actually empty, and it still has those fields in it, so light can wiggle its way through those fields to travel in space*",

    "answer": "\\[EDIT: Oh wow! My first silver! Thank you, you glorious human! OMG! Two silvers! You people are simply majestic!\\]  I work as a Library Tech at a large metropolitan library. My dept does the purchasing and assignment to branches of purchased items - books, ebooks, audiobooks, CDs, DVDs, you name it.  The short answer is that publishers don't sell the electronic items to libraries, they license them with certain conditions; To offer 6 copies for circulation we have to buy 6 licenses, usually at a rate much higher than you could buy it through Amazon. Each of these licenses are single-use, meaning only one check-out at a time is allowed.  But wait! There's more!  Part of the purchase license is a limit to how many times that one licensed ebook can be circulated - and that's often a rather small number. So those 6 copies/licenses, maybe each can only circ 10 times, so really we only get 60 circs out of it. If the ebook is popular and the item keeps getting reserves on it, then we have to keep buying licenses.  Now our regular paper books, which we buy at a price just higher than retail (often reinforced bindings) can circ 20 or more times before they fall apart, so the license model means we pay significantly more per circ.  For us, as a library, and ebook, audiobook, or any other electronic item ISN'T any different that a paper book. We catalog and track them in exactly the same way. Not because it's easier or anything, but because book/item circulation is the most important metric we use in both funding and budget planning. When you do several million circs per year it's nescessary info.  If you're interested in the effect e-publishers have had on public libraries I wrote a post in r/books a couple months ago [related to ebooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lj0ej2/publishers_need_to_know_that_if_readers_have_to/gnav1o4/?context=3).",

    "question": "ELI5: Can somebody explain to me bullet calibers?",
    "answer": "The other two comments nailed the whole metric versus imperial thing, but its actually a fair bit more complex than that. Never fear, I'm your friendly neighborhood gun guy.  \"50 cal\" is a term that most people attribute to .50 BMG, but .50 BMG is definitely not the only .50 caliber cartridge. The reason that most calibers have either a military designation (5.56x45mm, 7.62x39mm) or a word after the caliber designation is because no two calibers are exactly the same.  In the case of x.xx*xx mm, those are military designations, usually NATO. They denote the diameter of the bullet, and the length of the brass case. But for more Imperial calibers, you'll see \".30-06 Springfield,\" \".270 Winchester,\" \".223 Remington,\" \"9mm Parabellum,\" \".45 ACP,\" etc.  The diameter of the bullet is a small part of the equation. For example, there is 9x19mm, aka 9mm Parabellum, or just 9mm. But there are tons of calibers with a 9mm diameter bullet. .380 Auto, .357 Magnum, 9x18 Makarov, 9x39 Soviet, etc. The differences come from case length and design, and powder load. More powder with the same bullet means more force on target.  You would be correct in saying, \".45 ACP is a bigger bullet than 5.56.\" But 45 ACP is designed for handguns, and as such has a shorter case and smaller powder load. This helps keep the guns, well, handguns, and helps with controllability under recoil.  There are probably thousands of \"30 cal\" calibers in this world, and they do not all perform the same, and most likely won't fit and fire safely in guns not specifically marked for them.  .50 BMG is probably the largest caliber that you can own without filling out paperwork for a Destructive Device from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Because somebody decided at some point that any firearm with a bore larger than half an inch was essentially a cannon.  When looking at terminal ballistics (how good is this bullet at breaking that thing), you have to take into consideration bullet size, bullet weight, and powder load at a minimum. 9mm has a smaller powder load than 45 ACP, and pushes a smaller bullet (about half the weight) about 30% faster. 5.56 on the other hand, is basically pushing a .22 at 2800-3100 feet per second, around 3x as fast as the 9mm.  What could help you greatly in your understanding is to go on the interwebs and find a picture of a few calibers side by side. The difference in power should be self explanatory with a visual  Try this as a resource: https://www.pewpewtactical.com/bullet-sizes-calibers-and-types/",

    "answer": "Computers follow a series of instructions. They do each step before performing the next. In a single-threaded environment, if one instruction takes a long time, it holds up the entire process.  Multithreading gives sets of instructions which can be run in parallel. If you have multiple CPUs or if the CPU has multiple cores, it can give each one its own set of instructions so they can really be done at the same time. Even if not, a single CPU can switch back and forth between multiple threads, making a little progress on one before switching to the other.  A standard example in programming is with the user interface. Say you click on a button that does some sort of long-running analysis. With a single-threaded application, as soon as you push the button, all the tasks used to keep the user interface responsive are held up. The button look like it is still pressed even after you let go of the mouse, and you can't move the window or press any other control in the interface until the analysis is complete. In a multi-threaded environment, the analysis would be put on another thread. It can do its thing while the thread that keeps the user interface responsive does its job as well.",

    "answer": "A company needs orders from its owners, the shareholders, to be allowed to do something like that. This is called a stock buyback and is one way for shareholders to get cash from their company. What happens to these shares is that their control is delegated to the remaining shareholders. Often these shares are dissolved and just seize to exist. It is not possible for a company to own all of its own shares. The company can not actually own anything as such, they are only managing the assets owned by their shareholders. All the assets in the company are actually the assets of the shareholders in a roundabout way. So you can not give all the shares to the company itself because you would then be giving it back to yourself.",

If you line these cells up, the difference gets added (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, etc). And eels have lots of them, and when added up together, comes up to about 500 to 600 volts.  Using complex bio chemistry, these eels can either, charge up the cells, hold charge, or discharge.   When they discharge, they allow electrical difference to flow from one cell to another, but as they are in a line, the electrical difference will have to flow through the water, from one end of the line, to the other end.

    "question": "ELI5: How does a folded sheet of paper 42X be the distance to the moon?",
    "answer": "Each time you fold a sheet of paper it doubles in size. Obviously you can't ACTUALLY fold a sheet of paper 42 times, but if you could, here's how it would work:  if 500 sheets of paper are about 2\" as you say, 1 sheet would be 0.004 inches.  1 fold would make 0.008 inches (0.004 * 2^1)  2 folds would make 0.016 inches (0.004 * 2^2)  so 42 folds is 0.004 * 2^42 = 17592186044.4 inches = 277,654.45 miles.  The distance to the moon is 238,855 miles (give or take, depending on orbit)",

    "question": "Eli5: Who exactly messed up in the Grenfell cladding?",
    "answer": "In engineering risk assessment there is a theory called the cheese model. Imagine many slices of cheese, each with some holes in random positions. Each slice of cheese represents one entity in the engineering project, and holes represent safety holes in that one entity. A risk factor (hole) in one entity can be blocked by another entity. However, sometimes you're unlucky and all the holes align. Everything is at the wrong place at the same time, and disaster happens.   Truth is, humans *will* make mistakes. It is unavoidable. Any attempts to reduce risk *will* cause risks of its own. The best we can do is to have many layers of cheese (safety mechanism) so that the chance of holes aligning (all safety mechanisms failing) is as small as possible. The desire to blame a single entity for disasters is not only wrong, but also makes the entire system prone to future disasters. If we only blame one slice of cheese for the entire disaster, problems in every other slice of cheese is not fixed, or even worse, those holes get larger due to complacency.",
    "follow-up": "Yes, but surely at least one of the factors I mentioned should be major factor? If the standards were perfect, the panels accurately tested and properly installed, and the appropriate cladding was used this wouldn't have happened? This wasn't a freak accident, this was a known issue with this type of cladding that has been reproduced elsewhere and has caused other fires before and after - although none as dramatic.   I get that most engineering disasters nowadays cannot be narrowed down to such a small amount of issues - but this seems to be an exception to the rule. This sort of fire was, with the benefit of hindsight, entirely predictable based on the pre existing conditions wasn't it?  Edit: Another comment said the window frames were responsible - if it is indeed something of that sort, it seems its a lot less clear cut then I thought and this does apply.",
