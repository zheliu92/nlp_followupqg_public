      "answer": "Because you have probably heard different people speaking with different accents.  This may be from family, friends, neighbours, strangers in the street, people in movies.  Depending on where you live, this could be just a few, or many different accents.   You have both decided, maybe without realizing it, to pick a certain accent, for certain sounds.  I would guess that your basic accent \u201con a base level\u201d is the same as the other people in your family and neighbourhood. You might deviate slightly for certain sounds, which is where your personal choice comes in.  But then there are a few words, like \u201cscone\u201d, which none of us seem to agree on how to pronounce.  2 people with identical accents might argue over how to pronounce scone - does it rhyme with cone or gone?",

For me, a side stitch comes about from stomach muscles not being synchronized with breathing. Think of it as your chest muscles pulling up as your abdominal muscles pull down. I'm sure that's not technically correct, but that's the effect you experience when the muscles are strained. It can be eliminated/reduced by concentrating on breathing on one side or the other, generally your dominant side. When that foot strikes the ground, you want to be exhaling.

      "question": "ELI5 How does sound wave energy get converted into electricity and why is it less efficient than solar energy?",
      "answer": "The microphone reflects *a lot* of the sound energy that hits it.  Your simple microphone is like a tiny speaker in reverse where sound hits the diaphragm (little movable plate) and pushes a magnet in and out of a coil of wire.  This little diaphragm is hard on the surface which means that a lot of the sound energy hits it and bounces off rather than being absorbed in pushing the magnet through the coil.  There are little capacitor based ones but the magnet setup is easiest to understand as a reversed speaker.  Solar panels on the other hand are very absorbant of the frequencies they work with.  Some percentage is reflected off the top glass layer but 90% of the light will pass through and then be absorbed down below.  The efficiency of solar panels mostly comes down to the sun emitting light over a wide range of frequencies and our little solar panels only being able to absorb a small range of frequencies which is why the best case efficiency of a single junction solar panel is just 37% because that's the bigger window we can make in the highest energy portion of the sun's spectrum.  Another issue with capturing sound energy is that there just really isn't all that much of it.  If you were to stand 1 meter away from a jet engine its sound level is around 150 dB, but if you were to capture *all* the sound energy from that jet engine it'd be around 1000 W, a 150 dB sound only gives you 1000 W of energy to work with.  You can get that much energy with about 5 m^2 of solar panels and you won't have a giant turbofan engine screaming away in the background.",
      "follow-up": "Gotcha, that makes a lot of sense! So it's a combination of inefficient sound capturing (would need a VERY sensitive diaphragm) and the general low dBs that could be captured.. Would there be some sort of way to boost the dB frequency just before it reaches the diaphragm yet contain it in a way that doesn't actually (noise) pollute the surrounding area? Also is there any possibility to leverage a sort of \"gear reduction\" (obviously not gears themselves, but the principle of reduced effort or whatever) that could amplify the dB level?

An object can have also attributes (src and alt are attributes of the img element object; \"This is text\" is the text attribute of the p element object).

      "question": "ELI5: What is this magical amount of enriched uranium that is needed for a nuclear bomb?; Part 2: Why is it that amount?; Bonus: how close is Iran to that amount?",
      "answer": "It's not magic. A nuclear bomb is an engineering device that creates the conditions for an out-of-control nuclear fission reaction.   Each U-235 atom can be split (fissioned) with a neutron. When it splits, it releases 2-3 neutrons of its own (plus some energy). Each neutron can go only a few centimeters before it disintegrates. For a bomb to work, you need those 2-3 neutrons to split more U-235 atoms, which then split more, which then split more, and so on.   If the amount of uranium you have is too small, the neutrons will eventually reach the surface and escape. The chances of them hitting more U-235 atoms will not be high enough to continue the reaction.  So the \"magic amount\" \u2014\u00a0the critical mass \u2014 is the amount of U-235 you need so that you have the conditions where lots of reactions will take place.   The thing of it is, there are different ways to design a bomb. For example, if you put a neutron reflector around the fuel, those neutrons will have a harder time escaping, so you will need less U-235 for it to work. The main bomb design \"trick\" that people use is called implosion, where you use high explosives to squeeze a ball of fuel into a higher density, so the atoms are closer together \u2014 again, to increase the chance of those neutrons finding more atoms.   There are other tricks as well that can be used to increase the efficiency, many of which get beyond ELI5 levels of explanation. The goal of them is to make more material react, which either means you need less material for a given amount of \"boom,\" or you add more fuel and get a bigger explosion.  So the exact amount you need can vary by bomb design. The lower limits are kept pretty secret but it is clear that with 5 kg or even less of material, with a very sophisticated design, you can get a pretty good explosion. For a very crude design, like the one used on Hiroshima (where you are just shooting two pieces of U-235 together), you could need more than 60 kg. So there is a big gap between those two extremes, though in the end even the \"high end\" is not a huge amount.   Separately, with U-235, the level of enrichment (how much U-235 versus U-238 there is) makes a difference to that amount as well. If you have 93% U-235 (7% U-238), you will need less material than, say, 80% U-235 (20% U-238). U-238 inhibits the reaction and so you will need more U-235 to increase the chance of it fissioning.  If this still sounds confusing, you might enjoy playing around with my [Critical Assembly Simulator](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/misc/criticality/), which allows one to simulate in a \"toy\" way how these reactions work. You can tweak the variables (enrichment, total mass, reflection, implosion, etc.) and see how that changes how the reaction operates.   In terms of how close Iran is to the amount, Iran currently has uranium enriched at the level of 20%. That is not enough for a bomb. It is, however, not that far from 90% \u2014\u00a0a lot less far than it seems (enrichment is not linear; it is more \"work\" to go from 0.7% to 20% than it is 20% to 90%).   To make a bomb, Iran would likely need to build up a stockpile of several dozen kilograms of uranium enriched to at least 80%, more favorable at least 90%. They have said that they will make at most 120 kg of 20% enriched uranium. If they turned all of that into 90% enriched uranium with perfect efficiency, they would have around 25 kg of U-235. That would likely be enough for a few implosion bombs (but not enough for a crude bomb). They would also of course have to do the work of weaponizing it, and need a way to actually launch it (missile warheads, etc.) \u2014 not impossible, but these things take additional time and testing.   In terms of \"how close,\" it really depends on what you assume they are going to be doing politically. They do not appear to be trying to make a bomb just yet. They are clearly positioning themselves to make the West uncomfortable, though, with the idea that if they threw everything they had into making a bomb \u2014 which would be a very obvious sort of move, and require them flagrantly violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \u2014 they might be able to make the material in a matter of months.   Note that Iran's uranium stockpiles and facilities are under close scrutiny not only by the International Atomic Energy Agency (which has cameras in each of them, linked back to their headquarters in Vienna), but the intelligence services of many nations (USA, Israel, no doubt others). So this would be a very blatant act. It doesn't mean they couldn't try it (North Korea pulled out of the NPT in 2003, and tested a bomb in 2006), but it is not the kind of overnight \"they suddenly secretly have a nuke\" that many people fear.",

      "question": "ELI5: What is this magical amount of enriched uranium that is needed for a nuclear bomb?; Part 2: Why is it that amount?; Bonus: how close is Iran to that amount?",
      "answer": "It's not magic. A nuclear bomb is an engineering device that creates the conditions for an out-of-control nuclear fission reaction.   Each U-235 atom can be split (fissioned) with a neutron. When it splits, it releases 2-3 neutrons of its own (plus some energy). Each neutron can go only a few centimeters before it disintegrates. For a bomb to work, you need those 2-3 neutrons to split more U-235 atoms, which then split more, which then split more, and so on.   If the amount of uranium you have is too small, the neutrons will eventually reach the surface and escape. The chances of them hitting more U-235 atoms will not be high enough to continue the reaction.  So the \"magic amount\" \u2014\u00a0the critical mass \u2014 is the amount of U-235 you need so that you have the conditions where lots of reactions will take place.   The thing of it is, there are different ways to design a bomb. For example, if you put a neutron reflector around the fuel, those neutrons will have a harder time escaping, so you will need less U-235 for it to work. The main bomb design \"trick\" that people use is called implosion, where you use high explosives to squeeze a ball of fuel into a higher density, so the atoms are closer together \u2014 again, to increase the chance of those neutrons finding more atoms.   There are other tricks as well that can be used to increase the efficiency, many of which get beyond ELI5 levels of explanation. The goal of them is to make more material react, which either means you need less material for a given amount of \"boom,\" or you add more fuel and get a bigger explosion.  So the exact amount you need can vary by bomb design. The lower limits are kept pretty secret but it is clear that with 5 kg or even less of material, with a very sophisticated design, you can get a pretty good explosion. For a very crude design, like the one used on Hiroshima (where you are just shooting two pieces of U-235 together), you could need more than 60 kg. So there is a big gap between those two extremes, though in the end even the \"high end\" is not a huge amount.   Separately, with U-235, the level of enrichment (how much U-235 versus U-238 there is) makes a difference to that amount as well. If you have 93% U-235 (7% U-238), you will need less material than, say, 80% U-235 (20% U-238). U-238 inhibits the reaction and so you will need more U-235 to increase the chance of it fissioning.  If this still sounds confusing, you might enjoy playing around with my [Critical Assembly Simulator](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/misc/criticality/), which allows one to simulate in a \"toy\" way how these reactions work. You can tweak the variables (enrichment, total mass, reflection, implosion, etc.) and see how that changes how the reaction operates.   In terms of how close Iran is to the amount, Iran currently has uranium enriched at the level of 20%. That is not enough for a bomb. It is, however, not that far from 90% \u2014\u00a0a lot less far than it seems (enrichment is not linear; it is more \"work\" to go from 0.7% to 20% than it is 20% to 90%).   To make a bomb, Iran would likely need to build up a stockpile of several dozen kilograms of uranium enriched to at least 80%, more favorable at least 90%. They have said that they will make at most 120 kg of 20% enriched uranium. If they turned all of that into 90% enriched uranium with perfect efficiency, they would have around 25 kg of U-235. That would likely be enough for a few implosion bombs (but not enough for a crude bomb). They would also of course have to do the work of weaponizing it, and need a way to actually launch it (missile warheads, etc.) \u2014 not impossible, but these things take additional time and testing.

      "question": "ELI5: How come nothing is done for gun control when mass shootings are becoming so frighteningly common ?",
      "answer": "\"Frighteningly\" is an emotional response and it's driven by overwhelmingly biased media coverage. Mass shootings are actually quite rare, and their associated death tolls pale in comparison to things that are otherwise seemingly benign. The biggest reason why gun control measures aren't passed is because liberal politicians that craft the legislation have a fundamental lack of knowledge on how guns are designed/manufactured/operated. Without understanding firearms, the relative proportion of ownership, and how their laws impact the general populace, many (if not most) of their legislative proposals are just terribly written.

      "answer": "Two things: first, many plants *can't* be easily grown hydroponically.  Second is that the difference between soil and hydroponics is more than just \"replace dirt with water\". Hydroponics systems tend to have highly managed biochemistry making sure the plants get exactly the nutrients they need and nothing else. Soil, on the other hand, is a natural environment which contains not only all sorts of minerals and chemicals but also living creatures like bacteria, fungi, even insects. It's naturally balanced to support the plant, but if you disturb that balance (for example, by adding way more water than it would naturally get), it stops being a good environment for plant growth. Minerals could be overextracted or washed away. Organisms could be drowned or could overpopulate and invade. It's simply not managed in the same way a hydroponics system is managed.",
      "follow-up": "> It's naturally balanced to support the plant, but if you disturb that balance (for example, by adding way more water than it would naturally get), it stops being a good environment for plant growth.   This is the best answer.  Both systems (soil/hydroponics) require some form of balance and maintenance. Things like ph, oxygenation, nutrient content matter to both systems.  It's not that water is inherently evil. What the OP's question actually is is \"why is it when I knock my soil system out of whack/balance it damages plants when my carefully maintained hydroponic system doesn't\".  The answer is inherent to the question.  Put differently  \"Why can plants grow just fine in soil when if I add too many minerals and nutrients to my hydroponic system it'll damage them?\"",

      "answer": "Two things: first, many plants *can't* be easily grown hydroponically.  Second is that the difference between soil and hydroponics is more than just \"replace dirt with water\". Hydroponics systems tend to have highly managed biochemistry making sure the plants get exactly the nutrients they need and nothing else. Soil, on the other hand, is a natural environment which contains not only all sorts of minerals and chemicals but also living creatures like bacteria, fungi, even insects. It's naturally balanced to support the plant, but if you disturb that balance (for example, by adding way more water than it would naturally get), it stops being a good environment for plant growth. Minerals could be overextracted or washed away. Organisms could be drowned or could overpopulate and invade. It's simply not managed in the same way a hydroponics system is managed.",

Supersampling renders an image at a higher resolution than the computer screen can output, takes an average of the pixel colors in an area and blends them all together, displaying the blended colors at the native resolution. This sort of smooths the edges of those not perfectly straight lines so that they appear less jagged and more natural.

      "answer": "The simplest explanation is that dentistry and optometristry are more about tools and minimally invasive procedures than they are about internal biology. They don't actually perform surgery, and if surgery is needed they refer their patients to actual M.D.s to either diagnose more complicated issues or perform surgeries.  They don't need to worry about things that don't involve the procedures they do, and they really only diagnose things that they can see with a quick look(measurement of eyesight/astigmatism, abcess/cavity/etc.) and do what is needed to correct them right then and there, whether it's a root canal or determining the correct lens strength. They don't need to know the workings of the body to do these things, they're only interested in the things that relate to the procedures they do.  They can only use anesthesia if they are trained in it, and it's not only doctors that can use it. If the dentist isn't trained in it, he can have a CRNA that is to administer it.

They got for an other type of Bankruptcy that says\" I could pay the debt by selling my stuff now but finding a buyer for all of it this fast would mean taking any very low offer that could bankrupt me soon after.

A Pescatarian is someone who eats a vegetarian diet + fish and other seafood, but no meat from other animals.

If you have a really long, thin water hose, the flow rate is going to be the same along the entire length, but the pressure at the end won't be so great.",

The answer is that the energy required to do this is greater than the energy you get out of it, so you'd burn more gas than you get.

      "answer": "The choice of electrons as negative was *not* just arbitrary. When early experiments were done before electrons were discovered, it was shown that electricity moves from positive towards negative. This seems counterintuitive at first, because it's the electrons that are moving, right? So electrons are moving from negative to positive, but the *charge* is moving from positive to negative.  Imagine a long line of cars sitting at a red light. When the light turns green, the car at the front of the line moves first. Even though the cars are coming from the back and moving forward, the apparent movement of the *whole line* of cars starts at the front. If you couldn't see individual cars, and they were all the same color, you would see just one long line of *something*. When the first car moves, it would open up a gap or a *hole* behind that car, which the next car would move up to fill. If you were in a helicopter and you had very blurry vision, you'd probably notice that hole appearing to move.  Similarly, when electrons move they leave behind a positively charged \"hole\". Before any electron can move, there has to be a hole in font of it. And when you do math and make models and predictions, you can pretend that the hole acts like a positively charged particle, because it kind of moves around like one. Instead of an electron jumping around, it *looks* like there's a positively charged particle jumping around. Keep in mind that unlike cars, electrons don't slowly travel from one atom to the next: instead, they are around one atom, and then they just *are* at a different atom. They jump across the gap without appearing to move (although they do take time to get there). So without seeing the electrons move individually, it really does look like an overall positive charge is the thing moving.  Thus, early experiments showed that charge came from the end that they labeled as *positive*. After generations, the electron was found but by then the convention was already set, so electrons were stuck as being labeled *negative*. As for why charged particles have charge at all - it's an intrinsic part of the universe and how those particles interact with it. They just kind of...do.",

      "answer": "Billionaires aren't avoiding taxes, so much as paying a small portion of their wealth in taxes because they only liquidate a small amount to live off of, and capital gains taxes are lower than income tax rates.  Let's say I founded XYZ Corp. and I hold shares worth $50B. I take $1/yr in salary. I sell $50M worth of shares each year, and pay capital gains taxes on those. Highest capital gains tax rate is 20%. So if I sell $50M (and assume basically $0 initial cost), then I'd pay $10M in taxes. No matter how valuable my shares become, I only pay taxes when I sell, so if my shares were only worth $25B last year and are now worth $50B , there is no taxable event on that new $25B in wealth.  But wealthy can also borrow money rather than sell off shares, using those shares as collateral. Maybe I borrowed $50M to live off of last year instead of selling shares, paying a low interest rate due to my super low default  risk. Maybe it's 3% annually. Meanwhile, my money in my shares are growing at a much faster rate than that. I can basically keep just paying interest only on amount borrowed, take out new loans, etc. to keep money in my metaphorical pocket without liquidating shares of stock that would require paying capital gains. At some point, I will eventually sell and pay taxes, but presumably have gains on the shares that outweighs the taxes and interest.",

      "answer": "Billionaires aren't avoiding taxes, so much as paying a small portion of their wealth in taxes because they only liquidate a small amount to live off of, and capital gains taxes are lower than income tax rates.  Let's say I founded XYZ Corp. and I hold shares worth $50B. I take $1/yr in salary. I sell $50M worth of shares each year, and pay capital gains taxes on those. Highest capital gains tax rate is 20%. So if I sell $50M (and assume basically $0 initial cost), then I'd pay $10M in taxes. No matter how valuable my shares become, I only pay taxes when I sell, so if my shares were only worth $25B last year and are now worth $50B , there is no taxable event on that new $25B in wealth.  But wealthy can also borrow money rather than sell off shares, using those shares as collateral. Maybe I borrowed $50M to live off of last year instead of selling shares, paying a low interest rate due to my super low default  risk. Maybe it's 3% annually. Meanwhile, my money in my shares are growing at a much faster rate than that. I can basically keep just paying interest only on amount borrowed, take out new loans, etc. to keep money in my metaphorical pocket without liquidating shares of stock that would require paying capital gains.

The note buys equity in your company... but not now, it buys it at some point in the future (generally on your next round of funding).

That is--you never pay out the loan in cash, its paid off in stock, later. Think of it as getting money now, for selling stock in the future.  For example, a convertible note for $50k at 20% means the owner of the company gets $50k now, and will have to give away $50k + 20% interest in equity later.  Lets say in exactly 1 year, you close out the note and give the equity.  You'd give out $60k in equity ($50k + 20% of $50k).  Convertible notes are great when its hard to judge the valuation of a company now, but you will be able to later, it also keeps equity control of the company with the owner and avoid a lot of really complicated financial and legal process of issuing shares.  Convertible notes are often the name of the game for new companies looking to sell equity.

      "answer": "Fundamental conceptually innaccurate understanding of light. Light has no speed.  If youre reading a blank book, but letters appear on the page as soon as you turn the page and can see them. Do they have a speed?  They appear at the speed you turn the page, not of their own innate properties. This is not a 'speed' but a characteristic defined by something else.    ELI5; Light doesnt move. It exists everywhere along its path as soon as its created. What you call speed of light, is the maximum speed we can change something in the universe. The speed of causality.  Because light exists everywhere along its path, theres nothing to slow down. Thats your answer.      ELI15; This is a fundamental conceptual misunderstanding. All the documentaries, science books etc would do well to change \"speed of light\" to \"speed of causality\" per Einstein.  Light does not travel in the sense we think about.  Light exists in a line along its path immediately upon being created.  When someone says light speed is X, what they mean is the speed of causality is X. The speed at which anything can experience a change in information.  So you might say? Well, isnt that the same? No, because light exists immediately along a trajectory, it doesnt have a mass to slow down. It isn't moving like how we innately understand movement.  Counter to this is light slowing in a medium. Dont be confused. 2 different mediums are being discussed. One medium actually slows causality. The other medium does not slow causality.  1. Light appears slower in a gravity well, this is a type of medium. This is because causality slows. The rate at which our reality can experience a change in data slows.  2.  Light appears to slow in a crystal or other object, because it physically interacts, is absorbed, re-emitted. Basically bounces around causing it to \"appear slowed\" .

No, because light exists immediately along a trajectory, it doesnt have a mass to slow down. It isn't moving like how we innately understand movement.  Counter to this is light slowing in a medium. Dont be confused. 2 different mediums are being discussed. One medium actually slows causality. The other medium does not slow causality.  1. Light appears slower in a gravity well, this is a type of medium. This is because causality slows. The rate at which our reality can experience a change in data slows.  2.  Light appears to slow in a crystal or other object, because it physically interacts, is absorbed, re-emitted. Basically bounces around causing it to \"appear slowed\" .

      "question": "ELI5: How bad actually are the long term effects of alcohol, marijuana and acid for example, on younger people?",
      "answer": "Drugs damage you mainly on two fronts.  Alcohol is dangerous, because it destroys your body. It is a highly potent toxin and in the process of removing it the body hurts itself. Not as much as you would notice, but over years of constant use, everybody can see the difference to a non-drinker. So alcohol basically decays you slowly.   For the specific scenario of drinking every couple of months it will probably take a lot of time until noticeable defects show themselves, but you will be at higher risk for things like liver failure, than someone who doesn't drink.  Acid or LSD is a psychoactive drug. It is heavily dependent on the psyche of the user, to what happens after consuming it. It may be depicted as one of the more harmless drugs, but that appearance is deceptive. Any psychoactive drug and especially LSD has the potential to cause a psychosis any time you consume it.  So if someone, especially with a developing brain would take LSD, even if it only were every couple of months, that development could be stunted and will be influenced. A higher chance for a permanent psychosis is guaranteed here.   Cannabis is the mixed bag of drugs and widely inconsistent, not only the drug itself, but also how it is consumed.  You can eat, smoke or inhale it, and with pure THC you have even more possibilities. Todays Cannabis also has hundreds if not thousands of different strains that all vary in in drug composition and strength. There are hundreds of cannabinoids in cannabis and they all interact and influence the trip.  So first we have the way to consume it. A vaporizer is the safest way, since it allows you to release the cannabinoids without burning the Cannabis and releasing harmful smoke and byproducts. Then you have eating, where your body has the chance to clean out anything it doesn't want in there, but you consume the whole plant. Lastly smoking fills your lung with additional toxins and kills your bronchi.  Then the drug itself has the same potential of any psychoactive drug to cause psychosis. Cannabis itself has been shown to impact short-term memory and especially trigger underlying conditions of schizophrenia., especially in developing brians.  For your scenario, you would notice differences between someone who never smoked and someone who consumed Cannabis. The damages to short-term memory are permanent and will stunt the development of the brain.  &#x200B;  Lastly, it has to be said that drugs are never safe. You can safely trip on acid ten times and then take a lower dose the eleventh time and still have negative side effects. Our body is far too complicated and these drugs have a tremendous impact on our whole body chemistry every time we consume them, to reliably say what they would cause every time.",

      "answer": "Drugs damage you mainly on two fronts.  Alcohol is dangerous, because it destroys your body. It is a highly potent toxin and in the process of removing it the body hurts itself. Not as much as you would notice, but over years of constant use, everybody can see the difference to a non-drinker. So alcohol basically decays you slowly.   For the specific scenario of drinking every couple of months it will probably take a lot of time until noticeable defects show themselves, but you will be at higher risk for things like liver failure, than someone who doesn't drink.  Acid or LSD is a psychoactive drug. It is heavily dependent on the psyche of the user, to what happens after consuming it. It may be depicted as one of the more harmless drugs, but that appearance is deceptive. Any psychoactive drug and especially LSD has the potential to cause a psychosis any time you consume it.  So if someone, especially with a developing brain would take LSD, even if it only were every couple of months, that development could be stunted and will be influenced. A higher chance for a permanent psychosis is guaranteed here.   Cannabis is the mixed bag of drugs and widely inconsistent, not only the drug itself, but also how it is consumed.  You can eat, smoke or inhale it, and with pure THC you have even more possibilities. Todays Cannabis also has hundreds if not thousands of different strains that all vary in in drug composition and strength. There are hundreds of cannabinoids in cannabis and they all interact and influence the trip.  So first we have the way to consume it. A vaporizer is the safest way, since it allows you to release the cannabinoids without burning the Cannabis and releasing harmful smoke and byproducts. Then you have eating, where your body has the chance to clean out anything it doesn't want in there, but you consume the whole plant. Lastly smoking fills your lung with additional toxins and kills your bronchi.  Then the drug itself has the same potential of any psychoactive drug to cause psychosis. Cannabis itself has been shown to impact short-term memory and especially trigger underlying conditions of schizophrenia., especially in developing brians.  For your scenario, you would notice differences between someone who never smoked and someone who consumed Cannabis. The damages to short-term memory are permanent and will stunt the development of the brain.  &#x200B;  Lastly, it has to be said that drugs are never safe. You can safely trip on acid ten times and then take a lower dose the eleventh time and still have negative side effects. Our body is far too complicated and these drugs have a tremendous impact on our whole body chemistry every time we consume them, to reliably say what they would cause every time.",

      "answer": "A *decent* analogy is theme to the bladerunner short, 'Blackout 2022':  The replicants know they need to destroy the database that stores all of their names and personal information, while simultaneously blowing up the facility that backs up that information (in case something happens to the first facility). However, there's only a small window in-time in which it's possible to destroy both (when the cockroach molts).  There's 2 strands of DNA and one of those strands can fix the other if it takes damage; just think of the cockroach as always being able to back up the first strain when you damage it, but when it's molting the strands separate temporarily, and could both be damaged simultaneously, with no backups.

      "answer": "Your digestive tract is essentially a tube going through your body. It's where elements from outside of your body have an opportunity to go inside your body. A strong digestive tract prevents this.  Between the cells that line your intestines, you have something called tight-junction. When your tight-junction become damaged, they allow gaps to form between the cells of your intestines.  Then, bacteria and molecules from foods that you eat can enter into your bloodstream, which will cause a heightened immune-state.  Your immune system starts attacking a lot more things because it's always on high alert because of potential toxins floating around in your bloodstream.   I used to have bad pollen allergies. Watery eyes and constant sneezing. It last for a few years. Then one year I started intermittent and long-term fasting. I stopped having allergies that year.  Then I switched to a keto diet, and remain unaffected by pollen. But if I start eating a lot of junk food and crap during allergy season, my eyes start itching again .  Certain foods damage the tight junction in your digestive tract. You can test the permeability of your intestines with the PEG400 test.

      "answer": "Calls and Puts are options.   An option is a contract that allows you use buy or sell something at a specific price until a specific date. Call means buy, Put means sell.   An example: If you have a 800$ call ending on 19. march you have the option to buy 100 stocks until the 19th for 800$ each. So if the stock price on that date is 500$ it wouldn\u2019t make sense to execute it. But if it\u2019s 2000$ it would make sense to execute it because if you instantly sell them you\u2019d make good profit.",

      "answer": "We as a sociaty do want journalists to be able to freely talk to criminals so that we can get a fair view of the world we live in. We therefore grant journalists the same rights as doctors and priests to not have to disclose secrets about crimes and criminals. This is so that the criminals can be able to trust these people with secret information. There is of course limits to this right and journalists can not be part of a crime or in a possition where they can prevent the crime from taking place. There may also be more specific laws depending on the legislation.  It does not mean that it is easy for journalists to find criminals to interview.  There is a reason wanted criminals have not been caught. So a journalist might need some time to gain the confidence of the criminal networks they are making a story about. Investigative journalism takes a lot of time because of things like this. You might even see the journalist having to publish whatever they have and first then start to gain the confidence of the people higher up. Trust also goes both ways and the journalist have to make sure that the criminals are who they say they are and that they will not do harm to them. Journalists have been kidnapped or even killed when investigating criminals they trusted. It is also common for journalists to get a lot of information that they can not publish yet because it would be unfair to the criminals involved. So an article or a documentary might have to sit on the shelf for months or even years before it can be published. In order for the criminals to be able to trust the journalist there can not be any information published that the police find useful. Even if there is some useful pieces of information to the police they can not trust that it is accurate since it may be embelished or distorted information at that point.",

      "answer": "We as a sociaty do want journalists to be able to freely talk to criminals so that we can get a fair view of the world we live in. We therefore grant journalists the same rights as doctors and priests to not have to disclose secrets about crimes and criminals. This is so that the criminals can be able to trust these people with secret information. There is of course limits to this right and journalists can not be part of a crime or in a possition where they can prevent the crime from taking place. There may also be more specific laws depending on the legislation.  It does not mean that it is easy for journalists to find criminals to interview.  There is a reason wanted criminals have not been caught. So a journalist might need some time to gain the confidence of the criminal networks they are making a story about. Investigative journalism takes a lot of time because of things like this. You might even see the journalist having to publish whatever they have and first then start to gain the confidence of the people higher up. Trust also goes both ways and the journalist have to make sure that the criminals are who they say they are and that they will not do harm to them. Journalists have been kidnapped or even killed when investigating criminals they trusted. It is also common for journalists to get a lot of information that they can not publish yet because it would be unfair to the criminals involved. So an article or a documentary might have to sit on the shelf for months or even years before it can be published. In order for the criminals to be able to trust the journalist there can not be any information published that the police find useful.

      "question": "ELI5: What happens when there's too much honey in a bee hive but there's no one to collect it?",
      "answer": "They call this condition \"honeybound\"  Queens need open cells to lay eggs... If a colony becomes too cramped in their hive they will create a new set of queens and all the oldest bees and the old queen fly away to start a new hive in some other new space.. the young bees remain behind taking care of the new queens and new baby bees... the new queens have fatal duels until only one remains... typically if the first queen to emerge is healthy she will be allowed to go kill the other queens  before they escape their cocoons... if the best queen is slow to emerge workers will protect that area from a lesser but quicker to emerge queen who would certainly eliminate that better competition given the opportunity.  If the space is extremely cramped or the colony exceptionally populous, they may also send a couple more swarms with newly emerged queens rather than having them duel down to one...  Ideally the best new queen takes the original colony... the old queen starts up a new hive elsewhere... if they're especially fortunate 2-3 minor swarms with new queens also begin anew.  Those minor swarms do not have great odds of survival but sometimes nature finds a way.  Update: thanks so much for all the gifts and goofy comments you all made my day = )  I've only been a bee keeper for a single season, but I take that responsibility seriously so I've tried my best to learn as much as I can so I can be a proper steward of my lil beebies.  I wouldn't call myself an expert by any means but I tell myself to learn like I'll live forever and serve like there's no tomorrow. I try to spend at least a little chunk of time learning more about bees everyday! They're fascinating and I'm a biologist so it's really a joy to learn all about them!  I'd like to encourage anyone and everyone who isn't allergic to work with bees and learn about them and help local bee keeper or become one yourself!  They're marvelous creatures and truly altruistic... working with them has been extremely rewarding and fulfilling... the hardest part is waiting for winter to pass.  As for how the bees select their favored queen? I guess that's one of their secrets, I only know about it because I've seen the way some workers guard their favorite unopened queen cell. I could scratch up a few paragraphs of ideas about factors that go into it but I'm already rambling hahaha... likely there is a lot to it.  Thanks again guys support local bee keepers and get your hands in the mix, most bee keepers are old timers and the industry needs more youthful energy and innovation!",

So getting a reliable database that didn't have to deal with many recent changes wasn't that big of a problem.  For most of the people in my family, the only reason their phone number ever changed was because the phone company had to switch to a new area code.  Neither of my grandparents nor my wife's grandparents' phone numbers had changed in 40+ years before they died.  My parents number was 20 years old when they moved because we kids moved out the house.  People these days will change their phone numbers in a heartbeat and keeping any centralized database updated with that information is challenging.",

When we spin it extremely fast it would flatten into a disc.           That's intuitive, because we're used to seeing things spin quickly.  Galaxies though, don't look to be spinning at all.  Intuitively, it seems like everything should just fall into the middle and form a sphere.         What's not intuitive is that you don't need to spin quickly if you have a lot of mass, and *galaxies have an awful lot of mass*.       Imagine we had two balls - one filled with polystyrene balls from a bean bag, the other fillled with steel ball bearings.  We spin both balls faster and faster.  The one with the ball bearings will deform sooner.  The  bulge will appear sooner and it will flatten into a disc sooner.  The more mass you're spinning  the less revolutions per minute you need to turn it into a disc.        And galaxies are spinning a *lot* of mass.           ^(Edit: fixed a spelling error)",

      "answer": "The medical industry, and specifically the medical insurance industry is very heavily regulated.  Also the US norm of having insurance tied to your job creates problems.  A solution would be to decouple insurance from employment.  If your employer provides benefits, there\u2019s a \u201ctotal compensation\u201d number somewhere on the books.  Like if your salary is 50k plus benefits, it\u2019s likely costing the company 75k to employ you.  Instead of the company providing insurance, if the compensation became just pay you 75k, but no benefits, with a more open market option for health insurance, like there is for home or auto insurance, more options could emerge.  You\u2019re someone young and healthy with no kids? Sure, here\u2019s a plan that is dirt cheap, but doesn\u2019t cover much beyond catastrophic accidents/illness.  You\u2019re married and have 3 kids? Here\u2019s a plan that costs a bit more and covers more.  You\u2019re a hypochondriac that\u2019s constantly convinced you\u2019re dying?  Here\u2019s a plan that covers everything imaginable, but you\u2019re going to have to pay a lot for it.  Another option is tort reform for lawsuits.  High risk medical fields like OB, surgeons, etc have to carry enormous levels of malpractice insurance and liability.  If they\u2019re in private practice, premiums can run into the 6 figures.  This decreases the amount of people willing to assume that level of risk, meaning shortages.  Any time there\u2019s a shortage, price goes up.  So reducing the ability to sue a doctor for millions of dollars for something that isn\u2019t blatantly their incompetence (like an injury to mom or baby when giving birth, even if all protocols and good practices were followed) could help too, because then there\u2019d be lower risk to such fields and more people would want to go into them, meaning wait times and price could go down.",

      "answer": "Computers actually use a lot more memory than just their RAM. They also set aside a portion of your disk drive(s) called a \"swap file\". If something happens and RAM gets a little low, the OS finds some portions of RAM that haven't been used lately and transfers them to the \"swap file\". That frees up RAM for what it was doing. Disks are a LOT slower than RAM, so that's why an overloaded computer gets visibly slower: it can be in a state where EVERYTHING involves moving something to or from the swap file. So long as you don't run out of disk space, you can at least run with diminished performance.  (My laptop has 16GB of RAM. It's using 12.3 of it. I'm also using 32MB of swap file, which means I'm doing pretty well right now!)  Phones don't have big disk drives to lean on for swap files. It's only recently that they've had more than about 32GB of storage to work with. If they used some of that storage for swap files, people would be mad that they can't store as many photos, apps, or songs on their phones. Further, the kind of memory they use for their \"disks\" can actually wear out if you write data to it too much. That can take years on modern devices, but it'd be a lot faster if a swap file was constantly writing to the storage!  What happens when a phone runs out of RAM then? Well, the app said it needed some memory to do something and there's no memory. So it can't do anything. If you think about it, it can't even show you an error message! To show you an error message, it'd have to get some memory to store the message. But the phone just told it there IS no memory! So the app crashes. The phone OS tries to deal with this by closing apps you've put in the background. (This is also why having 2 apps open at once is such a restricted feature that took so long to arrive.) It hopes if you haven't looked at some app in a month you won't mind if it takes longer to start up next time.   So the best solution is to put more RAM in the phone.

      "question": "ELI5: Why do we need so much ram in cell phones?",
      "answer": "Computers actually use a lot more memory than just their RAM. They also set aside a portion of your disk drive(s) called a \"swap file\". If something happens and RAM gets a little low, the OS finds some portions of RAM that haven't been used lately and transfers them to the \"swap file\". That frees up RAM for what it was doing. Disks are a LOT slower than RAM, so that's why an overloaded computer gets visibly slower: it can be in a state where EVERYTHING involves moving something to or from the swap file. So long as you don't run out of disk space, you can at least run with diminished performance.  (My laptop has 16GB of RAM. It's using 12.3 of it. I'm also using 32MB of swap file, which means I'm doing pretty well right now!)  Phones don't have big disk drives to lean on for swap files. It's only recently that they've had more than about 32GB of storage to work with. If they used some of that storage for swap files, people would be mad that they can't store as many photos, apps, or songs on their phones. Further, the kind of memory they use for their \"disks\" can actually wear out if you write data to it too much. That can take years on modern devices, but it'd be a lot faster if a swap file was constantly writing to the storage!  What happens when a phone runs out of RAM then? Well, the app said it needed some memory to do something and there's no memory. So it can't do anything. If you think about it, it can't even show you an error message!

A *differential equation* is an equation, or a math statement, that tells you how fast something is changing, in terms of other things. A classic example is unrestrained bacterial cell division. Given sufficient space and resources, every bacteria cell can divide into 2 new cells each \u201ccycle\u201d (t). So if we have 2 cells, we gain +2 cells each cycle. If we have 10 cells, we gain +10 cells. In general, if we have *Y* cells, then we gain *Y* cells every cycle. In calculus speak:  > dY / dt = Y  where dY / dt means \u201chow fast Y is changing each cycle (t). This is also called a *derivative* or a *differential*, making this a *differential equation*.  What about a *Partial* differential equation?  The \u201cpartial\u201d means that there is more than 1 other variable that is going to affect things. In the above example, we only cared about how many bacteria would grow *per cycle*, or per unit of time. In calculus speak: we took the derivative of Y *with respect to* time (or \u201ccycle\u201d). What if the bacteria were growing along a wall, and bacteria at one end of the wall had more food and could grow faster than those at the other end of the wall? Now Y, the number of bacteria, depends not only on how much time has passed (t), but what position along the wall we are (x). So, we can take the *partial* derivative \u2202Y/\u2202t, but we *also* need to take the partial derivative \u2202Y/\u2202x to get the whole picture. ~~Note, these \u201cd\u201ds are usually lowercase Greek deltas when referring to partial derivatives.~~  Finally, *non-linear* refers to the exponents in the equation itself. \u201cLinear\u201d means variables are only raised to the first power and aren\u2019t multiplied together. Our first example was linear, because the right side of the equation only has Y raised to the first power. If the number of bacteria along this wall changes by the *square* of the number of bacteria for each incremental step along the wall, we have  > \u2202Y/\u2202x = Y^2  Which is a nonlinear partial differential equation.

      "question": "ELI5: what is a non-linear partial differential equation?",
      "answer": "Since I have no idea what your level of background knowledge is, I\u2019m going to just break down the whole phrase.  Let\u2019s start with *differential equation*.  \u201cDifferential\u201d is calculus-speak for \u201cchange\u201d, or \u201crate of change\u201d.  A *differential equation* is an equation, or a math statement, that tells you how fast something is changing, in terms of other things. A classic example is unrestrained bacterial cell division. Given sufficient space and resources, every bacteria cell can divide into 2 new cells each \u201ccycle\u201d (t). So if we have 2 cells, we gain +2 cells each cycle. If we have 10 cells, we gain +10 cells. In general, if we have *Y* cells, then we gain *Y* cells every cycle. In calculus speak:  > dY / dt = Y  where dY / dt means \u201chow fast Y is changing each cycle (t). This is also called a *derivative* or a *differential*, making this a *differential equation*.  What about a *Partial* differential equation?  The \u201cpartial\u201d means that there is more than 1 other variable that is going to affect things. In the above example, we only cared about how many bacteria would grow *per cycle*, or per unit of time. In calculus speak: we took the derivative of Y *with respect to* time (or \u201ccycle\u201d). What if the bacteria were growing along a wall, and bacteria at one end of the wall had more food and could grow faster than those at the other end of the wall? Now Y, the number of bacteria, depends not only on how much time has passed (t), but what position along the wall we are (x). So, we can take the *partial* derivative \u2202Y/\u2202t, but we *also* need to take the partial derivative \u2202Y/\u2202x to get the whole picture. ~~Note, these \u201cd\u201ds are usually lowercase Greek deltas when referring to partial derivatives.~~  Finally, *non-linear* refers to the exponents in the equation itself. \u201cLinear\u201d means variables are only raised to the first power and aren\u2019t multiplied together. Our first example was linear, because the right side of the equation only has Y raised to the first power. If the number of bacteria along this wall changes by the *square* of the number of bacteria for each incremental step along the wall, we have  > \u2202Y/\u2202x = Y^2  Which is a nonlinear partial differential equation.  EDIT: made some corrections based on comment below by u/angrious, including updating the partial derivative symbol to the correct one and changing the final equation to actually be non-linear.",

      "answer": "The effects of moisture on rocks very much depends on the type of rock. If it's porous like sandstone or limestone then it will become denser from absorbing it and possibly explode if exposed to high heat.  In regards to brittleness, water has very little to do with it as it's based on the strength of the bond between particles in the stone. If there's water soluble minerals then it can definitely weaken it, but those are very rare since water likely had already been through it (at least on earth)  There is a slight effect that water can have on rocks that break concoidally (aka like glass). Water filling any voids in the stone can allow cracks to propagate more easily. This trick is used by flint knappers to make some rocks easier to work with when making arrow heads/knives",
      "follow-up": "> In regards to brittleness, water has very little to do with it   I dunno, I think water often plays a significant role in how brittle rocks are or not. I get where you\u2019re coming from \u2014 the intrinsic factor is to do with atomic bonding in the minerals which make up the rock, and (if sedimentary) the particular medium which cemented it during lithification.   Certain other factors of the environment that the rock finds itself in are also important though. Most obvious would be the pressure and temperature conditions: higher temperatures encourage many deformation and/or transport mechanisms on the atomic scale as they are essentially all temperature dependent (things like Coble creep, grain boundary diffusion, Nabarro\u2013Herring creep, grain rotation etc) which are the ways that solid crystalline materials (like rock) can deform in a ductile manner without fracturing. Higher pressures help confine the rock in all directions, so it\u2019s less likely to rupture/fracture. So as you go deeper in the crust, you get increases in both temperature and pressure until you get about 15 km down and you\u2019re in the brittle-ductil transition zone. Much further and it will only be ductile deformation occurring, no fracturing at all.   The other important factor is water. You are right that water is not going to change the physical properties of the minerals themselves unless it\u2019s a water soluble mineral (and thus gets eroded) or one which can take up water into its crystalline structure. Now, although water does not enter the crystalline structure of other minerals (which is the vast majority of minerals), it generally generally reduces the brittle strength as a result of adsorption: water as a pore fluid decreases the surface energy, promotes crack growth and stress corrosion *without the rock having to reach the critical stress points.*  Having said all that, the exact result of more water being present as a pore fluid will depend on all the factors combined \u2014 what is the type of stress and the rate of stress being applied? What are the temperature and pressure conditions? What type of rock is it and what is its overall porosity and permeability? Is the pore space evenly distributed or very heterogeneous?

      "answer": "Big companies do do (hehe) their own accounting, the larger the size of the company, the bigger an accounting department to be found. But the companies have a lot of responsibility  when it comes to the stakeholders, so a way to validate the accounting. The big companies that dont do their own accounting is simply because its easier. Less effort for the same result, with less things to keep in mind.",

      "answer": "That is an ancient consumer marketing technique. A very long time ago, people in marketing figured out that consumers perceive a price of, say, $1.99 to be significantly less than a price of $2.00. Of course, those prices are not actually very different, but people tend to round down to the nearest significant digit rather than rounding up when they are purchasing consumer goods. The same is true for something like refrigerators: buyers will look at a fridge that costs $1199 and one that costs $1200, and they will express a preference for the slightly cheaper one regardless of any benefits the slightly more expensive one may possess. Psychologically, that $1 difference between 1199 and 1200 is very impactful. Now, let's change the prices of those refrigerators to, say, $1286 and $1288. Now people will look at the two refrigerators and perceive them both as being essentially the same price (which they are) because the significant digit  - 2 - is the same. For that very same reason, both refrigerators could increase in price to $1289, or even $1299, and nobody would even care. If the price creeps to $1300, the significant digit has changed and people start to think they're being hornswoggled.   The 9/10 thing is related to that behavior. Consumers ignore the 9/10 and focus on the pennies because that's the significant digit in a gasoline price. This effectively allows oil companies to charge an extra .9 cents per gallon of gas without you even realizing it.",

What we see is the brain\u2019s \u2018best guess\u2019 of what\u2019s out there. \\[...\\] In this view, which is often called \u2018predictive coding\u2019 or \u2018predictive processing\u2019, perception is a controlled hallucination, in which the brain\u2019s hypotheses are continually reined in by sensory signals arriving from the world and the body.\"   How do you know you almost hit your throat on the metal bar? I'm guessing that you know this based on sight. When given the sight of a metal bar as sensory input, the brain made a prediction: this is a hard metal object that will cause pain if it hits the body. Visual parts of the brain then sent a signal to predictive parts of the brain, which sent a signal to parts of the brain that feel pain. The feeling of pain was a prediction, and what you noticed was a prediction error. Prediction errors are usually surprising and easily catch attention. How exactly predictions are made about pain remains an area of active research ([source](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/843284v1.full)), but this is one idea. I don\u2019t know why this question got downvoted, since it\u2019s a really great question that gets into some deep neuroscience.  Edit: also, another example of predicted pain is the [rubber hand illusion](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sxwn1w7MJvk). If you use sensory input to trick the brain into perceiving a rubber hand as part of the body, suddenly hitting the rubber hand with a hammer will cause a feeling of pain as a prediction. One part of the brain involved is the [anterior cingulate cortex](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26518-x).",

The problem tends to be general in nature so you can't just test all alternatives  A famous example is Fermat's Last Theorem stated in 1637  It states that a\\^n +b\\^n = c\\^n do not have an integer solution for n >2  Finding a solution of n=1 is trivial because a number to the power of 1 is itself so 1^1+1^1=2^1 => 1+1=2  It is alos easy to find a solution for n=2    3^2+4^2=5^2 => 9+16=15  The problem is now how do you show that there is not a solution for n>2?  If you just test different options you can only show that there is not a solution for the one you have tested. You can test a lot of numbers on a computer but the number you have tested will always be limited.  If you like to test it for a b and n less than 1 billion you start to reach calculation time for a computer longer than the age of the universe. Even if you could do that calculation how do you know there is not a solution when some number are in the trillions?   There is an infinite number of integers so it is impossible to test all alternatives.  So to show the statement is true you need to discover a lot of maths and in 1995 ane 129 pages long proof was published by Andrew Wiles.

This is an analog system where the changing amplitude of our wave can be read as another wave - a wave that encodes the information we want.

Yes, absolutely.

A fever is *caused* by whatever \"bad\" stuff has gotten into you triggering your immune system to tell your brain to heat up your body. So, when all the bad stuff dies, your immune system stops telling your brain to heat up. This is what's happening when a fever \"breaks\" without medical intervention.",

A fever is *caused* by whatever \"bad\" stuff has gotten into you triggering your immune system to tell your brain to heat up your body. So, when all the bad stuff dies, your immune system stops telling your brain to heat up. This is what's happening when a fever \"breaks\" without medical intervention.",

First off, I think it\u2019s important to note that there are different types of deadlifting, but between conventional and sumo, deadlifts use %85 of muscles in your body when done correctly.   As already noted above, hips and knees drive the movement, and the load is shared throughout %85 the body (at different times throughout the movement). ~%45 of this should be your core, as it should be engaged the entire lift (many people don\u2019t realize this)!  The part of deadlifts being a compound leg exercise is predominantly the moment between picking up the bar from the ground, and performing the hip hinge. This exercises the hamstrings and quads immensely.   Isometric contractions moreso consist of squeezing your muscle area to \u201cactivate\u201d/warm up your muscle in an area. Ex. Weak glutes when squatting \u2014> isometrics for glutes before squatting.    Happy lifting!",

      "question": "ELI5: how did crocodiles survive the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs?",
      "answer": "Here's the current understanding of it:  When the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs hit, it smacked into the earth and ejected a bunch of rock, knocking a lot even up into space around earth.  This came falling back down all around the planet, and as it entered the atmosphere it started to heat up from re-entry, heating the air around it as well.  All over the planet, for hours, the sky above was red hot, glowing like an oven....and cooking anything on the surface of the earth...this would have caused massive wildfires as well.  Then, after this deadly pulse of heat, massive amounts of dust in the upper atmosphere would have blotted out the sun, cooling the earth and making it hard for plants to grow.  Only years later did the planet regain some sort of equilibrium, but by this time a mass extinction had wiped out many species and ecosystems were really out of whack.  So what does this have to do with crocodiles?  Well, if we look at patterns of extinction on land, what we see is that basically all the species that survived on land were smaller than about a kilogram...small enough to hide under something and avoid being baked to death during the first stage.    Crocs are much bigger than that, of course...but they live in streams.  _Stream_ life actually had an easier time than purely terrestrial animals.  Not just crocodiles, but turtles and amphibians too.  Why?  For one thing, when the sky turns boiling hot it helps to be able to dive under water.  And while food chains on land mostly depend on green and growing plants to survive,  food chains in streams often depend on detritus falling into streams...leaves fall into streams, bugs break down the leaves, fish eat the bugs, crocs eat the fish.  This means that during the aftermath of the impact, when nearly everything on land was dead or dying, freshwater ecosystems were better able to sort of limp along until things recovered, living on fallen plant matter, etc.  A lot of species still died...but they didn't _all_ die like all the (non avian) dinosaurs did.",

      "question": "ELI5: The BN (o) passport for HK was in the news this week. Can someone tell me what this is?",
      "answer": "I will preface this wall of text by saying that I am very much in favor of the 2019-2020 protests, so please read this text with that in mind.  British National (Overseas) was a scheme originally implemented in the 80s/90s. As the handover from the UK to the PRC of Hong Kong was being discussed, there was a concern that HKers born in a British colony/territory would be forcibly stripped of protections they had as nominal British subjects. To counteract that, the UK proposed that everyone born in HK prior to a certain date would be eligible to be a BN(O), or British National (Overseas). This would give them some consular protections as a British subject, but not full citizenship rights. The idea was to allow those who did not want to live under the PRC to emigrate as if they were British citizens. Many did, finding homes in other ex-British territories like Australia and Canada. However, the handover agreement promised 50 years of autonomy to the HK government from the PRC, which eased many people's minds about remaining in HK or returning to HK after the handover.  This is being revived now in light of the anti-government/pro-democracy protests that started in 2019. The crackdown by the pro-PRC HK government, culminating in the 2020 National Security Law (NSL) forced by the PRC onto HK, was not favorably received by the UK and other western nations, being seen as a violation of the handover agreement that the UK had signed with the PRC in 1984. The revival of BN(O) is supposed to be a recourse from the UK to HKers; since the PRC isn't allowing HKers the 50 years of autonomy that they owed them, the UK will again extend the offer to emigrate from HK with much loosened restrictions. I am not certain on the details, but the eligibility has been greatly expanded compared to the original BN(O) offer.  The PRC has counteracted by not recognizing these BN(O) documents as travel documents. This is a bit of a hollow move, as most (if not all) HK residents have HK/PRC travel documents.

      "answer": "I will preface this wall of text by saying that I am very much in favor of the 2019-2020 protests, so please read this text with that in mind.  British National (Overseas) was a scheme originally implemented in the 80s/90s. As the handover from the UK to the PRC of Hong Kong was being discussed, there was a concern that HKers born in a British colony/territory would be forcibly stripped of protections they had as nominal British subjects. To counteract that, the UK proposed that everyone born in HK prior to a certain date would be eligible to be a BN(O), or British National (Overseas). This would give them some consular protections as a British subject, but not full citizenship rights. The idea was to allow those who did not want to live under the PRC to emigrate as if they were British citizens. Many did, finding homes in other ex-British territories like Australia and Canada. However, the handover agreement promised 50 years of autonomy to the HK government from the PRC, which eased many people's minds about remaining in HK or returning to HK after the handover.  This is being revived now in light of the anti-government/pro-democracy protests that started in 2019. The crackdown by the pro-PRC HK government, culminating in the 2020 National Security Law (NSL) forced by the PRC onto HK, was not favorably received by the UK and other western nations, being seen as a violation of the handover agreement that the UK had signed with the PRC in 1984. The revival of BN(O) is supposed to be a recourse from the UK to HKers; since the PRC isn't allowing HKers the 50 years of autonomy that they owed them, the UK will again extend the offer to emigrate from HK with much loosened restrictions. I am not certain on the details, but the eligibility has been greatly expanded compared to the original BN(O) offer.  The PRC has counteracted by not recognizing these BN(O) documents as travel documents. This is a bit of a hollow move, as most (if not all) HK residents have HK/PRC travel documents. They would simply use HK documents to pass through emigration controls in HK when departing, then use their BN(O) documents to enter the other country.

      "answer": "We CAN.  Now, it's not very often in nature you come across pure hydrogen and pure oxygen.  But if you do have pure hydrogen and pure oxygen and you put them together in the right ratio, it's very easy to get them to form water.  In fact, it's hard to PREVENT them from forming water.  It's a common 9th grade science experiment, you run electricity through water in a certain way and one electrode has bubbles of pure oxygen forming on it and the other pure hydrogen.  You catch each in their own test-tube. You combine the two.   A very small spark will cause them to smoosh together and form water.  Thing is, sometimes you don't even need a spark, sometimes just the right (or wrong) type of shaking will do the trick.  Now, in the process of forming water a lot of heat is generated, which has the potential to be very damaging.  Also, pure oxygen tends to burn super easy so there's not a lot of pure oxygen around.  And pure hydrogen tends to react with stuff a lot too.  So you don't bump into pure forms of them very often in nature.

And making pure forms of them is relatively difficult and expensive.  **DUE TO REQUESTS - VIDEOS**  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38ULHoKWZag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38ULHoKWZag) \\- an animation of what is going on  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8gE4oZ9FQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8gE4oZ9FQ) \\- a guy using 2 thumbtacks and a 9 volt battery to do this - but he isn't catching the gas  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV8KbQyF228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV8KbQyF228) \\- a guy mixing O and H in front of a flame, it goes POP and they zoom in on the small droplets of water formed on the inside.

      "answer": "In a perfect vacuum, if you threw the ball up by tossing it up in the palm of your hand, it would keep moving forward with you and return to your  palm perfectly.  You can duplicate this effect in an evironment with an enclosed atmosphere, like a bus or a train or a car.  A motorcycle, however, does not have an enclosed atmosphere and cannot be ridden in a vacuum (internal combustion engines need oxygen).  So on a motorcycle, the ball will be hit by the molecules of the air, which is moving slower than the motorcycle, and it will slow down in the horizontal direction, and fall behind your hand.",

      "answer": "The same process still applies, many survivalists have it memorized and use it in the field. It's called the Universal Edibility Test. It's a several step process that takes most of the day to accomplish.  First, you seperate out the various parts. You need to test roots, leaves, stems, buds, and flowers independently, because sometimes one part will be poisonous while another isn't.   You give each bit a good smell. Strong and unpleasant odors are usually a bad sign, and if you're in the field you'll just generally discard them without further testing.   You test for contact poisoning by placing a tiny piece on your wrist for just a moment. If it burns, itches, numbs, or breaks into a rash, you just discard it.  Then you boil each bit individually. Test each piece by briefly touching it to your lips, and then waiting 15-30 minutes to see if anything happens. After that, you can take a small piece into your mouth, chew a couple of times, and hold it in your mouth for 15-30 minutes to see if anything happens. If it's bitter or soapy, you just discard it.  If there's no reaction at all, swallow it and wait the rest of the day. If there's no ill effect after several hours, you can assume this part of the plant is edible. Repeat the process for each individual part of the plant. Many plants have both edible and inedible parts to them, so this can take several days.     As far as fungi goes... just don't. If you're in the field and you can't determine the exact species of mushroom you're looking at with 100% accuracy, don't touch it, don't eat it, just leave it alone. There are many kinds of mushrooms that are edible in one circumstance, but poisonous in another. Hen mushrooms are safe, but if they're growing on a conifer or cedar tree, they're poisonous.  There are scientific tests you can do on mushrooms to determine their exact chemical components and identify if any of them are poisonous, or if they combine to create something poisonous, but if you're out in the woods it's a better idea to just leave them alone.",

It's a several step process that takes most of the day to accomplish.  First, you seperate out the various parts. You need to test roots, leaves, stems, buds, and flowers independently, because sometimes one part will be poisonous while another isn't.   You give each bit a good smell. Strong and unpleasant odors are usually a bad sign, and if you're in the field you'll just generally discard them without further testing.   You test for contact poisoning by placing a tiny piece on your wrist for just a moment. If it burns, itches, numbs, or breaks into a rash, you just discard it.  Then you boil each bit individually. Test each piece by briefly touching it to your lips, and then waiting 15-30 minutes to see if anything happens. After that, you can take a small piece into your mouth, chew a couple of times, and hold it in your mouth for 15-30 minutes to see if anything happens. If it's bitter or soapy, you just discard it.  If there's no reaction at all, swallow it and wait the rest of the day. If there's no ill effect after several hours, you can assume this part of the plant is edible. Repeat the process for each individual part of the plant. Many plants have both edible and inedible parts to them, so this can take several days.     As far as fungi goes... just don't. If you're in the field and you can't determine the exact species of mushroom you're looking at with 100% accuracy, don't touch it, don't eat it, just leave it alone. There are many kinds of mushrooms that are edible in one circumstance, but poisonous in another. Hen mushrooms are safe, but if they're growing on a conifer or cedar tree, they're poisonous.  There are scientific tests you can do on mushrooms to determine their exact chemical components and identify if any of them are poisonous, or if they combine to create something poisonous, but if you're out in the woods it's a better idea to just leave them alone.",
      "follow-up": "Thank you for the detailed response. I have heard about a similar manual, systematic approach determining edibility in the past. Is there anything else to test on a molecular basis to determine if it will effect the various cells in the human body?",

      "answer": "Anthropologists believe they were basically the same as modern humans, provided they were *Homo sapiens sapiens*. They buried their dead, they made art. They enjoyed sex. They had fun with their kids. They were as smart as people today.   There may have been slight facial differences with modern humans but there are a wide range of face shapes with modern humans and they would fit into that range. So like you might see one and while you might not be able to identify them as looking like people of a given ethnicity, you wouldn\u2019t think that no human would look that way. Early modern humans in Europe were dark skinned but blue eyes came along earlier than skin color became the very pale color that exists now, so you might see a blue eyed person with darker skin, an unusual combination today.   One change in the past 10,000 years is teeth. Ancient humans had an edge-to-edge bite. Front teeth, top and bottom, met at the edge. Nowadays almost everyone has the front upper teeth be in front of the lower front teeth, overlapping a bit. But ancient modern humans would use front teeth to bite down on meat and tear pieces off, pulling the incisors into alignment. They also had perfect teeth for the most part, with more muscular jaws, and that would affect their appearance. They wouldn\u2019t have most of the diseases of modern life such as nearsightedness, tooth decay, acne, etc. they lived in small groups so many of the diseases of high density living didn\u2019t exist or seldom happened, like measles, smallpox, sexually transmitted infections, maybe colds and flu.   Archaic Homo sapiens, meaning people pretty far back on that timeline you give, like 100,000-200,000 years ago, might have had more differences in appearance\u2014they\u2019d be more robust, bigger muscles, thicker brow ridges, less prominent chin.   Women\u2019s bodies would be quite different in the sense that they might only ovulate and have periods fairly seldom because they\u2019d be pregnant a lot and under the conditions they lived in, they would nurse for several years and not be fertile or have a period for most of that time.",

      "answer": "First of all, the light does not reach your muscles, it just reaches your skin. So it cannot have any direct effect on the muscles anyway.  But more importantly, muscles cannot just convert any sort of energy into movement, just like a diesel engine can only use diesel and not steam or wind or electricity. The energy source for muscles is a specific chemical \"fuel\" in your body called ATP, muscles can only use that and nothing else.  However, while the ATP is the energy source, your brain has to control the muscles somehow, and it does that - simplifying here - by sending electric impulses along your nerves. If you touch an electric cable, the electricity will cause havoc with this communications system - your muscles believe that they're given random, frantic orders, and act accordingly.  So, in short - muscle spasm don't happen because of too much energy, but because they recieve random orders.",

So if you drop in a book or a stone of the same weight the state of the black hole just increases by that mass and it's impossible to find out what dropped in.  There are many suggested solutions to solve this paradox. For example the black hole might release that information in hawking radiation over a very long timespan",

The Atari 520 ST was famous for having socketed chips that would work their way up and out of the socket due to cycles of expansion caused by heating and cooling, eventually causing the machine to \"fail\".      A solution - not a great one - but a solution that often worked, was to hold the entire machine about 11-18\" above the desk surface and drop it.

      "question": "ELI5: Why is it impossible to suck through a straw that's 10.4 meters long?",
      "answer": "The action of sucking does not actually pull on water. Rather, it allows the air on the other end to push by removing the air from the end inside of your mouth.  This means that, since there is only 1 atm of air, you're limited to that much pushing.  As water climbs the tube, gravity pulls it down, generating a pressure to counteract the pushing. This pressure depends solely on the density of water and the height at the top of the water.  So, solving for the density of water, we see that water can only get 10.4 meters above its surface from the action of atmospheric pressure. If the straw goes deeper than the water's surface, then the straw itself can be longer, but the water can only be raised above its surface by that amount.

      "question": "ELI5: Why is it impossible to suck through a straw that's 10.4 meters long?",
      "answer": "The action of sucking does not actually pull on water. Rather, it allows the air on the other end to push by removing the air from the end inside of your mouth.  This means that, since there is only 1 atm of air, you're limited to that much pushing.  As water climbs the tube, gravity pulls it down, generating a pressure to counteract the pushing. This pressure depends solely on the density of water and the height at the top of the water.  So, solving for the density of water, we see that water can only get 10.4 meters above its surface from the action of atmospheric pressure. If the straw goes deeper than the water's surface, then the straw itself can be longer, but the water can only be raised above its surface by that amount.  The formula for hydrostatic pressure is quite straightforward. p = \u03c1 g h  This is the pressure generated by gravity acting on the water, and it is the pressure that counteracts the pressure of air pushing up.

You can also have reactions with other elements (e.g. chlorine, flourine) that are exothermic. Finally beyond traditional chemical reactions, nuclear fission or fusion is obviously exothermic, but do not require oxygen.",

Gaseous oxygen does tend to stick to other oxygen to form O2 but that isn't really considered burning.  But even when oxygen bonds to a fuel it is still oxygen.

      "question": "ELI5: What is human flatulence?",
      "answer": "Not a gastroenterologist, but let's examine the premise and start with some facts in the hopes of getting some serious answers. I think the point of your question lies in fart-transmission being different from fecal transmission. We know well that we can get sick from bacteria/viruses going from poop to another persons mouth and infecting them that way. You're suggesting an airborne transmission of an intestinal illness (I think).  1. The average amount of gas a human produces in a day is roughly 1L (per Google) 2. The average amount of air exhaled in a day is roughly 11,000L.  So from this we know that if a microorganism had to choose spreading via farting which is to say by airborne transmission, that's 11,000 times *less efficient* than just going straight through the lungs. We also know that microorganisms generally infect/attack the place they are released from, so an intestinal infection prefers to attack the intestine which means it needs to be eaten, not inhaled. *It is possible* to get intestinal infections in your lungs and lung infections in your intestines in certain cases but this isn't common, it's not the preferred method of transmission.  We can also assume that most farts are filtered through underwear and pants, which is similar to wearing a face mask, it'll filter out many of the particulates that microorganisms ride on. So let's assume transmission from fart, through clothes, into the lungs is yet further unlikely.  In the end, this doesn't pass the sniff test (...ha), it's just too circuitous to be an intentional transmission route. Much easier for the illness to spread via direct fecal contamination, in fact that's really, really easy.  However, a quick google search gives an affirmative \"Not Completely Impossible\" as there are demonstrated cases of Cholera (an intestinal illness) infecting the lungs of people with immune disorders. In this case, it's most likely a case of dirty-surface fecal contamination being introduced to the lungs via touching the nose/mouth and *inhaling the feces* but still, it's credible.  So \"Not Fully Impossible\" but extremely unlikely unless you have extremely poor hygiene habits and are immunocompromised.",

I guess what I've quoted above is one of the things I was curious about. The distinction between flatulence and feces. Can we draw a pretty stable line in the sand between the two, in most cases? Outside of some sort of serious sickness, where flatulence possibly leads to feces (sorry for gross visual), the two are basically in separate bacterial categories as far as I understand (please correct me if I'm wrong).  I know from reading random Reddit threads that many, many people like to sleep in their beds without any clothes.

      "question": "ELI5: What is human flatulence?",
      "answer": "Not a gastroenterologist, but let's examine the premise and start with some facts in the hopes of getting some serious answers. I think the point of your question lies in fart-transmission being different from fecal transmission. We know well that we can get sick from bacteria/viruses going from poop to another persons mouth and infecting them that way. You're suggesting an airborne transmission of an intestinal illness (I think).  1. The average amount of gas a human produces in a day is roughly 1L (per Google) 2. The average amount of air exhaled in a day is roughly 11,000L.  So from this we know that if a microorganism had to choose spreading via farting which is to say by airborne transmission, that's 11,000 times *less efficient* than just going straight through the lungs. We also know that microorganisms generally infect/attack the place they are released from, so an intestinal infection prefers to attack the intestine which means it needs to be eaten, not inhaled. *It is possible* to get intestinal infections in your lungs and lung infections in your intestines in certain cases but this isn't common, it's not the preferred method of transmission.  We can also assume that most farts are filtered through underwear and pants, which is similar to wearing a face mask, it'll filter out many of the particulates that microorganisms ride on. So let's assume transmission from fart, through clothes, into the lungs is yet further unlikely.  In the end, this doesn't pass the sniff test (...ha), it's just too circuitous to be an intentional transmission route. Much easier for the illness to spread via direct fecal contamination, in fact that's really, really easy.  However, a quick google search gives an affirmative \"Not Completely Impossible\" as there are demonstrated cases of Cholera (an intestinal illness) infecting the lungs of people with immune disorders. In this case, it's most likely a case of dirty-surface fecal contamination being introduced to the lungs via touching the nose/mouth and *inhaling the feces* but still, it's credible.  So \"Not Fully Impossible\" but extremely unlikely unless you have extremely poor hygiene habits and are immunocompromised.",
      "follow-up": "> In the end, this doesn't pass the sniff test (...ha), it's just too circuitous to be an intentional transmission route. Much easier for the illness to spread via direct fecal contamination, in fact that's really, really easy.  Thanks for taking the question seriously!  I guess what I've quoted above is one of the things I was curious about. The distinction between flatulence and feces. Can we draw a pretty stable line in the sand between the two, in most cases? Outside of some sort of serious sickness, where flatulence possibly leads to feces (sorry for gross visual), the two are basically in separate bacterial categories as far as I understand (please correct me if I'm wrong).  I know from reading random Reddit threads that many, many people like to sleep in their beds without any clothes. I've always found that idea sort of baffling for hygienic reasons, but then I started to wonder if my confusion/repulsion had any basis in fact. This is sort of the idiosyncratic origin story behind this thread's random question, I guess.  So I started to wonder...if those people are passing gas in bed while sleeping in the nude, are they rolling around in harmful bacteria? If they share their bed with someone else, or if someone else sleeps in that bed later on, would they also be rolling around in harmful bacteria? Would there be a risk of infection? Pink eye at the very least?",

      "question": "ELI5: Can singularities be ever formed from an outsiders perspective?",
      "answer": "A quick note on terminology; the \"singularity\" is the theoretical point right in the centre of a massive object where its density and gravitational field are infinite under current best models. They may exist, or the models may be not quite right (e.g. quantum mechanics may get in the way). Black holes may have singularities at their centre. But black holes don't \"need\" singularities, they are defined by their event horizons.  The \"event horizon\" is the region around a black hole (technically a 2d surface) that makes a black hole special; it is the point where all worldlines (so future paths in spacetime - where things *could* go) of objects in that region end up falling down towards the massive object in the middle (see [this neat set of diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BH-no-escape-1.svg)). In the simple model for a black hole, the event horizon is a distance of 2GM/c^2 from the singularity (where G is the gravitational constant, M the total mass inside the event horizon and c the 'speed of light').  A black hole forms when there is enough mass within a small enough volume so that this distance (2GM/c^(2)) is outside the object. All that mass doesn't have to be concentrated at the singularity, it just has to be within the event horizon distance of it.  At the event horizon, from the perspective of an observer an infinite distance away, time dilation would be infinite. So when observing something fall into a black hole, you can never see the object cross the event horizon, it will just slow down and stop (and you can obviously never see it cross, as the light of it crossing can never reach you).  But locally everything looks normal. From the perspective of an object falling into the black hole, it doesn't notice the event horizon (although they'll be a lot of other stuff going on there - it won't be a friendly place to hang out), it just keeps falling. [This graphic shows this fairly well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gravitational_time_dilation_around_a_black_hole.gif) - on the left you have what things look like from the object's perspective as it falls in. On the right you have the outside observer's view. From the object's point of view, it just falls in as normal.  Of course, *this only applies once the black hole has formed*, so once the event horizon exists. Before then, the time dilation in that region, while significant, wouldn't be infinite. So there would still be time for things to fall in.  Disclaimer; I haven't done the maths (GR maths is notoriously difficult), but I suspect that yes, if you were an infinite distance away, it would take an infinite amount of time for a black hole to form. But if you are an infinite distance away none of that matters - you are too far away. If you are any closer (i.e. a finite distance away), it would take less than an infinite amount of time to form - and so it is possible.  And we know this is possible; black holes exist.",

So you need to make sure that your income is very close to the money you spend in a given year.  The second trick is to only transfer wealth to income where the tax rates are most convenient to do so. When you have vastly more wealth than you need, you can \"plan\" when you take out certain amounts of money.  (e.g. long term investments are generally taxed lower than short term. So if you can \"plan\" to keep your money invested for years, you pay less tax when you sell them compared to buying and selling in the same year)  The third trick is to use shell companies to circumvent individual ownership. Wealth and income are taxed differently for companies than it is for individuals. aka jeff Bezos doesn't own a yacht. Jeff Bezos started a company, took out a loan at a bank (using his Amazon shares as collateral) and then the company buys the yacht. He then \"leases\" or \"rents\" the yacht from his own company.  This accomplishes a few things:  * He doesn't have to pay income taxes on the money used to buy the yacht. * He doesn't directly own the yacht, therefore it's not counted towards his net wealth. (and thus cannot be taxed) * The company has a whole bunch of tax write offs because it barely turns a profit.    * (in simple terms, the trick is to lease the yacht for just more than it costs the company to own/operate it)  \\*EDIT\\*  lease note that this is grossly simplified. It's irrelevant to know all the loopholes yourself. The last trick is to have so much money that you can hire a bunch of family accountants that research and do this for you. You just say \"i want a yacht\" and they will figure out the best way to do it for you.  \\*EDIT 2\\*  The final trick is to hire the lawyers and accountants that created, or create, the rules.

A coincidence of resources, circumstances, and/or sexual selection tendencies that shaped our evolution. i.e. Instincts helped some species survive.  Humans depend on their instincts less presumably because our other non-instinctive tendencies are more effective at causing successful reproduction and survival to reproductive age.  Neurologists argue that mutations in the human brain structure caused larger distances between the more primitive parts of our brain and memory storing areas. This distance that neural impulses need to travel still had to fit in a small skull which caused some cross-over signals to occur. Erroneous associations between things like recalling a memory of a tiger being dangerous and painful and that sharp rock you sat on to be similarly painful may constitute what we call \"creativity\" and enable ideas like using sharp rocks to defend from sharp tigers. This kind of association was not due to logical discourse but an accidental and irrational association of two mildly similar things due to neurons firing incorrectly. This erroneous processing that gave rise to creativity was selected for over and over due to its apparent value in creative problem solving.  So, it might be argued that creative problem solving has been a more effective means of survival, reproduction, and/or survival of young to reproductive age.

      "answer": "Major Central Banks (and the Exchequer) are pumping money into their economies through quantitative easing (QE). This is the Central Bank buying back government bonds from banks and therefore putting cash into the accounts of the banks. And this cash is not earning much when redeposited with the CB or when lent to other banks (near zero and sometimes negative rates).   Banks are therefore literally sitting on funds that they are not earning any money from if they cannot lend it to others. This explains their willingness to lend at very low rates. These loans (it is hoped) goes into productive investment and therefore helps push up economic activity through wage increases and consumption. Unfortunately, this cash also goes into asset purchases like property and the stock market which isn't exactly ideal (rising property prices and share prices leading to asset price \"bubbles\") Ultimately this kind of expansionary policy tends to lead to higher inflation which is what many people are fearing is happening now.   Until the Central Banks dial back this policy either by slowing down (tapering off) QE or by increasing interest rates, this might continue. The problem here is that while tapering and increasing interest dials down inflation pressure (the intended effect) it also risks a large fall in asset prices (housing and stock markets). The problem with rapidly falling asset prices is that this can lead to enormous pressure on banks to dial back quickly on loans (fearing loan defaults) and this becomes a multiplying effect on slowing down the economy (since a lot of economic activity relies on bank credit. This can lead to a condition called stagflation - where prices increase AND economic activity decreases, essentially the worst of both worlds.   Long story short, it is very possible that the Central Banks are willing to accept (hopefully temporary) higher inflation while trying to avoid massive and sudden asset price deflation.

      "question": "ELI5 UK: how are mortgage rates so low?",
      "answer": "Major Central Banks (and the Exchequer) are pumping money into their economies through quantitative easing (QE). This is the Central Bank buying back government bonds from banks and therefore putting cash into the accounts of the banks. And this cash is not earning much when redeposited with the CB or when lent to other banks (near zero and sometimes negative rates).   Banks are therefore literally sitting on funds that they are not earning any money from if they cannot lend it to others. This explains their willingness to lend at very low rates. These loans (it is hoped) goes into productive investment and therefore helps push up economic activity through wage increases and consumption. Unfortunately, this cash also goes into asset purchases like property and the stock market which isn't exactly ideal (rising property prices and share prices leading to asset price \"bubbles\") Ultimately this kind of expansionary policy tends to lead to higher inflation which is what many people are fearing is happening now.   Until the Central Banks dial back this policy either by slowing down (tapering off) QE or by increasing interest rates, this might continue. The problem here is that while tapering and increasing interest dials down inflation pressure (the intended effect) it also risks a large fall in asset prices (housing and stock markets). The problem with rapidly falling asset prices is that this can lead to enormous pressure on banks to dial back quickly on loans (fearing loan defaults) and this becomes a multiplying effect on slowing down the economy (since a lot of economic activity relies on bank credit. This can lead to a condition called stagflation - where prices increase AND economic activity decreases, essentially the worst of both worlds.   Long story short, it is very possible that the Central Banks are willing to accept (hopefully temporary) higher inflation while trying to avoid massive and sudden asset price deflation. This is a very delicate path to take.",
      "follow-up": "Thanks for that clear explanation!  Can Central Banks adjust their deposit rates based on a bank\u2019s loan portfolio?  For instance, if bank A has a portfolio heavy with greenfield investment, then they receive a proportionately better deposit rate compared to bank B which has a loan portfolio with greater exposure to, say, investors who are just churning existing housing property.",

      "question": "ELI5: If the sun is basically a giant nuclear reactor, why can't it make the higher elements like iron?",
      "answer": "Iron is the limit because that's the point at which fusion stops producing energy. Beyond Iron-56, fusion consumes energy, rather than producing it. Stars do, at the end of their life, produce heavier elements - but that production actually robs them of the energy needed to hold their massive gravity up. So when that happens, a star is at the point of imminent collapse.  The Sun, specifically, does not make iron because its core is not hot and dense enough. The Sun is currently only hot enough to produce helium from hydrogen. Late in its life, the Sun will partially collapse until its core heats up enough to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen, but the Sun is not large enough to go any further than that.  > Also wouldn't stars make better nuclear reactors than our own nuclear reactors and particle accelerators? So why can't they also make elements with really high atomic numbers, like Oganesson and Fermium?  During their final moments - and in particular during the collisions of neutron stars - they *do* produce very heavy elements (although I don't think it's known whether they produce all the way to 118 or beyond). During the [r-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process), stars run up the line of nuclei that can juuuuust barely take another neutron. These nuclei are already phenomenally unstable and may include some we can't produce here on Earth yet because we have no mechanism to bombard them with neutrons that fast. But they decay almost immediately.",

Low impedance at low frequencies, and high impedance at high frequencies. And impedance basically means frequency dependent resistance. So, one thing you can do is use a capacitor to drive high frequencies into the ground, and inductor to do the same for low frequencies. Boom, that's a band-pass filter. That's pretty useful for radio applications, since you probably don't want to be listening all the frequencies at the same time.  Now for radios, a tuning capacitor is certainly used to control the internal mixing frequency, but that works just the same for incoming and outgoing signals.

      "follow-up": ">how do those electrical signals convert back to a sound  Magnets. Seriously, it's just magnets.  When your voice hits the microphone on your phone, it vibrates a magnet back and forth, and the vibrating magnet ripples the electrons in the phone line.  When the ripples (which travel almost at the speed of light) reach the person on the other end, they go into another magnet. When a magnet connected to wires is vibrated, it ripples the electrons \u2014 and when the rippling electrons touch the magnet on the other side, it vibrates the magnet! It's literally the inverse of how it went in. Yeah, that's right, a speaker is fundamentally *the same exact thing* as a microphone, just built differently to better suit the task.  So, when the magnet in the speaker on your friend's phone vibrates, it moves the air around it, because all moving objects contain momentum that transfers to the molecules around it. And these air movements are sound \u2014 your voice, to be exact.  >that mimics a persons pitch or tone of voice so precisely?  Now, to address this part. If you move the magnet back and forth very quickly at 256 Hz (256 back-and-forths per second) the person on the other end hears a pure C note. Just one note.  Your voice is a complex superposition of a shitton of different pure fundamental frequencies. In other words, your voice is multiple pure notes played at the same time. When you say \"hey dude,\" your vocal cords are producing many individual pure notes that add up to form a much more complex sound. *All* sounds can be broken up into constituent pure notes. This is the concept of the Fourier transform, but you don't need to worry about that.  How do all those notes fit into the phone line at the same time? Well, they just sorta... do. Electrons are *tiny.* Go look up the size of an electron \u2014 yeah, they're really freaking small. Tons of them can fit on a very small wire at the same time. So, each of the sound waves that add up to your voice are simply carried along the wire simultaneously. Imagine if cars were like ghosts, and they could just pass through each other while driving to their destination. That's what electrons are like. It isn't really this simple in reality because of quantum physics, and I'm not qualified to explain that, but for 99% of cases, it just works like that.  And all those constituent waves travel the exact same way as the single pure note dud. The only reason the clarity goes down at all is because some of the electrons bump into shit. As technology gets better, we find ways to keep the electrons from bumping into shit, and we improve the clarity of our phones.  I hope that answers your question, and I'm happy to keep explaining if it doesn't.",

      "question": "ELI5: How are voice calls across the world instant and how do they work? How can sound travel millions of times faster than the speed of sound?",
      "answer": "Just to jump on this, I understand that sound is converted to electrical signals, but how do those electrical signals convert back to a sound that mimics a persons pitch or tone of voice so precisely?",
      "follow-up": ">how do those electrical signals convert back to a sound  Magnets. Seriously, it's just magnets.  When your voice hits the microphone on your phone, it vibrates a magnet back and forth, and the vibrating magnet ripples the electrons in the phone line.  When the ripples (which travel almost at the speed of light) reach the person on the other end, they go into another magnet. When a magnet connected to wires is vibrated, it ripples the electrons \u2014 and when the rippling electrons touch the magnet on the other side, it vibrates the magnet! It's literally the inverse of how it went in. Yeah, that's right, a speaker is fundamentally *the same exact thing* as a microphone, just built differently to better suit the task.  So, when the magnet in the speaker on your friend's phone vibrates, it moves the air around it, because all moving objects contain momentum that transfers to the molecules around it. And these air movements are sound \u2014 your voice, to be exact.  >that mimics a persons pitch or tone of voice so precisely?  Now, to address this part. If you move the magnet back and forth very quickly at 256 Hz (256 back-and-forths per second) the person on the other end hears a pure C note. Just one note.  Your voice is a complex superposition of a shitton of different pure fundamental frequencies. In other words, your voice is multiple pure notes played at the same time. When you say \"hey dude,\" your vocal cords are producing many individual pure notes that add up to form a much more complex sound. *All* sounds can be broken up into constituent pure notes. This is the concept of the Fourier transform, but you don't need to worry about that.  How do all those notes fit into the phone line at the same time? Well, they just sorta... do. Electrons are *tiny.* Go look up the size of an electron \u2014 yeah, they're really freaking small. Tons of them can fit on a very small wire at the same time. So, each of the sound waves that add up to your voice are simply carried along the wire simultaneously. Imagine if cars were like ghosts, and they could just pass through each other while driving to their destination. That's what electrons are like. It isn't really this simple in reality because of quantum physics, and I'm not qualified to explain that, but for 99% of cases, it just works like that.  And all those constituent waves travel the exact same way as the single pure note dud. The only reason the clarity goes down at all is because some of the electrons bump into shit. As technology gets better, we find ways to keep the electrons from bumping into shit, and we improve the clarity of our phones.  I hope that answers your question, and I'm happy to keep explaining if it doesn't.",

      "answer": "An embryo with one or more extra chromosomes doesn't just get entirely new ones with genes that the average person doesn't have. Rather, one of the chromosomes that we all have a pair of gets an extra copy, so the embryo has three instead of the regular two.   For most chromosomes, if you have three instead of two, it doesn't lead to viable embryo. The child will die either in the uterus, or at a young age. For some chromosomes, the \"damage\" is less severe, and the child will survive, but may have health problems, including often a reduced life expectancy. Down syndrome, for instance, is caused by a *trisomy* (three chromosome copies) of the 21st chromosome (we all have 23 chromosome pairs that scientists have labeled with numbers 1-23).  Down syndrome is always caused by trisomy of the 21st chromosome, but there are other trisomies that are compatible with life and lead to different symptoms, such as trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). The latter is more severe and often results in miscarriage too, but some fetuses do survive.   For sex chromosomes, i.e. X and Y, typical females have a pair, XX, while typical males have two different copies, XY. You can have trisomy of these sex chromosomes too, leading to combinations like XXX, XXY or XYY. These trisomies are often more benign and not always associated with (noticeable) symptoms, to the point where people may live their lives not knowing they have three sex chromosomes until it happens to come up in a genetic test.",

      "answer": "Intense heat or intense cold can shock mold spores to sprout mycelium. After Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the cities turned pink with aspergillus from the spores that were heat shocked by the firestorm and blast (and yes, some spores did survive the atomic blast). Taking room temp food covered with spores (think strawberries) and putting them in the fridge cold shocks the spores in to action too. The spores are everywhere ALL THE TIME.  And they don't like water. Aspergillus spores are football shaped and when water spalshes on them, they get spread all over by flying through the air end over end. I did genetic work on fungi in college and I watched this happen under the microscope (a dissecting stereoscope actually). It's very cool. In order to control where we put the spores, we used buffer solutions with a teeny amount of surfactant in them, a surfactant is soap.  The soap makes the spores stay suspended in the water.

      "answer": "It's not a terrible question, but you have to understand that it's really hard to get things out of earth's gravity.  Imagine lifting a garbage truck into space.   Space is only about 100 km away, but lifting things this far takes a huge amount of energy.  The equation for how much energy is simple, just mass (in grams) times the gravitational acceleration (10 m/s^(2)) times height in meters.  So if you want to lift a ton of garbage to space, you're looking at 1,000,000 g x 10 m/s^(2) x 100,000 meters = 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion) Joules of energy.  If we translate that into food, that becomes 239,000,000 kilocalories (same as dietary calories)  Basically this is the amount of energy used by about 120,000 humans in a day.  Or, put another way, 1 trillion joules is the amount of energy stored in 70 million aa batteries.  Now this is a simplification to get across the immense amounts of energy needed to get anything to space.  The actual energy requirements to get to the sun are much higher than this.",

      "question": "Eli5 how do conjoined twins operate their bodies?",
      "answer": "Who controls what varies hugely between individuals, because body and brain structure is unique. The connections made by the two brains during fetal development to different body parts and functions is random. So in some sets of twins, one twin may control one arm and leg, and the other controls the others. In another set, one twin may only control one arm or leg. In some cases one twin may have full function of everything and the other twin can\u2019t control anything.    In situations were both twins each control half the body, They must coordinate to be able to perform tasks like walking efficiently. Because they are like this right out of the womb, it\u2019s normal for them and they learn how to coordinate movements during infancy, just as a person with a regular body would learn to walk.",
      "follow-up": "I presume it wouldn\u2019t be possible that they both have control of all parts? So that they could both lift the left arm, just not at the same time.   I would think that would be impossible because that would mean that if one wants to move it up, and the other wants to lower it. It wouldn\u2019t know what to do",

      "answer": "Because all of the food now is riddled with terrible ingredients we have not evolved to eat naturally so some corporations can take in large profits. Long before there were drug cartels there were sugar cartels. The main reason why we have high fructose corn syrup is because the government decided that they wanted to prop up corn Farmers with subsidies and whenever corn products were no longer selling as much they had to come up with new ways and invent products where corn could be refined into other products such a sweeteners. The Western diet is over processed in nature due to the fact that it is cheaper than sourcing nutritious ingredients.

To do this it necessarily has to already have assumptions about what colors make sense, to use as a reference. It's very easy to trick this computation by putting your eyes in an unusual context, like [rapidly changing background colors](https://us-browse.startpage.com/av/anon-image?piurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net%2FwNcRvG84RnMWkTAPM5twrR-1200-80.jpg&sp=1644301314T9b2a873cc17a67c83029d81aaf61d55dc4f04cc679256a6144fe75fa002fccaa).",

So to make sure I understand... my \"green\" cones can detect every color, just in the same way I can see every color, even that I may have green sunglasses on (yes it is properly more the complimentary color, but just for fun) and the same with blue and red.  Things are just easier to see / clear if the color is more in the same color as the cone's \"color\"?",

      "question": "ELI5: How does the government owe itself money?",
      "answer": "The treasury sold IOUs to various departments within the federal government, mostly Social Security (and the Federal Reserve, but they\u2019re not exactly considered part of the government). The federal government is required to eventually pay that money back to those departments, so they owe them, which means they owe themselves.   The problem is that interest has to be paid on those IOUs, and the only ways to pay that interest are to either raise taxes or borrow more money. The more politically expedient thing to do is borrow money, and even a 5 year old can understand what kind of slippery slope that is.",
      "follow-up": "> The problem is that interest has to be paid on those IOUs, and the only ways to pay that interest are to either raise taxes or borrow more money.  US treasury bonds tend to be at or below inflation rates. Which means the US government technically makes money off of debt. This is something few other countries and no business or individual can claim. So no, in the US government's case that's not a slippery slope. Not to mention that government debt IS the money supply. If the US government paid off all its debt it would crash the economy. Should we reign in spending? Yes. But not because it's the \"right\" thing to do. But because it gives the government more breathing room to take action during the next economic crisis.  Government finance is nothing like business finance which is also nothing like personal finance. Most people barely even understand personal finance.",

This isn't something we are likely to be able to breed into humanity because breeding is really only useful to increase the prevalence of existing traits; if you want taller people you breed the tallest current people together and their offspring are likely to be taller.

If you run a direct wire between the live and ground prongs of your outlet, there is little to impede their flow and you get a flood of electrons - breakers in your house shut off power when this happens.

One of the most basic equations you'll find in electronics is V=IR, which describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.  Other devices may use inductive or capacitive limits - AC power is constantly trying to change, and these components can limit it by either requiring or resisting change - unlike a resistor these do not turn energy into heat and so are more efficient.  More modern supplies switch on and off. By switching on and off faster or slower, we can limit how much power flows through without bulky capacitors or inductors and without the waste of resistors.

      "question": "ELI5: how do videogame engines affect the quality of the graphics?",
      "answer": "The definition of a game engine is essentially: what you have left over if you take the game out of the game. It's all the behind-the-scenes stuff that makes everything work. You look at the screen and see a picture of a dragon - that's the game. Somebody had to draw a dragon and put that in the game. What about the code that turns the drawing into 3D pixels? That's the engine.   So the engine is actually the majority of the code in the \"game\". It's not surprising it affects almost everything.   Yes, every engine has its upper limits. Something like the original Doom, for example, was designed to run on a DOS computer in 1994 or whatever, and it takes a lot of shortcuts for speed, and has a lot of limitations to make those shortcuts work. You can't look up or down in the original Doom. And the monsters aren't even 3D. Those are the limitations people accepted in exchange for getting it to work at all.  Sometimes there are fundamental design tradeoffs. For example, Factorio has a multiplayer mode. There's a lot of stuff happening in a Factorio game and it would be laggy if the server had to keep telling every player what was happening around them. So what it actually does is each player's computer runs the entire game and they stay synced up. But this means you can't have anything in the game that's random, because they'd get out of sync. Even things that seem random aren't actually random. It also means every player's computer needs to download a copy of the entire game world, when they log in. And it means if anyone's computer is too slow to run the game at normal speed, everyone gets slowed down, or that person gets kicked out.  So you can either have multiplayer that isn't laggy, **or** people with slow computers can play multiplayer, but not both. And changing from one to the other means rewriting the whole multiplayer part of the game from scratch. If you show someone a game that's designed to avoid the lag and ask how slow computers can play multiplayer without slowing everything down, the answer is they can't. It's not that it's impossible; it's just impossible *in that engine design with the fast multiplayer*. If you changed it it wouldn't be the same multiplayer engine any more. Hope this helps.",

So what it actually does is each player's computer runs the entire game and they stay synced up. But this means you can't have anything in the game that's random, because they'd get out of sync. Even things that seem random aren't actually random. It also means every player's computer needs to download a copy of the entire game world, when they log in. And it means if anyone's computer is too slow to run the game at normal speed, everyone gets slowed down, or that person gets kicked out.  So you can either have multiplayer that isn't laggy, **or** people with slow computers can play multiplayer, but not both. And changing from one to the other means rewriting the whole multiplayer part of the game from scratch. If you show someone a game that's designed to avoid the lag and ask how slow computers can play multiplayer without slowing everything down, the answer is they can't. It's not that it's impossible; it's just impossible *in that engine design with the fast multiplayer*. If you changed it it wouldn't be the same multiplayer engine any more. Hope this helps.",

      "answer": "force of gravity between two bodies is dependent on both the masses, not just one of them.  newton's gravitational force equation is F= GMm/r^2 where G is the universal gravitational constant, M is the mass of one body, m is the mass of the other body and r is the distance between the centers of the two bodies when the centers are joined by a straight line.  hope that helps!",

      "answer": "So we have a fairly good understanding of how stars work; we can discern quite a bit about them from their size and color and luminosity.  So now pass a planet in front of that light, and the light will change. Not only will it dim, because it's partially obscured, but the spectral lines will change. From how they change, we can deduce the chemistry of the object that passed in front of it. We can, for example, tell that the object is gaseous, or has an atmosphere, or is rocky, and some of its basic chemical makeup. We can deduce more from other clues, like the period of the orbit, so it's orbital distance, its gravity, other things.  A lot of the conclusions, like it rains diamonds, come from deduction. We understand pretty well how chemistry and physics work, so on some given planet, we know IT MUST rain nano diamonds, our understanding of physics tells us so, it's predictive, and it tends to be pretty accurate.",

So we can infer that it has a rocky atmosphere because that is what we observe in the X-rays, but we can't tell that because it's not a part of our solar system.

      "answer": "It is not unusual for vaccines to require multiple stabs for full efficiency. After the first injection you get a strong response from the immune system that will be able to get rid of the vaccine. But you only get a partial respons from the memory cells that is responsible for helping the immune system recognizing future infections. So another injection as the first immune response have died down can help increase the number of memory cells. As for why there is exactly 3 weeks between the stabs for the BioNTech vaccine is because that was what they used in their stage 3 trial so that is what have been certified. Most of the vaccines we administer have had a lot of testing to figure out how they are most efficient while they wait for the paperwork to complete. But for vaccines like the coronavirus vaccines as well as the seasonal flu we do not have time for this so we just make educated guesses and run trials to make sure this is safe and effective.  There are lots of indications suggesting that the BioNTech vaccine works just fine with just one shot. The trial can be interpreted as low as 65% efficiency after three weeks but some suggest this might be as high as 98% after five weeks with just one stab.

If they're jiggling a lot, then they're very hot. If they're not jiggling much, then it's cold.

If you light a match, the energy from the match causes the atoms to jiggle even more meaning it's heating up more. If you throw a ball in the gas, every atom it hits gains energy, and then hits a bunch of other atoms causing the entire gas to gain jiggling while slowing down the ball (air friction).  Now how do you remove the jiggling from the gas? There is a concept in physics called entropy. Smashing an egg on the ground is very easy to do.

If you throw a ball in the gas, every atom it hits gains energy, and then hits a bunch of other atoms causing the entire gas to gain jiggling while slowing down the ball (air friction).  Now how do you remove the jiggling from the gas? There is a concept in physics called entropy. Smashing an egg on the ground is very easy to do. Putting the egg back together again takes a lot of time and effort. Similarly, getting a billion gas molecules to jiggle is easy. Getting them all to stop jiggling is very hard and takes effort.

      "answer": "The key to ISO 9001 is documented processes.  In your audit, you will get a list of processes that the company says describe what the \"shipping\" department does.  You will seek out examples of each process.  Then you will examine the records for all the instances of work that uses the process to see if any instances didn't follow the process (perhaps by following a different process).  Then you will audit the work that is left, to see if there is work going on for which there is no process (sometimes called orphan work).   All your observations will be written up in an audit report, which the assessors will use (with audit reports from all the company's other departments) to determine where the company meets the standards and where it does not.  The assessment team will explain how they want this done/documented.",

And my understanding is that (perversely) it's not part of the audit to say how good or otherwise the process is - it's ultimately their business, not yours. Simply, can they demonstrate that they follow their processes?  It's one reason why, when the shoe's on the other foot, you should never be unnecessarily *over*-specific in laying out your processes.

You will seek out examples of each process.  Then you will examine the records for all the instances of work that uses the process to see if any instances didn't follow the process (perhaps by following a different process).  Then you will audit the work that is left, to see if there is work going on for which there is no process (sometimes called orphan work).   All your observations will be written up in an audit report, which the assessors will use (with audit reports from all the company's other departments) to determine where the company meets the standards and where it does not.

A 100 watt amp can put out 2000 watts of power for a millisecond before stuff blows up.  A human body can sustain 100's of G's for an extremely short period of time.  A 5 amp fuse can pass 100's of amps, for a very short time before it blows.  A particle can reach many millions of degrees before it falls apart.",

      "question": "ELI5: If lightning takes the shortest path to the ground, why is it all jagged-like in the sky, and not a straight line?",
      "answer": "How a lightning bolt (or any electric arc) forms:  1. Two opposite charge distributions build up in the clouds and ground, creating a voltage between the two and therefor an electric field distributed in the space between them.  2. In some area, usually near a sharp point in one of the charge distributions, the electric field exceeds the breakdown strength of air, stripping electrons from the air molecules and causing that area to become conductive.  3. Charge from the charge distribution flows into this area until it is at the same voltage. That small patch of volume is now a conductive extension of the charge distribution.  4. There is now the same voltage between the two charge distributions, and at a slightly smaller distance, further concentrating the electric field between the two, which will lead to further breakdown of the air.  5. This process repeats continuously until a full conductive path of ionized air is created between the charge distributions. At which point the entirety of the charge will flow and the two opposite charge distributions will neutralize each other. As the charge is depleted, the electric field will weaken, and no new paths will be formed, first path to ground wins.  So why is the path jagged?  If you took two metal plates, one at 0v and one at 12v, there would be an electric field evenly distributed between them. Now if you took a third plate at 0v and put it between the other two, the electric field would be concentrated between the middle plate and the 12v plate, the presence of the middle plate has deprived the outer 0v plate of its surrounding electric field.  It works similarly in lightning, streamers lower to the ground will block the progress of streamers above, streamers to the sides of other streamers will tend to redirect them away. Each one at any instant will progress in the direction of the strongest electric field, and they will influence each other\u2019s electric fields to point away from each other.  The geometry of the charge distributions and the shape of the streamers at any instant during the process will ultimately determine the path of lightning.  The \u201cpath of least resistance\u201d explanation is not true and this isn\u2019t even rigorously well defined when you think about it. The charge distributions will build up along the surfaces facing each other, you could pick two points on these surfaces and find the path between them which has the smallest line integral of resistivity along it. But which two points? The answer will be different for different points. And the resistivity of the various sections of air is dynamically changing as the conductive path is being formed, so the path of least resistance is constantly changing too. Not to mention the resistivity of air should only be dependent on its temperature, pressure and humidity which will not vary so much for neighboring patches of air, so you wouldn\u2019t expect such a jagged path if it was truly resistance driving the process. It would be a straight line or have a slight but smooth curve to account for the changing pressure, temperature and humidity as a function of altitude.  So it\u2019s not the path of least resistance, it\u2019s a complex result of the instantaneous geometry of the charge distributions and current locations of the other streamers which will guide a streamer in one direction or the other. I don\u2019t think there is a simple way to characterize the path which lightning will ultimately take in any given situation.",

      "question": "Eli5: Why did people taste metal in their mouths at Chernobyl during the disaster?",
      "answer": "The taste that we associate with metal is actually your brain's generic error response to nonsensical taste information coming from your mouth.  Anything that causes the neurons in your taste buds to begin firing off randomly will produce a metal taste.  The reason that we associate the taste with metal is because the most common way to cause temporary dysfunction in your taste buds is by putting something made out of metal in your mouth.  Metal itself has no taste.  When you put a metal object in your mouth you're creating an environment that is very similar to a weak battery.  This creates a very slight electrical current within your mouth, triggering the neurons in your taste buds to malfunction.  Your brain doesn't doesn't know how to process that information and you end up tasting \"error\".    The reason that we associate the taste of \"error\" with that of metal is because sticking something metal in your mouth is a pretty common occurrence for most kids - so its pretty likely that the first time you taste \"error\" will be the result of putting metal in your mouth.  There isn't a whole lot other than metal that will produce an error taste, so because the only experience most people will have had with the taste is sticking a metal object in their mouth, they associate the taste with metal.  One of the few other things that will cause the taste buds in your mouth to malfunction is high levels of radiation.  That radiation both  directly damages the taste buds and has an interaction with your saliva that creates a slight electrical current in your mouth.  The end result is that your taste buds begin firing off randomly and generate the \"error\" taste that people typically associate with metal.",

      "question": "ELI5: How does light travel in space?",
      "answer": "Sound is what happens when the particles in a material push against each other in a wave. Honestly, it\u2019s very similar to just waves you would see in the ocean. Particles bunch up into a wave, and then spread out between the waves.   Light on the other hand, is what happens when the electromagnetic field oscillates.   To explain that a bit more, imagine a magnet. When you hold the magnet near a piece of iron, the iron will get pulled towards the magnet. The strength of the pull depends on how far away the magnet is though. If the magnet is basically touching the iron, it gets pulled really hard, but if the magnet is on the other side of the room, it hardly pulls the iron at all.   That \u201cpull\u201d is analogous to the magnetic field. When the iron is being pulled strongly, the magnetic field put out by the magnet is strong at the iron\u2019s location. When the iron is hardly being pulled, the magnetic field is pretty weak. As a disclaimer, this isn\u2019t a completely accurate way to picture the magnetic field, since it also has a direction, but it\u2019s close enough.   Now, that \u201cpull\u201d doesn\u2019t have to travel through any matter. It\u2019s not like the magnet is sending a pulse through the air telling the iron to come towards it. The magnetic field fills up all of \u201cempty\u201d space, so a magnet could pull iron even in empty space, without any air.   Now, another thing to understand is that the magnetic field, what we were just talking about, and the electric field, which makes charged particles attract/repel each other, are connected. The important bit here is that when a magnetic field changes, it causes the electric field nearby to change as well.   That means that if you cause a change in the magnetic field, say by moving a magnet away, that change will cause a pulse in the electric field.   Where it gets weird is that changes in the electric field do the same thing. When you change the electric field, it will cause a magnetic field to appear.   So, let\u2019s say you move a magnet away quickly. That will cause the magnetic field in the area to drop off suddenly. That change in the magnetic field will make a pulse in the electric field just ahead of it. But now, if the electric field just pulsed, that means it changed, and a changing electric field causes a magnetic field. So that pulse in the electric field causes its own pulse in the magnetic field just ahead. Again though, the magnetic field just changed, so you get an electric pulse. The electric pulse causes a magnetic pulse, which causes an electric pulse, which causes a magnetic pulse, which causes\u2026  Anyway, you can see how that makes a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields propagate along through space.   Btw, wiggling a magnet does actually make light, but you can\u2019t wiggle it fast enough to make visible light, sadly. You can make some really low energy radio waves though!  **TL;DR** *Light isn\u2019t a matter wave, it\u2019s an electromagnetic wave that propagates through electric and magnetic fields. \u201cEmpty\u201d space isn\u2019t actually empty, and it still has those fields in it, so light can wiggle its way through those fields to travel in space*",

      "question": "ELI5: How does light travel in space?",
      "answer": "Sound is what happens when the particles in a material push against each other in a wave. Honestly, it\u2019s very similar to just waves you would see in the ocean. Particles bunch up into a wave, and then spread out between the waves.   Light on the other hand, is what happens when the electromagnetic field oscillates.   To explain that a bit more, imagine a magnet. When you hold the magnet near a piece of iron, the iron will get pulled towards the magnet. The strength of the pull depends on how far away the magnet is though. If the magnet is basically touching the iron, it gets pulled really hard, but if the magnet is on the other side of the room, it hardly pulls the iron at all.   That \u201cpull\u201d is analogous to the magnetic field. When the iron is being pulled strongly, the magnetic field put out by the magnet is strong at the iron\u2019s location. When the iron is hardly being pulled, the magnetic field is pretty weak. As a disclaimer, this isn\u2019t a completely accurate way to picture the magnetic field, since it also has a direction, but it\u2019s close enough.   Now, that \u201cpull\u201d doesn\u2019t have to travel through any matter. It\u2019s not like the magnet is sending a pulse through the air telling the iron to come towards it. The magnetic field fills up all of \u201cempty\u201d space, so a magnet could pull iron even in empty space, without any air.   Now, another thing to understand is that the magnetic field, what we were just talking about, and the electric field, which makes charged particles attract/repel each other, are connected. The important bit here is that when a magnetic field changes, it causes the electric field nearby to change as well.   That means that if you cause a change in the magnetic field, say by moving a magnet away, that change will cause a pulse in the electric field.   Where it gets weird is that changes in the electric field do the same thing. When you change the electric field, it will cause a magnetic field to appear.   So, let\u2019s say you move a magnet away quickly. That will cause the magnetic field in the area to drop off suddenly. That change in the magnetic field will make a pulse in the electric field just ahead of it.

If the ebook is popular and the item keeps getting reserves on it, then we have to keep buying licenses.

The short answer is that publishers don't sell the electronic items to libraries, they license them with certain conditions; To offer 6 copies for circulation we have to buy 6 licenses, usually at a rate much higher than you could buy it through Amazon. Each of these licenses are single-use, meaning only one check-out at a time is allowed.  But wait! There's more!  Part of the purchase license is a limit to how many times that one licensed ebook can be circulated - and that's often a rather small number. So those 6 copies/licenses, maybe each can only circ 10 times, so really we only get 60 circs out of it. If the ebook is popular and the item keeps getting reserves on it, then we have to keep buying licenses.  Now our regular paper books, which we buy at a price just higher than retail (often reinforced bindings) can circ 20 or more times before they fall apart, so the license model means we pay significantly more per circ.  For us, as a library, and ebook, audiobook, or any other electronic item ISN'T any different that a paper book. We catalog and track them in exactly the same way. Not because it's easier or anything, but because book/item circulation is the most important metric we use in both funding and budget planning.

      "answer": "The other two comments nailed the whole metric versus imperial thing, but its actually a fair bit more complex than that. Never fear, I'm your friendly neighborhood gun guy.  \"50 cal\" is a term that most people attribute to .50 BMG, but .50 BMG is definitely not the only .50 caliber cartridge. The reason that most calibers have either a military designation (5.56x45mm, 7.62x39mm) or a word after the caliber designation is because no two calibers are exactly the same.  In the case of x.xx*xx mm, those are military designations, usually NATO. They denote the diameter of the bullet, and the length of the brass case. But for more Imperial calibers, you'll see \".30-06 Springfield,\" \".270 Winchester,\" \".223 Remington,\" \"9mm Parabellum,\" \".45 ACP,\" etc.  The diameter of the bullet is a small part of the equation. For example, there is 9x19mm, aka 9mm Parabellum, or just 9mm. But there are tons of calibers with a 9mm diameter bullet. .380 Auto, .357 Magnum, 9x18 Makarov, 9x39 Soviet, etc. The differences come from case length and design, and powder load. More powder with the same bullet means more force on target.  You would be correct in saying, \".45 ACP is a bigger bullet than 5.56.\" But 45 ACP is designed for handguns, and as such has a shorter case and smaller powder load. This helps keep the guns, well, handguns, and helps with controllability under recoil.  There are probably thousands of \"30 cal\" calibers in this world, and they do not all perform the same, and most likely won't fit and fire safely in guns not specifically marked for them.  .50 BMG is probably the largest caliber that you can own without filling out paperwork for a Destructive Device from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Because somebody decided at some point that any firearm with a bore larger than half an inch was essentially a cannon.  When looking at terminal ballistics (how good is this bullet at breaking that thing), you have to take into consideration bullet size, bullet weight, and powder load at a minimum. 9mm has a smaller powder load than 45 ACP, and pushes a smaller bullet (about half the weight) about 30% faster. 5.56 on the other hand, is basically pushing a .22 at 2800-3100 feet per second, around 3x as fast as the 9mm.  What could help you greatly in your understanding is to go on the interwebs and find a picture of a few calibers side by side.

      "answer": "Computers follow a series of instructions. They do each step before performing the next. In a single-threaded environment, if one instruction takes a long time, it holds up the entire process.  Multithreading gives sets of instructions which can be run in parallel. If you have multiple CPUs or if the CPU has multiple cores, it can give each one its own set of instructions so they can really be done at the same time. Even if not, a single CPU can switch back and forth between multiple threads, making a little progress on one before switching to the other.  A standard example in programming is with the user interface. Say you click on a button that does some sort of long-running analysis. With a single-threaded application, as soon as you push the button, all the tasks used to keep the user interface responsive are held up. The button look like it is still pressed even after you let go of the mouse, and you can't move the window or press any other control in the interface until the analysis is complete. In a multi-threaded environment, the analysis would be put on another thread. It can do its thing while the thread that keeps the user interface responsive does its job as well.",

      "answer": "In engineering risk assessment there is a theory called the cheese model. Imagine many slices of cheese, each with some holes in random positions. Each slice of cheese represents one entity in the engineering project, and holes represent safety holes in that one entity. A risk factor (hole) in one entity can be blocked by another entity. However, sometimes you're unlucky and all the holes align. Everything is at the wrong place at the same time, and disaster happens.   Truth is, humans *will* make mistakes. It is unavoidable. Any attempts to reduce risk *will* cause risks of its own. The best we can do is to have many layers of cheese (safety mechanism) so that the chance of holes aligning (all safety mechanisms failing) is as small as possible. The desire to blame a single entity for disasters is not only wrong, but also makes the entire system prone to future disasters. If we only blame one slice of cheese for the entire disaster, problems in every other slice of cheese is not fixed, or even worse, those holes get larger due to complacency.",

I get that most engineering disasters nowadays cannot be narrowed down to such a small amount of issues - but this seems to be an exception to the rule. This sort of fire was, with the benefit of hindsight, entirely predictable based on the pre existing conditions wasn't it?

Transfer of a significant amount of energy requires a process called energy transfer.   If the object is just an object that exists and moves in space, then transfer of the energy would be no problem.  If it were a moving object that moved in a direction that required energy, then the transfer would be from the observer to the moving object.
