      ">As a sidebar to the main answer, it may seem like passenger aircraft haven\u2019t changed much in 60 years: same basic shape, similar speed.  But there\u2019s one huge advance that isn\u2019T obvious: fuel efficiency.    >This has been achieved through bigger planes with more seats, but mostly through phenomenal improvements in engine technology.  >Today\u2019m aircraft are **10 times more fuel efficient than they were in the 1950s   This is a bit of a stretch, but it\u2019d be wrong to say that the technology has improved only in a way that\u2019ll be obvious to passengers.  The fuel efficiency gains made by today\u2019re planes are not necessarily because of the technology they use, but because of how efficient they are.  For example, the fuel burned per passenger is now 10 times higher than it was in the early 60s.  This has been possible through bigger plane with more passengers, but also through phenomenal advances in engine design.  And that\u2018s not even counting the fact that the engines are quieter, which has helped reduce noise.  So the fuel consumption of planes has also improved.  It\u2019ve just been a matter of figuring out how to make the technology quieter and quieter.  That\u2019S the key.  I think the fuel efficiency gain is the key, not the quieter planes.  If you can get quieter planes quieter, you can probably get more passengers.",

    "follow-up": "And perhaps the biggest cause of that fuel burn decrease is the switch from turbojet engines to turbofans. A modern turbofan has very much in common with a turboprop, in that 90% of the thrust is generated by the fan in the front of the engine (pretty much a propeller with 20-30(?) blades).

The burning of fuels has dropped by so much because of the efficiency of the fuel used, that it no longer makes sense to burn more fuel.  So why isn't it burning more?",

I remember my dad (who worked for a major airline, commenting about how flights to Southern California took 45 minutes longer than when he started even though the planes were faster, all due to traffic and airport issues.  He said it was because of the on-and-off ramp issues and the fact that planes were having to wait for the tower to clear before they could take off.  I don\u2019ts know if that's the case for other countries, but I remember flying to the east coast and back and it took about the same amount of time.  The reason I ask is because I remember a friend of mine flying to Florida once and the flight was about an hour and a half. He said the flight took 45 mins because of delays and on the ground taxiing.  It was a very long flight.  So I asked him why it took so long.  Because it was a major airport and they had to wait to take off because of on-ground operations.  And he said it wasn\u2019T because of planes, it was just because of traffic.  That\u2019s a good explanation.  Also, I remember the time it took him to get to Florida. He was flying from Atlanta to Phoenix and back. He had a lot faster than usual.  But he said the reason was because the airport was more crowded.  What I don't get is that it was more planes and more planes were taking off.",
      "So the benefit of increased speed is marginal?",
      "I'm not sure how you can tell the difference between the average and the fastest flight. I'm assuming the difference is based on the speed of the plane and the amount of time it takes to get to the airport.    I'm not saying that the speed difference is insignificant, but I'm asking that you consider that the average flight time is already significantly longer than the fastest.  I know that the number of passengers on a plane is increasing, but the average time of the flight is still significantly slower than the average person flying.  If you can get to your destination in a reasonable amount of speed, you'll probably see more people on the plane than if you were flying at a slower speed.  The reason why is that the planes are moving slower is because of the need to maneuver through the air.  So if you can make your plane go faster, you're just slowing down the air traffic and slowing down your passengers.  This is a good argument, but it's not the only argument.  Also, if you're flying to a new city, you might be able to get a more direct flight to your new city.  But if you take a plane to a different city, it's still going to take a while to get there because of all the planes and planes and all the different things they have to deal with.  And if you want to get from one city to another, you have to take an extra flight.  It's not like you can just hop on a 747 and hop off at the next city and hop on the next plane.  You have to wait for a plane and then wait for another plane to arrive.  That's the whole point of having a plane.",
      "That makes sense. But why does it take so long?",
      "Thanks for your reply!  I was thinking about a recent trip to California. I was flying Southwest and it took me about 45 minutes to get there. I'm not sure if that's the reason or if it was just the traffic or the airport issues but it was a long flight.   I'm guessing it was the traffic and airport issues that took so long though.  I've flown a lot and it always seemed like the planes were going to take longer than usual.  If they were, why didn't they just add more fuel?    Or maybe it was because they were just more tired and they were more stressed out from flying so much.",

    "answer": "There's a lot of controversy over what causes a side stitch. I've studied it over the years and with well over 200,000 running miles I have plenty of experience. For me, a side stitch comes about from stomach muscles not being synchronized with breathing. Think of it as your chest muscles pulling up as your abdominal muscles pull down. I'm sure that's not technically correct, but that's the effect you experience when the muscles are strained. It can be eliminated/reduced by concentrating on breathing on one side or the other, generally your dominant side. When that foot strikes the ground, you want to be exhaling. Focusing on this will help synchronize the muscles and stop the stitch. There are other causes that increase the likelihood of stitches such as dehydration or stress.",

      "> Only periods 1 and 2 are restricted to a maximum of 8 valence electrons    This is a bit of a stretch, but I think it's a reasonable way to look at it.   The inner shell of an atom has a number of holes that can be filled with either a single electron or a series of holes.  The holes are filled with a mixture of protons and neutrons, and the electrons are arranged in a way that allows them to move freely around the shell.  In the case of a hydrogen atom, the holes are the same size as the nucleus, but the electrons move around the outside of the shell, so the electrons can move freely between them.  This arrangement allows the hydrogen atom to have a maximum number of electrons, but it's not ideal.  If you want to know why, you need to know about the atomic number of the hydrogen nucleus.  It's not just that there are more electrons, there are also more atoms.  But the number of atoms is limited because hydrogen atoms are made up of a mixture that contains a mixture between protons, neutrons and a mixture.  So if you want a hydrogen nucleus with a maximum amount of electrons (because it's easier to calculate), you need a combination of atoms with a higher number of proton and neutron electrons, and atoms with lower number of electron electrons.  And that's why hydrogen atoms have a higher atomic number than helium atoms.",

    "question": "ELI5 How does sound wave energy get converted into electricity and why is it less efficient than solar energy?",
    "answer": "The microphone reflects *a lot* of the sound energy that hits it.  Your simple microphone is like a tiny speaker in reverse where sound hits the diaphragm (little movable plate) and pushes a magnet in and out of a coil of wire.  This little diaphragm is hard on the surface which means that a lot of the sound energy hits it and bounces off rather than being absorbed in pushing the magnet through the coil.  There are little capacitor based ones but the magnet setup is easiest to understand as a reversed speaker.  Solar panels on the other hand are very absorbant of the frequencies they work with.  Some percentage is reflected off the top glass layer but 90% of the light will pass through and then be absorbed down below.  The efficiency of solar panels mostly comes down to the sun emitting light over a wide range of frequencies and our little solar panels only being able to absorb a small range of frequencies which is why the best case efficiency of a single junction solar panel is just 37% because that's the bigger window we can make in the highest energy portion of the sun's spectrum.  Another issue with capturing sound energy is that there just really isn't all that much of it.  If you were to stand 1 meter away from a jet engine its sound level is around 150 dB, but if you were to capture *all* the sound energy from that jet engine it'd be around 1000 W, a 150 dB sound only gives you 1000 W of energy to work with.  You can get that much energy with about 5 m^2 of solar panels and you won't have a giant turbofan engine screaming away in the background.",
    "follow-up": "Gotcha, that makes a lot of sense! So it's a combination of inefficient sound capturing (would need a VERY sensitive diaphragm) and the general low dBs that could be captured..

The document itself is an object. Each object can have child objects (the p, h1 and img in the above example are children of the parent document; the span element is a child of the second p element). An object can have also attributes (src and alt are attributes of the img element object; \"This is text\" is the text attribute of the p element object).  Because these markup languages allow for nested (child) elements, the whole thing can be represented as a tree structure, which is the **model**.  Note that the document doesn't have to be a literal file, it can and often does only exist in memory. For HTML, the browser is responsible for parsing the HTML text and building the DOM model in memory. The DOM can then be manipulated by eg. JavaScript but it doesn't change the actual HTML file.

What a zip bomb does is compress a file that is made up of many repeating sequences; it is garbage but it can be made much smaller, so the compressed file is fractions of a percent of the uncompressed file.  The result is that when you try to open the archive the computer tries to write an absurdly large file to disk. This cannot really damage the computer, it won't destroy data or anything irreversible, but it can be annoying to fill up all remaining drive space.",

    "question": "ELI5: What is this magical amount of enriched uranium that is needed for a nuclear bomb?; Part 2: Why is it that amount?; Bonus: how close is Iran to that amount?",
    "answer": "It's not magic. A nuclear bomb is an engineering device that creates the conditions for an out-of-control nuclear fission reaction.   Each U-235 atom can be split (fissioned) with a neutron. When it splits, it releases 2-3 neutrons of its own (plus some energy). Each neutron can go only a few centimeters before it disintegrates. For a bomb to work, you need those 2-3 neutrons to split more U-235 atoms, which then split more, which then split more, and so on.   If the amount of uranium you have is too small, the neutrons will eventually reach the surface and escape. The chances of them hitting more U-235 atoms will not be high enough to continue the reaction.  So the \"magic amount\" \u2014\u00a0the critical mass \u2014 is the amount of U-235 you need so that you have the conditions where lots of reactions will take place.   The thing of it is, there are different ways to design a bomb. For example, if you put a neutron reflector around the fuel, those neutrons will have a harder time escaping, so you will need less U-235 for it to work. The main bomb design \"trick\" that people use is called implosion, where you use high explosives to squeeze a ball of fuel into a higher density, so the atoms are closer together \u2014 again, to increase the chance of those neutrons finding more atoms.   There are other tricks as well that can be used to increase the efficiency, many of which get beyond ELI5 levels of explanation. The goal of them is to make more material react, which either means you need less material for a given amount of \"boom,\" or you add more fuel and get a bigger explosion.  So the exact amount you need can vary by bomb design. The lower limits are kept pretty secret but it is clear that with 5 kg or even less of material, with a very sophisticated design, you can get a pretty good explosion. For a very crude design, like the one used on Hiroshima (where you are just shooting two pieces of U-235 together), you could need more than 60 kg. So there is a big gap between those two extremes, though in the end even the \"high end\" is not a huge amount.   Separately, with U-235, the level of enrichment (how much U-235 versus U-238 there is) makes a difference to that amount as well. If you have 93% U-235 (7% U-238), you will need less material than, say, 80% U-235 (20% U-238). U-238 inhibits the reaction and so you will need more U-235 to increase the chance of it fissioning.  If this still sounds confusing, you might enjoy playing around with my [Critical Assembly Simulator](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/misc/criticality/), which allows one to simulate in a \"toy\" way how these reactions work. You can tweak the variables (enrichment, total mass, reflection, implosion, etc.) and see how that changes how the reaction operates.   In terms of how close Iran is to the amount, Iran currently has uranium enriched at the level of 20%. That is not enough for a bomb. It is, however, not that far from 90% \u2014\u00a0a lot less far than it seems (enrichment is not linear; it is more \"work\" to go from 0.7% to 20% than it is 20% to 90%).   To make a bomb, Iran would likely need to build up a stockpile of several dozen kilograms of uranium enriched to at least 80%, more favorable at least 90%. They have said that they will make at most 120 kg of 20% enriched uranium. If they turned all of that into 90% enriched uranium with perfect efficiency, they would have around 25 kg of U-235. That would likely be enough for a few implosion bombs (but not enough for a crude bomb). They would also of course have to do the work of weaponizing it, and need a way to actually launch it (missile warheads, etc.) \u2014 not impossible, but these things take additional time and testing.   In terms of \"how close,\" it really depends on what you assume they are going to be doing politically. They do not appear to be trying to make a bomb just yet. They are clearly positioning themselves to make the West uncomfortable, though, with the idea that if they threw everything they had into making a bomb \u2014 which would be a very obvious sort of move, and require them flagrantly violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \u2014 they might be able to make the material in a matter of months.   Note that Iran's uranium stockpiles and facilities are under close scrutiny not only by the International Atomic Energy Agency (which has cameras in each of them, linked back to their headquarters in Vienna), but the intelligence services of many nations (USA, Israel, no doubt others). So this would be a very blatant act. It doesn't mean they couldn't try it (North Korea pulled out of the NPT in 2003, and tested a bomb in 2006), but it is not the kind of overnight \"they suddenly secretly have a nuke\" that many people fear.",

    "answer": "Two things: first, many plants *can't* be easily grown hydroponically.  Second is that the difference between soil and hydroponics is more than just \"replace dirt with water\". Hydroponics systems tend to have highly managed biochemistry making sure the plants get exactly the nutrients they need and nothing else. Soil, on the other hand, is a natural environment which contains not only all sorts of minerals and chemicals but also living creatures like bacteria, fungi, even insects. It's naturally balanced to support the plant, but if you disturb that balance (for example, by adding way more water than it would naturally get), it stops being a good environment for plant growth. Minerals could be overextracted or washed away. Organisms could be drowned or could overpopulate and invade. It's simply not managed in the same way a hydroponics system is managed.",
    "follow-up": "> It's naturally balanced to support the plant, but if you disturb that balance (for example, by adding way more water than it would naturally get), it stops being a good environment for plant growth.   This is the best answer.  Both systems (soil/hydroponics) require some form of balance and maintenance. Things like ph, oxygenation, nutrient content matter to both systems.  It's not that water is inherently evil. What the OP's question actually is is \"why is it when I knock my soil system out of whack/balance it damages plants when my carefully maintained hydroponic system doesn't\".

And secondly, if your system is not designed to manage the amount of nutrients you're getting, you can't overwater the plants.

Therefore, the earth can't rotate once per second.  It's not a constant motion of the Earth.  If the earth were to turn clockwise, it would be the day, and the night would be  the night.  This would mean that the day would be equal in duration to the night, and therefore the day wouldn't be equal to the day.

    "answer": "Quieter noises are less likely to trigger our startle reflex.   The startle reflex is a reaction in the brain that kicks the body into immediate action to protect itself, bypassing all conscious thought. This has evolved to happen VERY quickly following the sudden dangerous stimulus (aka sounds of a certain volume), while stimuli that don't trigger this reflex don't elicit as quick a reaction time.  There are multiple different reflexes that occur during a startle response, such as in the eye, jaw, head, etc. But the \"acoustic startle reflex\" specifically has its own neural pathway.  If you have really high anxiety, a phobia, or other related problems, your threshold for your startle reflex will be lower than other people's, and stimuli that other people wouldn't startle to will startle you.",

I've never heard of anyone with a phobic disorder having a lower threshold for their startle response.   I'm not saying that's true, but I've heard that people with phobias tend to react more to loud noises than others.  If you're sitting in a room with a group of people and suddenly someone walks in, you'll jump up and cover your ears.  This happens because your brain is trying to figure out if it's a person or a noise, and if it is a noise it's trying to decide which one to freak out about.  But if you're in a group with people who don't have a phobia, you're probably not as likely to get startled by a loud noise.  And if you are in a crowd with people with a tendency to freak, you might be less likely to react to a loud sound than someone who doesn't.  The reason I ask is because I've been in a situation where I've had a very high threshold for the startle reaction.  When I hear a loud song, I jump out of my skin and cover my ears. I've always been able to do this despite the fact that I'm terrified of loud music.  It's because of the way my brain interprets loud music, and because of how fast it happens.

    "question": "ELI5: If my VR headset display has a limited and certain amount of pixels, how do games upscale pixel density beyond full resolution?",
    "answer": "I believe you're talking about VR Supersampling. Essential your computer screen (or VR screens in this case) can only output a certain resolution of pixels.(this is called the \"Native resolution\") Each pixel can only display one color at a time. When these pixels do not line up perfectly vertically or horizontally they can look jagged. (Imagine drawing a straight line on MS paint: totally smooth. Now draw a 45\u00b0 angled line: looks like a staircase) This jagged effect is called aliasing. To mitigate this effect, games offer anti-aliasing features such as Supersampling.  Supersampling renders an image at a higher resolution than the computer screen can output, takes an average of the pixel colors in an area and blends them all together, displaying the blended colors at the native resolution. This sort of smooths the edges of those not perfectly straight lines so that they appear less jagged and more natural.   So, your screen is still displaying the same amount of pixels, and the pixels are only displaying one color each, but the colors displayed by each pixel are slightly different.",

      ">Imagine drawing a straight line on MS paint: totally smooth. Now draw a 45\u00b0 angled line: looks like a staircase) This jagged effect is called aliasing.  In games, it's usually done in the context of a scene where the edges of the image are jagged, and the game uses the aliasing to smooth out the edges so that the image appears less jagged and more natural.   In the case of a game where the scene is rendered in a higher resolution, it might look jagged because the edges are not perfectly aligned, but because the game is using a higher amount of pixels, it can appear more natural and realistic.  This is because the pixels are being processed in a way that preserves the original colors, but makes them appear more \"realistic\" in a manner that makes them look more \"lit\" and \"real\".    This isn't necessarily true for every game though. For example, if I'm playing GTA San Andreas in a PS4, the game will probably still look fine in 1080p, but if I put it in a Vive, it will probably look worse because the resolution is lower.  Because the pixels in the game are being \"sampled\" in some way, the edges will appear jagged.  With a higher pixel density, it could mean that the edges on the game itself are not smooth, and that the game may appear less realistic in some ways.  But if I have a higher-resolution PS4 Pro, it may look worse in some places because the image is being processed differently than it would be in a lower-resolution PC.  So if I want to play GTA San Antonio in a 1080p PC, I need to upscale the resolution of my graphics card so that it looks more realistic.",

      ">A typical server will have no or fewer graphical components (display ports, graphics processors, and much higher specs than core components    How do you know that?   I'm not a computer engineer, but I've seen some graphs that show the number of graphics cards per megabyte (or megabyte) of storage.   So, if you have a server with 4 graphics cards, and 4 x 8+ CPU cores, you'd need a total of ~100+ graphics cards (4x the number that are used in a typical Googles server).   That's assuming that you're using the same number of GPUs per megabit of storage (4 x 8, or 4 x 4, or 8).  So if you're going to use the same amount of graphics processors per megaboule of storage, you'll need a lot more than that.  So the total amount of processing and storage will be the sum of all the processing and memory, minus the relevant overheads (for processing there is an overhead for synchronizing many servers over a network, for storage there is a overhead in coordinating disconnected disks).  That would be the total processing and data center power.  That is the total power of the data center.  And that's assuming you're not talking about the compute side of things.",

    "answer": "The number i is \"imaginary\" in the same way negative numbers are imaginary.  You can't have negative sheep in a barn. The whole concept is made-up, but we figured out that if we continue the number line past zero, we can use those made-up numbers in tons of different ways, namely, to represent something that flips between two states. Above freezing vs. below freezing, credit vs. debt, clockwise vs. counter-clockwise, so on.  The number i is just taking that concept further and extending the number line perpendicularly up and down. Like negative numbers, this extension gives us tools to describe a more cyclic kind of flipping: instead of simply going from 1 to -1, we can rotate around 0 by going up to i and then below to -i in between.  The exact applications of that are somewhat obscure and math-heavy, but they pop up in equations modeling many periodic motions and waveforms. Since a sine wave happens in two dimensions, having a number system in place which can work in two dimensions is immensely useful. Fourier transformation, for example, is incredibly common in all kinds of signal handling, and it relies on the complex plane. That's an ELI5 of its own, but [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) has a visual introduction if you're interested in it.",

Sure, I could do math on the forward and back (1 dimension), do math on the up and down (1 dimension), and add them up with magic.

    "question": "ELI5: What makes electrons negative and protons positive?",
    "answer": "The choice of electrons as negative was *not* just arbitrary. When early experiments were done before electrons were discovered, it was shown that electricity moves from positive towards negative. This seems counterintuitive at first, because it's the electrons that are moving, right? So electrons are moving from negative to positive, but the *charge* is moving from positive to negative.  Imagine a long line of cars sitting at a red light. When the light turns green, the car at the front of the line moves first. Even though the cars are coming from the back and moving forward, the apparent movement of the *whole line* of cars starts at the front. If you couldn't see individual cars, and they were all the same color, you would see just one long line of *something*. When the first car moves, it would open up a gap or a *hole* behind that car, which the next car would move up to fill. If you were in a helicopter and you had very blurry vision, you'd probably notice that hole appearing to move.  Similarly, when electrons move they leave behind a positively charged \"hole\". Before any electron can move, there has to be a hole in font of it. And when you do math and make models and predictions, you can pretend that the hole acts like a positively charged particle, because it kind of moves around like one. Instead of an electron jumping around, it *looks* like there's a positively charged particle jumping around. Keep in mind that unlike cars, electrons don't slowly travel from one atom to the next: instead, they are around one atom, and then they just *are* at a different atom. They jump across the gap without appearing to move (although they do take time to get there). So without seeing the electrons move individually, it really does look like an overall positive charge is the thing moving.  Thus, early experiments showed that charge came from the end that they labeled as *positive*. After generations, the electron was found but by then the convention was already set, so electrons were stuck as being labeled *negative*. As for why charged particles have charge at all - it's an intrinsic part of the universe and how those particles interact with it. They just kind of...do.",

Let's say I founded XYZ Corp. and I hold shares worth $50B. I take $1/yr in salary. I sell $50M worth of shares each year, and pay capital gains taxes on those. Highest capital gains tax rate is 20%. So if I sell $50M (and assume basically $0 initial cost), then I'd pay $10M in taxes. No matter how valuable my shares become, I only pay taxes when I sell, so if my shares were only worth $25B last year and are now worth $50B , there is no taxable event on that new $25B in wealth.  But wealthy can also borrow money rather than sell off shares, using those shares as collateral. Maybe I borrowed $50M to live off of last year instead of selling shares, paying a low interest rate due to my super low default  risk. Maybe it's 3% annually. Meanwhile, my money in my shares are growing at a much faster rate than that. I can basically keep just paying interest only on amount borrowed, take out new loans, etc. to keep money in my metaphorical pocket without liquidating shares of stock that would require paying capital gains.

    "question": "Eli5: Convertible notes, how do they really work and what\u2019s the catch?",
    "answer": "Convertible notes are fantastic for startups, especially when things are new or uncertain.  The note buys equity in your company... but not now, it buys it at some point in the future (generally on your next round of funding). Until then its treated like a loan, which generates interest, but you don't pay it off like a loan. It will be \"paid off\" when it becomes equity at that later date in the future for the full value. That is--you never pay out the loan in cash, its paid off in stock, later. Think of it as getting money now, for selling stock in the future.  For example, a convertible note for $50k at 20% means the owner of the company gets $50k now, and will have to give away $50k + 20% interest in equity later.  Lets say in exactly 1 year, you close out the note and give the equity.  You'd give out $60k in equity ($50k + 20% of $50k).  Convertible notes are great when its hard to judge the valuation of a company now, but you will be able to later, it also keeps equity control of the company with the owner and avoid a lot of really complicated financial and legal process of issuing shares.  Convertible notes are often the name of the game for new companies looking to sell equity. Although it doesn't come cheap, rates of 15%-40% are normal.  **tl;dr**: A convertible note gives you money now in exchange for stock in the future",

You're trying to keep that thing at a very specific pressure close to the boiler's breaking point, because you're trying to measure how the boiler behaves when it's really close to failure. But if you slip and lose grip on the bleed valve, pressure will build up almost instantly and the boiler will explode, killing you.

It's generally a sign of a plane entering the *transonic* regime (e.g. Ma 0.7 to 0.9), but while it's an indication that a plane is certainly traveling fast, it's not necessarily evidence that they've actually hit Ma 1.0 or higher.",

The vapor cone formed by the large object traveling at a high speed is a byproduct of the shock wave created by the object traveling so fast relative to Earth's rotational velocity (the \"vapor cone\") and the expansion of the air (the condensation of the vapor).  >When the object is traveling at high speed, it is experiencing a tremendous amount of turbulence.  The turbulence is caused by the massive air pressure being generated by the enormous object traveling very fast relative (relative to the earth's rotation) and the large air speed differences between the object and the Earth (relative (to the speed of light) making the turbulence very intense.  This turbulence is what causes the vapor cone to form.  It's a phenomenon called the \"transonic regime\".   It is a type of turbulence that occurs in the air when a massive object is moving at a speed of about Mach 1.5.  When a large plane hits this speed, the shock waves and expansion fans caused by this large object are extremely intense, and the vapor cones formed by these waves are extremely small.  So when you see a vapor cloud forming, it isn't necessarily a sign that the plane is traveling very quickly.  Instead, it may be a sign (in the case of a very large object) that the shockwave has reached its maximum and the air is no longer able to withstand the shock.  If you see the vapor cloud, it means that the object has reached a point where it is no more able to hold the air in its cabin, and therefore is no further from the Earth.  In this case, the object breaking through the sound barrier is a large meteorite (or a meteorite, or a meteor, or whatever it is).",

Well, because people are working at the businesses, allowing them to be open - so you are asking 'why is the business open, and closed when it is closed?'   I guess I'm asking 'Why do we have business hours, and weekends?' And the answer to that is that people want to do group activities in their non-work times - sports, religious services etc - that require everyone to be available, and if people all worked different hours, then at any random time, half of society would always be working and so be unavailable. That is why labour movements forced in laws enshrining weekends and relatively fixed working hours.    Also, why do most places like the DMV, The Bank, etc are only open during the week?  I know that most people work during the day, but I'm not sure why they're not open on the weekend.  I'm guessing it's because most people don't have flexible schedules, and they're just not used to being on call during the weekend?   Or maybe it's just that most places are not open during weekends, so they're more convenient for people to get to and from work on the weekends?",

    "answer": "Fundamental conceptually innaccurate understanding of light. Light has no speed.  If youre reading a blank book, but letters appear on the page as soon as you turn the page and can see them. Do they have a speed?  They appear at the speed you turn the page, not of their own innate properties. This is not a 'speed' but a characteristic defined by something else.    ELI5; Light doesnt move. It exists everywhere along its path as soon as its created. What you call speed of light, is the maximum speed we can change something in the universe. The speed of causality.  Because light exists everywhere along its path, theres nothing to slow down. Thats your answer.      ELI15; This is a fundamental conceptual misunderstanding. All the documentaries, science books etc would do well to change \"speed of light\" to \"speed of causality\" per Einstein.  Light does not travel in the sense we think about.  Light exists in a line along its path immediately upon being created.  When someone says light speed is X, what they mean is the speed of causality is X. The speed at which anything can experience a change in information.  So you might say? Well, isnt that the same? No, because light exists immediately along a trajectory, it doesnt have a mass to slow down. It isn't moving like how we innately understand movement.  Counter to this is light slowing in a medium. Dont be confused. 2 different mediums are being discussed. One medium actually slows causality. The other medium does not slow causality.  1. Light appears slower in a gravity well, this is a type of medium. This is because causality slows. The rate at which our reality can experience a change in data slows.  2.  Light appears to slow in a crystal or other object, because it physically interacts, is absorbed, re-emitted. Basically bounces around causing it to \"appear slowed\" . This is a different kind of medium. The reaction at the quantum level results in the added time not light traveling.",

      "Thanks for the answer!   I have a follow up question though, which is:    >1. Light has no speed.   This is a fundamental conceptual misunderstanding. Light does not travel in the sense we think about. It exists everywhere along its path as soon as its created.  So if light travels in a straight line, it has no velocity.  If light travels as a single particle, it would have a velocity of 0.1. If light moves in a vacuum, it will have a speed of 0..1.  This means that the speed of light is determined by the vacuum in which it is moving at, not by the speed it moves through.  The vacuum in space is the speed at which anything can experience a change in information.  2. The rate at which our reality can experience change in data slows. This is because causality slows.  In other words, the speed that we experience change is determined at the level of the medium in which the change occurs.  I think this is the key difference between the two concepts.  >2. The speed of causality is determined in the medium of change.  When someone says light speed is X, what they mean is the maximum speed we can change something in the universe.  But if we change the medium, then the change in causality will be at the same rate as the change of light.  Is this correct?",

How are they not just completely filled with dust?",

I meant, if light travels at a constant rate, how does it know that it is travelling at a certain rate, and therefore can't be affected by any change in that speed?

      "This is a very good explanation. Thank you. So if light travels at a constant rate, it stops being a particle, and therefore no longer has any energy to slow down?  So if we have a particle in our universe that has energy, then the speed of light would be constant?",

    "question": "ELI5: How bad actually are the long term effects of alcohol, marijuana and acid for example, on younger people?",
    "answer": "Drugs damage you mainly on two fronts.  Alcohol is dangerous, because it destroys your body. It is a highly potent toxin and in the process of removing it the body hurts itself. Not as much as you would notice, but over years of constant use, everybody can see the difference to a non-drinker. So alcohol basically decays you slowly.   For the specific scenario of drinking every couple of months it will probably take a lot of time until noticeable defects show themselves, but you will be at higher risk for things like liver failure, than someone who doesn't drink.  Acid or LSD is a psychoactive drug. It is heavily dependent on the psyche of the user, to what happens after consuming it. It may be depicted as one of the more harmless drugs, but that appearance is deceptive. Any psychoactive drug and especially LSD has the potential to cause a psychosis any time you consume it.  So if someone, especially with a developing brain would take LSD, even if it only were every couple of months, that development could be stunted and will be influenced. A higher chance for a permanent psychosis is guaranteed here.   Cannabis is the mixed bag of drugs and widely inconsistent, not only the drug itself, but also how it is consumed.  You can eat, smoke or inhale it, and with pure THC you have even more possibilities. Todays Cannabis also has hundreds if not thousands of different strains that all vary in in drug composition and strength. There are hundreds of cannabinoids in cannabis and they all interact and influence the trip.  So first we have the way to consume it. A vaporizer is the safest way, since it allows you to release the cannabinoids without burning the Cannabis and releasing harmful smoke and byproducts. Then you have eating, where your body has the chance to clean out anything it doesn't want in there, but you consume the whole plant. Lastly smoking fills your lung with additional toxins and kills your bronchi.  Then the drug itself has the same potential of any psychoactive drug to cause psychosis. Cannabis itself has been shown to impact short-term memory and especially trigger underlying conditions of schizophrenia., especially in developing brians.  For your scenario, you would notice differences between someone who never smoked and someone who consumed Cannabis. The damages to short-term memory are permanent and will stunt the development of the brain.  &#x200B;  Lastly, it has to be said that drugs are never safe. You can safely trip on acid ten times and then take a lower dose the eleventh time and still have negative side effects. Our body is far too complicated and these drugs have a tremendous impact on our whole body chemistry every time we consume them, to reliably say what they would cause every time.",

I'm not saying we should outlaw R&Ds because it will stop people from being alcoholics, but we should make sure that it doesn't lead to people just stopping trying to keep up with society.  If we do that, we will have more people working in service jobs, and less people going to R&T.  This would also drive people away from rural areas into cities, as the jobs require lab space.  Also, if we do away with R&DL, we would have more jobs in the service sector, and more people in the manufacturing sector.

    "answer": "Your digestive tract is essentially a tube going through your body. It's where elements from outside of your body have an opportunity to go inside your body. A strong digestive tract prevents this.  Between the cells that line your intestines, you have something called tight-junction. When your tight-junction become damaged, they allow gaps to form between the cells of your intestines.  Then, bacteria and molecules from foods that you eat can enter into your bloodstream, which will cause a heightened immune-state.  Your immune system starts attacking a lot more things because it's always on high alert because of potential toxins floating around in your bloodstream.   I used to have bad pollen allergies. Watery eyes and constant sneezing. It last for a few years. Then one year I started intermittent and long-term fasting. I stopped having allergies that year.  Then I switched to a keto diet, and remain unaffected by pollen. But if I start eating a lot of junk food and crap during allergy season, my eyes start itching again .  Certain foods damage the tight junction in your digestive tract. You can test the permeability of your intestines with the PEG400 test. You drink a solution, and then find out how many particles from that solution end up in your pee.

I think I phrased my question poorly. I meant that we need more energy to make water purify.  But I meant, we don't need more electricity to make drinking water. We need more solar energy to produce electricity.  So if we're going to make more electricity, we're gonna need more renewable energy.  And that's not just a water issue.  There are other energy issues as well. For example, solar panels are a huge expense. They need to be built at a rate of 5kw/m^3. If we built solar panels at the rate that we use solar, we'd need to build a solar farm every year.  If we build a nuclear farm at the same rate that our solar farm is running, we'll need to burn more energy. And if we build solar farms at the speed that our farm is operating, we will need to run out of energy.",

I'm not saying that we need to spend more money on water treatment plants, just that we're using more energy to produce water.  I think the question is more about how much energy is needed to make water purify.  If we're going to make drinking water from wastewater more renewable, we need more energy.  For example, if we were to build a solar farm that could produce solar panels, we'd need more solar panels than the existing solar farm.  And if we built a solar plant that could generate electricity from solar panels that could convert solar energy into electricity, we would need more electricity than the current solar panels.  So, if you're talking about solar panels and wind turbines, how much would it cost to build one that could make electricity from recycled water?  I don't know, I'm just saying that it would be more expensive than building a solar panel farm that would produce electricity from the recycled water.",

I'm not saying that water is renewable, just that we need to use less energy to produce it.   For example, if we were to build a solar farm that could produce solar panels, we'd need a lot more energy than we currently use.  Also, if you were to invest in a solar panel farm that would produce solar energy at the same rate that we use today, you'd need to invest a lot in solar panels to make it sustainable.  And of course, that also applies to a lot, other environmental concerns as well.  For instance, if I were to design a solar park that could generate solar panels at the rate that our current farm produces, I'd need solar panels that could be as powerful as the ones that are currently being built.  So, in other words, we need more solar panels than we need.  I think that's the key here.  The other thing is that we're fouling nature. We're polluting the environment more and more every day. We are polluting more and polluting with things like pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides. We have been doing this for thousands of years and it's only gotten worse. We need to stop.  We need a new paradigm.  If we want to live in a world where we don't pollute the environment, we have to change our behavior.  That's what I'm talking about.  In the US, we're basically killing off the native flora and fauna. We've been doing that for thousands and thousands of thousands of millions of years. We don't have a plan to stop it, we just have a new one that doesn't work.  It's called \"carbon capture and storage\".  We're basically just using more and using more energy to store and process the same amount of energy that we already use.",

There is of course limits to this right and journalists can not be part of a crime or in a possition where they can prevent the crime from taking place. There may also be more specific laws depending on the legislation.  It does not mean that it is easy for journalists to find criminals to interview.  There is a reason wanted criminals have not been caught. So a journalist might need some time to gain the confidence of the criminal networks they are making a story about. Investigative journalism takes a lot of time because of things like this. You might even see the journalist having to publish whatever they have and first then start to gain the confidence of the people higher up. Trust also goes both ways and the journalist have to make sure that the criminals are who they say they are and that they will not do harm to them. Journalists have been kidnapped or even killed when investigating criminals they trusted. It is also common for journalists to get a lot of information that they can not publish yet because it would be unfair to the criminals involved. So an article or a documentary might have to sit on the shelf for months or even years before it can be published. In order for the criminals to be able to trust the journalist there can not be any information published that the police find useful. Even if there is some useful pieces of information to the police they can not trust that it is accurate since it may be embelished or distorted information at that point.",

    "answer": "They call this condition \"honeybound\"  Queens need open cells to lay eggs... If a colony becomes too cramped in their hive they will create a new set of queens and all the oldest bees and the old queen fly away to start a new hive in some other new space.. the young bees remain behind taking care of the new queens and new baby bees... the new queens have fatal duels until only one remains... typically if the first queen to emerge is healthy she will be allowed to go kill the other queens  before they escape their cocoons... if the best queen is slow to emerge workers will protect that area from a lesser but quicker to emerge queen who would certainly eliminate that better competition given the opportunity.  If the space is extremely cramped or the colony exceptionally populous, they may also send a couple more swarms with newly emerged queens rather than having them duel down to one...  Ideally the best new queen takes the original colony... the old queen starts up a new hive elsewhere... if they're especially fortunate 2-3 minor swarms with new queens also begin anew.  Those minor swarms do not have great odds of survival but sometimes nature finds a way.  Update: thanks so much for all the gifts and goofy comments you all made my day = )  I've only been a bee keeper for a single season, but I take that responsibility seriously so I've tried my best to learn as much as I can so I can be a proper steward of my lil beebies.

The queen has to lay eggs in a special place called a honeycomb.  The honey is stored in a jar that's attached to the hive.  When there's too much honey, the jar will overflow and the bees will die.  This happens when there's a lot of honey in a hive but there's no one to collect it.  If there's not enough honey, they'll die.",

My grandparents had a landline phone number and address for DECADES!  So getting a reliable database that didn't have to deal with many recent changes wasn't that big of a problem.    My wife's family has a different phone number, but her grandparents had the same landline for over 50 years.  So the database was able to handle that.  But the phone service changed.  And that's where the problem lies.  The phone company has to deal w/changes in phone numbers, and that's not something they can easily deal with.  They're not going to do it overnight.  It's not like they can just call you up and say \"hey, I've got a new number, can you give me your old one?\"  It takes a lot of effort to keep a database updated.  Like, a lot.",

The SCOTUS allowed reasonable restrictions on abortions in Casey, and many states have been pushing the limit on what is 'reasonable.'  The Texas legislature passed the most restrictive bill in recent memory. Abortions after 6 weeks are basically forbidden, which means that almost all women will be too far along for an abortion by the time they realize they are pregnant.  Historically, the SCOTUS has struck down laws like this that were overly restrictive, but in this case (in a 5-4 decision) the decided reject an emergency injunction - meaning the law is in effect until the larger case is heard.

The decision is not about whether Texas can get an abortion after the procedure is performed, but whether it can get it done at all.  If the law were to stay in place, it would mean that Texas would be able to perform abortions up to 20 weeks after the pregnancy is viable.  And that's the point.

A cult is a religious organization based on control, who uses that control to remove negative influence about the cult towards the members to exert control over the belief system and remove rational thought about it.  Normal beliefs have a cycle to their creation:  1.  Idea - what is the thesis?  2.  Positive reinforcement - what are all the thoughts that support the idea?  3. Negative reinforcement - what are all the things that go against the thesis and make it not true?  4.  Reflection - weighing the positive against the negative in reflective thought  5.  Belief - what is your conclusion after considering the thesis from other angles and hearing from multiple perspectives on the issue.   Cults remove #3 and because of that you have no negative reinforcement. No negative and there is only positive going into reflection. So you get a fast track to belief.

    "answer": "The medical industry, and specifically the medical insurance industry is very heavily regulated.  Also the US norm of having insurance tied to your job creates problems.  A solution would be to decouple insurance from employment.  If your employer provides benefits, there\u2019s a \u201ctotal compensation\u201d number somewhere on the books.  Like if your salary is 50k plus benefits, it\u2019s likely costing the company 75k to employ you.  Instead of the company providing insurance, if the compensation became just pay you 75k, but no benefits, with a more open market option for health insurance, like there is for home or auto insurance, more options could emerge.  You\u2019re someone young and healthy with no kids? Sure, here\u2019s a plan that is dirt cheap, but doesn\u2019t cover much beyond catastrophic accidents/illness.  You\u2019re married and have 3 kids? Here\u2019s a plan that costs a bit more and covers more.  You\u2019re a hypochondriac that\u2019s constantly convinced you\u2019re dying?  Here\u2019s a plan that covers everything imaginable, but you\u2019re going to have to pay a lot for it.  Another option is tort reform for lawsuits.  High risk medical fields like OB, surgeons, etc have to carry enormous levels of malpractice insurance and liability.  If they\u2019re in private practice, premiums can run into the 6 figures.  This decreases the amount of people willing to assume that level of risk, meaning shortages.  Any time there\u2019s a shortage, price goes up.  So reducing the ability to sue a doctor for millions of dollars for something that isn\u2019t blatantly their incompetence (like an injury to mom or baby when giving birth, even if all protocols and good practices were followed) could help too, because then there\u2019d be lower risk to such fields and more people would want to go into them, meaning wait times and price could go down.",

The company can then choose to not provide you with health insurance, or you can get a policy that covers you for a year and then decide whether you want to renew.   This is a very bad idea, and it's not something I'm advocating for.  I think the US should look at things like this:    What if the company you work at is not required to provide health insurance?  What would happen if you were fired for some reason?   Or if you're not working for a company that provides health insurance but you're still required to have health insurance because you're a worker?  I don't think that's fair, and I think it's a bad idea for the economy in general.  What about the people who are not working at a company? What if they're not getting health insurance at all?

So if your company provides health benefits, but doesn\u2019ts pay you for the services you provide, you can choose not have them.  Or you can get a policy that pays you for your services, but also includes benefits.  I think this is the best answer.  The other thing I\u2019m thinking about is tort reform.  If you can sue your doctor, you could probably get a lot of money back. But if not, you still owe the doctor millions of dollars.  And that\u2019d be a lot to pay off.

If you're a small business owner, you can't just walk away from your job and get a job anywhere else.  You're stuck paying a company a monthly premium that doesn\u2019t cover you.  And you're also stuck with the company policy because you're either a small businessman or a professional.  It's a Catch 22.  There's no single solution.  One solution would be to decouple insurance from employment.  Like if your salary is 50k plus benefits, it's likely costing the company 75k to employ you. But if you're in a job that pays you say, say $50k a month, but offers no benefits, you'd be stuck with that company policy.  Or if you are in a company where you're guaranteed a certain number of years of service, but the company can't offer you more than that, you'll be stuck paying the same amount.  That's a no matter what.  Another solution would to allow small businesses to go it alone.  Companies that offer health benefits can go it's own way, but if they do, they're still tied to a company.  What's the benefit of doing it on your own?  Well, you get a small percentage of the revenue that you're generating.  But you're no longer guaranteed a job.  In theory, you could go into a small company that offers health insurance and not be tied to any employer.",

      "Thanks for your response!  I think the US healthcare system is pretty screwed up.  I\u2019m not advocating that everyone stop going to doctors, just that they be regulated more.   I know that there are some good doctors out there, but I\u2018m not convinced they\u2019re worth the money.  Also, I\u201dm not a doctor, but my family has been in the medical field for over 30 years and I\u201eve had a lot of bad experiences.  If the US government were to do things differently, I think more people would go into the medical fields, and the cost of care would go down.",

They treat the patient, send them an outrageous bill and, because it\u2019s outrageous and affects credit they don\u2019t have anyway, they let it lapse. To offset this, hospitals jack up prices to have insurance or more economically stable citizens cover the difference.. except as prices get higher, insurance gets higher and the amount of people that can afford the bills get smaller. More people fall into the category that can\u2019t pay the hospital bill. So, to cover the difference, prices go up, insurance goes up, and the amount of defaulted medical bills go up.   Rinse lather repeat.  And this is why it costs $1500 just to go into the ER. Then they star giving you $800 saline bags for hydration, $500 Tylenol, $200 for the bandaid after they drew blood. You\u2019ll get the $700 lab work bill separately. A doctor walked past you once so that\u2019s $500. You paying that $3200 bill that didn\u2019t actually treat you?

They just have a shorter life span.  The reason why is because they are so abundant.  If you have a live oak in the wild, it will probably die within 30-50 years.  This happens because of the amount of sunlight and nutrients that are available. If you take a dead tree and put it in a desert, it won't have enough sunlight to survive.  So it will die.

If your eyes were to move left, you'd notice a slight jiggling of your left leg, but if you move your left arm, you won't feel it.

The reason why is because your brain is trying to adjust to the lack of saccadic movements. If your eyes are used to tracking points with your fingers, your brain starts to adjust the way your fingers move to compensate for the lack in the correct way.

      "Thank you for the answer! I was about to ask another question, but this one is a bit more specific.    I have a friend who has a very severe case of Saccadic Disruption. When she looks at something, her eyes automatically go to the right, even though her brain knows that's not where they should be. This is because her brain is working on the opposite side of her body, and the way her eyes work is affected by the way our bodies work. When her eyes are on something, they unconsciously move to the left, even when her brain doesn't know it. This happens when she's trying to focus on something. When this happens, her brain starts working on a different side of the body, trying to figure out what's happening. This process is called synchronicity, and it's what causes the saccadic and non-saccadic movements.  When you're having a bad time with saccades, you can try to do something like this: Sit down, put your hands on the table, and slowly move your eyes to the side (not looking at the ground). Now move your hands back to the table and slowly put them back to where they were before. This will help you get used to the feeling of having your eyes moving away from you.  If you're not having any luck with this, try this:  *Hold your eyes as far right as you can with your eyes, then while holding your eyes in place, move your head to the opposite direction.*  * * *  *   ** * * >If you want to simulate the smoothness of a non-Saccadic movement, SIT DOWN FIRST (this can make people very dizzy), turn your head all the way to the back, look as far left as you could with your fingers, then turn your eyes back to your left.  *If you're doing this, you're going to notice that your eyes are moving away. This isn't normal. Your eyes are trying to find a way to find the object you're looking for. If you don't notice it, you'll be able to do it again. If your eyes stay as far away as they can be and you won't track points with sacciades so the movement should be very smooth.  >Imagine if you felt that every time you moved your eyes. Imagine if you couldn't feel that every single time you looked your eyes   > Imagine if I felt that   The queasiness you may experience should demonstrate why saccadian suppression is a necessary thing.",

Humans have evolved a lot of amazing adaptations to keep us alive, and I think we have surpassed what was possible before.  I think the best example of this is the game of hide and seek.  In this game, the hunter hides in a cave and the prey runs out to find him, and the hunter just has to keep running.  This is a very effective strategy for surviving for hundreds of years.  If you have a dog, you can probably outwit them by just running at them, and they will probably just run away.  But if you have an elephant, you have to run at least 100 yards to catch it.

    "question": "ELI5: Why do we need so much ram in cell phones?",
    "answer": "Computers actually use a lot more memory than just their RAM. They also set aside a portion of your disk drive(s) called a \"swap file\". If something happens and RAM gets a little low, the OS finds some portions of RAM that haven't been used lately and transfers them to the \"swap file\". That frees up RAM for what it was doing. Disks are a LOT slower than RAM, so that's why an overloaded computer gets visibly slower: it can be in a state where EVERYTHING involves moving something to or from the swap file. So long as you don't run out of disk space, you can at least run with diminished performance.  (My laptop has 16GB of RAM. It's using 12.3 of it. I'm also using 32MB of swap file, which means I'm doing pretty well right now!)  Phones don't have big disk drives to lean on for swap files. It's only recently that they've had more than about 32GB of storage to work with. If they used some of that storage for swap files, people would be mad that they can't store as many photos, apps, or songs on their phones. Further, the kind of memory they use for their \"disks\" can actually wear out if you write data to it too much. That can take years on modern devices, but it'd be a lot faster if a swap file was constantly writing to the storage!  What happens when a phone runs out of RAM then? Well, the app said it needed some memory to do something and there's no memory. So it can't do anything. If you think about it, it can't even show you an error message! To show you an error message, it'd have to get some memory to store the message. But the phone just told it there IS no memory! So the app crashes. The phone OS tries to deal with this by closing apps you've put in the background. (This is also why having 2 apps open at once is such a restricted feature that took so long to arrive.) It hopes if you haven't looked at some app in a month you won't mind if it takes longer to start up next time.   So the best solution is to put more RAM in the phone. That means not just that the phone can run bigger things, it means it can run *more* things without having to force apps to quit. That also means phones need more RAM to do the same things as PCs.",

The phone OS tries to deal with this by closing apps you've put in the background.  But if you have multiple apps running simultaneously, it can still do whatever it wants.  And if you don't have any apps running, it still can't tell you there's a problem.  So it's basically just a case of \"there's no RAM\", and it's up to you to figure out what's going to happen next.  With more RAM, it's not just that the phone can run bigger things, it means it can run *more* things without having to force apps to quit, and it also means that apps can run in the foreground without having the option to be able to be disabled.  That's why I'm always amazed at how many apps I've downloaded on my phone that don't actually do anything, and why I've never had to force them off.  They're just so damn convenient.",

    "question": "ELI5: what is a non-linear partial differential equation?",
    "answer": "Since I have no idea what your level of background knowledge is, I\u2019m going to just break down the whole phrase.  Let\u2019s start with *differential equation*.  \u201cDifferential\u201d is calculus-speak for \u201cchange\u201d, or \u201crate of change\u201d.  A *differential equation* is an equation, or a math statement, that tells you how fast something is changing, in terms of other things. A classic example is unrestrained bacterial cell division. Given sufficient space and resources, every bacteria cell can divide into 2 new cells each \u201ccycle\u201d (t). So if we have 2 cells, we gain +2 cells each cycle. If we have 10 cells, we gain +10 cells. In general, if we have *Y* cells, then we gain *Y* cells every cycle. In calculus speak:  > dY / dt = Y  where dY / dt means \u201chow fast Y is changing each cycle (t). This is also called a *derivative* or a *differential*, making this a *differential equation*.  What about a *Partial* differential equation?  The \u201cpartial\u201d means that there is more than 1 other variable that is going to affect things. In the above example, we only cared about how many bacteria would grow *per cycle*, or per unit of time. In calculus speak: we took the derivative of Y *with respect to* time (or \u201ccycle\u201d). What if the bacteria were growing along a wall, and bacteria at one end of the wall had more food and could grow faster than those at the other end of the wall? Now Y, the number of bacteria, depends not only on how much time has passed (t), but what position along the wall we are (x). So, we can take the *partial* derivative \u2202Y/\u2202t, but we *also* need to take the partial derivative \u2202Y/\u2202x to get the whole picture. ~~Note, these \u201cd\u201ds are usually lowercase Greek deltas when referring to partial derivatives.~~  Finally, *non-linear* refers to the exponents in the equation itself. \u201cLinear\u201d means variables are only raised to the first power and aren\u2019t multiplied together. Our first example was linear, because the right side of the equation only has Y raised to the first power. If the number of bacteria along this wall changes by the *square* of the number of bacteria for each incremental step along the wall, we have  > \u2202Y/\u2202x = Y^2  Which is a nonlinear partial differential equation.  EDIT: made some corrections based on comment below by u/angrious, including updating the partial derivative symbol to the correct one and changing the final equation to actually be non-linear.",

This is also called a *derivative* or a differentials, making this a differentIAL equation.\u201d    >What about a differential equation that is more than 1 other variable that is going to affect things.   For example, suppose we have a series of cells, each with a unique number of cells (say 10 cells).   Suppose we have an equation that tells us how fast each cell is dividing, and that equation is a differential.  Suppose that we took the derivative of Y with respect to time (or \u201ccycle\u201d). What if the bacteria were growing along a wall, and bacteria at one end of the wall had more food and could grow faster than those at the other end of wall?  Now Y, the number of bacteria, depends not only on how much time has passed (t), but what position along the wall we are (x). So we can take the derivative \u2202Y/\u2202t to get the whole picture.  Now, if we take the differential equation and add in the number *of* cells, we get the differential differential equation \u2202DY/Dt = *Y^2   Now that we have the differential, we can see that the difference between the two values is the *total* change in the cell number, and not the *partial* change.  So if we have 10 cells, and a wall of 1 meter, and 1 meter x, we gain 10 cells each cycle.  If we have 100 cells, then we gain 100 cells each time we go through the wall.

      "Thanks for the explanation!  I was stuck at the end of the equation, so I'm going to try to go back and look at it again.  I'm not sure if I understand it right, but the differential equation is the product of the changes in the variables (dY/dt) and the rate of change (t).   So if I take the derivative of Y and add in the rate that Y is changing, then the change is the same as the change in the number of cells (dT).  So the difference between the two is the rate at which Y is growing, not the change of the number cells.    I don't understand what you mean by the term differential equation, but I'm trying to understand it better.  So, if I have a constant Y and a constant T, and a number of different cells growing along a wall, then I can take the *total* derivative of T and add it to the *partial* derivative  of Y.

I think the biggest difference between the live and on-demand versions is that the live shows are usually much more live, and the on-delivery versions are usually more edited.  Also, the live feeds are usually not distributed across multiple cameras, so it's not like they're all on the same channel.  So if you have a live event at a certain venue, you can probably get the same footage from multiple cameras.  But if you're not, you're probably going to have a lot of different angles.  And if you don't have multiple cameras at a venue, it's probably not a big deal.  It's just that you don's have a ton of different cameras. And you don're not really sure what each camera is looking for.  You're just trying to get the best possible look for the audience.  With the live events, you have to work with what you have available.  If you're shooting a sports match, you dont have a choice but to use the cameras you have on hand.  That's because you're limited to what you can get from the cameras. If you can't get the exact angles you need, you'll have to edit it.  The same goes for the replays.  They're not all on a single channel, so you have multiple different cameras working at the same time.  Every single camera is on different monitors, and each camera has a different output.  There's a lot that goes into it, and it's a constant learning process.  For example, I've been in a lot different control room environments, and every single one of them has different cameras and different angles, and different lighting.  Each room has different lighting, different lighting schemes, different angles and different types of lighting. And every single room has a completely different set of rules and guidelines.  In the live event room, you basically have to go through the same process over and over again.  Everything has to be in sync, and you have no idea what the rules are.  This is a huge part of the appeal of live sports.  When you're working on a live show, you kind of forget that you're just a small part of a big production team.

    "answer": "The effects of moisture on rocks very much depends on the type of rock. If it's porous like sandstone or limestone then it will become denser from absorbing it and possibly explode if exposed to high heat.  In regards to brittleness, water has very little to do with it as it's based on the strength of the bond between particles in the stone. If there's water soluble minerals then it can definitely weaken it, but those are very rare since water likely had already been through it (at least on earth)  There is a slight effect that water can have on rocks that break concoidally (aka like glass). Water filling any voids in the stone can allow cracks to propagate more easily. This trick is used by flint knappers to make some rocks easier to work with when making arrow heads/knives",
    "follow-up": "> In regards to brittleness, water has very little to do with it   I dunno, I think water often plays a significant role in how brittle rocks are or not. I get where you\u2019re coming from \u2014 the intrinsic factor is to do with atomic bonding in the minerals which make up the rock, and (if sedimentary) the particular medium which cemented it during lithification.   Certain other factors of the environment that the rock finds itself in are also important though. Most obvious would be the pressure and temperature conditions: higher temperatures encourage many deformation and/or transport mechanisms on the atomic scale as they are essentially all temperature dependent (things like Coble creep, grain boundary diffusion, Nabarro\u2013Herring creep, grain rotation etc) which are the ways that solid crystalline materials (like rock) can deform in a ductile manner without fracturing. Higher pressures help confine the rock in all directions, so it\u2019s less likely to rupture/fracture. So as you go deeper in the crust, you get increases in both temperature and pressure until you get about 15 km down and you\u2019re in the brittle-ductil transition zone. Much further and it will only be ductile deformation occurring, no fracturing at all.   The other important factor is water. You are right that water is not going to change the physical properties of the minerals themselves unless it\u2019s a water soluble mineral (and thus gets eroded) or one which can take up water into its crystalline structure. Now, although water does not enter the crystalline structure of other minerals (which is the vast majority of minerals), it generally generally reduces the brittle strength as a result of adsorption: water as a pore fluid decreases the surface energy, promotes crack growth and stress corrosion *without the rock having to reach the critical stress points.*  Having said all that, the exact result of more water being present as a pore fluid will depend on all the factors combined \u2014 what is the type of stress and the rate of stress being applied? What are the temperature and pressure conditions? What type of rock is it and what is its overall porosity and permeability? Is the pore space evenly distributed or very heterogeneous? So it\u2019s definitely not a straightforward question, but I think more often than not, the addition of water increases the amount of brittle deformation going on.",

The reason it's *better* to use the frame/ground (instead of the straight negative terminal), is because there's a very small chance (even smaller in more modern batteries), to ignite hydrogen gas that car batteries can leak (pretty rarely). When connecting to the frame/ground, the spark is further away from the battery which reduces the chance to ignite any hydrogen gas.    tl;dr - Negative to negative is fine and not \"wrong\", it's just less safe than negative to frame/ground (the farther from the battery the better).",

One type of accounting firm does things like pay bills and book invoices and prepare financial statements. It's actually more common for *medium* and smaller firms to use these kinds of accounting firms. Bigger companies often do this work in-house, though they may *centralize* it, so there's one office where all the accounting is done, even when the company has multiple locations.   The other type of accounting firm is an **auditing** firm. Those firms are engaged to *review* a company's existing books and financial statements for accuracy and completeness. They don't actually \"do\" the accounting for a company, but they *certify* that the company's financial statements and reports are correctly stated, not leaving anything out or misrepresenting anything.   When a company has investors, or stockholders, or even has large loans to a bank, those parties (the bank, the stockholders, the investors) want to have assurances that the company's financial reporting is true and accurate, so the company hires 3rd party outside firm to audit and certify their accounting.

    "question": "ELI5: Why do gas prices include the extra 9/10 cent on the end?",
    "answer": "That is an ancient consumer marketing technique. A very long time ago, people in marketing figured out that consumers perceive a price of, say, $1.99 to be significantly less than a price of $2.00. Of course, those prices are not actually very different, but people tend to round down to the nearest significant digit rather than rounding up when they are purchasing consumer goods. The same is true for something like refrigerators: buyers will look at a fridge that costs $1199 and one that costs $1200, and they will express a preference for the slightly cheaper one regardless of any benefits the slightly more expensive one may possess. Psychologically, that $1 difference between 1199 and 1200 is very impactful. Now, let's change the prices of those refrigerators to, say, $1286 and $1288. Now people will look at the two refrigerators and perceive them both as being essentially the same price (which they are) because the significant digit  - 2 - is the same. For that very same reason, both refrigerators could increase in price to $1289, or even $1299, and nobody would even care. If the price creeps to $1300, the significant digit has changed and people start to think they're being hornswoggled.   The 9/10 thing is related to that behavior. Consumers ignore the 9/10 and focus on the pennies because that's the significant digit in a gasoline price. This effectively allows oil companies to charge an extra .9 cents per gallon of gas without you even realizing it.",

      "I think the reason I'm asking is because of the rounding. If you take a $1.99 bottle of gasoline and put it in a calculator, you get a price of $2.49. Now if you take that calculator and add a 1 to the end, you would get a result of $3.49, right? So why would the calculator be recalibrating to reflect the new price?",
      "So if I have a fridge that costs $1199 and a fridge which costs $1200, I can choose the one with the smaller price tag?",
      "Thanks for your response!    I think I understand now why the marketers use the 9/10 to their advantage.   For example, if I bought a $1199 fridge and a $1200 fridge, would I be able to tell the difference between the two?   Or would I have to factor in the fact that the price of both is the same?  I don't know, I'm just a little confused.",
      ">That is an ancient consumer marketing technique. A very long time ago, people in marketing figured out that consumers perceive a price of, say, $1.99 to be significantly less than a price, say $2.00. Of course, those prices are not actually very different, but people tend to round down to the nearest significant digit rather than rounding up when they are purchasing consumer goods.  So, if you had two refrigerators, one was set to cost $1199 and the other would cost $1200. Now, let's say you took the difference between the two prices and added it onto the price of gas. Would the price difference be, say, $1? Or would it be, $2?    The answer to that is, yes. The difference between $1195 and $1200 is psychologically significant.   So if you take the difference in price between the fridge and the gas tank, and add it onto that price, the difference will be, again, psychologically significant, but not enough to cause a price increase.  Why? Because the difference is so small that it doesn't really matter.  If you take a $2 gas tank and add in the extra 9/10, the price will still be the same.  But if you put it on a $3.00 car, the change in price will be negligible because the car is already priced at $3, so it doesn\u2019t matter. Similarly, if we take a similar $2 fridge and put it into a car, and then add in another 9/11, the car will still cost the same, because the price is already set at $2, so the difference isn\u2019ts that significant.",
      ">That is an ancient consumer marketing technique.    Why is it that people perceive a price of a gallon of gas as significantly less than a price in a car?  Because the gas is rounded up to the nearest 9/10 cent?   Because that's what people do when they see the price of gas.  And why is it different for a car and a house?",
      "Why would you want to see the price of gasoline go up by 9 cents instead of down?",
      "Thank you for the response! I was stuck at the $1.99 price for a gallon of gas. Why would the consumer perceive that as significantly less than the actual cost?",
      "That is an ancient consumer marketing technique.   How did it come about?  I remember reading about a company called Mobil that used the 9/10 as a marketing tool.  I thought it was a marketing trick, but I'm not sure.  The reason I ask is because I've seen it used by other companies as well.  For example, if you have a $1 fridge and a $2 fridge, you can put the two in a shopping cart and put the $1 in the cart, and the $2 in the fridge. Now you take the $3 fridge out of the cart and you put the extra $1 into the cash register. Now the cashier will take the extra 9/1000 out of your wallet and give you the $4.50 back.  This is a marketing tactic that has worked for a long time, and I think it's a very good reason why gas prices are so high.  If you take a gallon of regular gasoline and put it in a calculator, you get the same results as if you put in a regular gallon of gasoline.  But if you add a 1 cent to the end, you have the same result as if the price were 0.1.  So why is it that people perceive a price of, say, $1.99 to be significantly less than a price, say $2.49?  Because the 1 cent is meaningless.  It's just a number.  And the reason why people perceive the 1 as meaningless is because they're used to seeing the 1 represented as a constant value.  When you take that 1 out of context, you see the price of gasoline as being the same as it was before.  That's why people don't notice the difference between a regular and premium gas.  They're used the 1 to represent the constant value of the product.  Similarly, if we take a $1000 fridge and put a $1200 fridge in a cart, we see the same price as before. But if we put the 1 in the car and put in the $1000, people will still see the $1200 price as the same.  Why is that?  It turns out that people don\u2019t perceive the price as being constant. They perceive it as a number, and therefore they perceive it to be meaningless. The same is true for something like refrigerators.  Suppose we had two refrigerators that were priced at $1199 and $1299. Now people will look at the two refrigerator and perceive them both as being essentially the same, which they are, because the significant digit  - 2 - is the same    So the price difference between the two is negligible.  Now if we change the prices to $1286 and $1300, people would perceive them as being identical, because they perceive the 2 as the significant number. For that very same reason, both refrigerators could increase in price to $11989, or even $1229, and nobody would even care.  People don't perceive the difference as meaningful because they don't see the 2.  In other words, people don`t perceive a difference as a price.  Marketing is all about creating a false dichotomy.  You can't create a false choice between two prices.  No one would ever perceive a $10 fridge as being more valuable than a $1289 fridge.  Not even if you could make a convincing argument that the $10 price is the reason behind the difference.  Also, people tend to round down to the nearest significant digit rather than rounding up when they are purchasing consumer goods.  Think about it: if you had a $100,000 fridge and $200,000 one. You could buy a $200 fridge. You would still buy the $200 one.  Same thing with a $300,000 refrigerator.  We don't do that.  Our brains don't work that way.  Instead, we use the 1/10 to make a decision.  How do we perceive a number as meaningless?  We use the 9 or 10 as a way to make it feel more valuable.  What is the significance of the 1 or 10?",
      ">That is an ancient consumer marketing technique.  Why is it so effective?  Because it's not actually that different from rounding up the price of something to the nearest significant digit.   For example, if I bought a $1289 fridge and a $1200 fridge, I would look at the two and see that the price difference would be exactly the same. Now, let's change the prices from $1286 and $1288. Now people will look at two refrigerators and perceive them both as being essentially the same price, which they are, because the significant digit  - 2 - is the same    So why would the price increase from $1199 to $1299?   Because the significant number is the opposite of the price change.  So, why would people notice the difference?  It's because the price is different by the significant digits.  And that's why it works.  If I bought two $1198 refrigerators, one would be the same as the other, and I would still buy the one with the smaller price difference.  But if I buy a $1192 fridge, the price would be different because the number of digits is different.  That's because people perceive the price as being the same regardless of the difference in the number.  The same is true for something like refrigerators: buyers will look in a fridge that costs $1195 and one that costs a $1000.  They will look both at the same fridge and decide which one is the better one.  Because they perceive the two as being identical.  In this instance, the significant numbers are the same, so why would they care?  But the reason they don't is because the difference between the two prices is the psychological one. If the price creeps to $1300, the significance of the number is gone, and people start to think they're being hornswoggled.  This is why the price rise in gasoline is so noticeable.  It is because of the psychological effect of the 9/10.  When you see the price on the pump, you see that it's the same for both the regular and premium gas.  You see the difference, but you don't notice it because the amount of change is so small.  Similarly, if you see a $2.99 gallon of gas on the shelf, you don`t notice it.  Same thing with a $1.99 bottle of wine.  People don't see the change because it's just a change in the price.  With a $3.99 liter bottle of rum, you notice the change in price because it has a change of 9/11, but with a bottle of cheap rum it has an increase of 9.99.  Again, this is because people don't perceive the change as significant.  I think this is the underlying reason why the 9\\10 thing works.",

If it's cold then pouring hot water on it will expand one side before the other and that stress inside the glass which might make it crack.  This isn't the case.  The problem is that when the water is hot it expands on the outside of the glass, not inside.  So if you pour hot water inside the window it will just expand again, and that's why it's not a problem.  Also, if you have a really cold car, you might want to check the inside of your car before you try this.  If you have windows that are really deep, you may want to take extra precautions.  I've had a few cars that were completely ice-free and I've tried to open the windows and it's still a problem (not to mention the fact that the water can get in through the cracks and get stuck).

So if you have a phone line that goes from your phone to your computer, the signal will go up the fastest wires, and down the slower ones.  But if you take a phone signal from your computer to your phone, the same signal will travel down both of those wires.  Why is that?

The brain is locked inside a bony skull. All it receives are ambiguous and noisy sensory signals that are only indirectly related to objects in the world.

Visual parts of the brain then sent a signal to predictive parts of the brain, which sent a signal to parts of the brain that feel pain. The feeling of pain was a prediction, and what you noticed was a prediction error. Prediction errors are usually surprising and easily catch attention.

So you have to guess a \\*huge\\* number of potential answers and that takes time...whoever gets a correct guess first gets awarded with some cryptocurrency as a \"thank you\" for their efforts (in proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin).  Suppose I pick a random-ish number, like what's currently on your odometer. Let's say is 69420. My simple/stupid mining problem might be \"Find a number that you can add to 69420 so that the last four digits are 0000\". You can (hopefully) fairly quickly see that there are multiple solutions, and they're not that hard. 580 will work (69420+580=70000), 10580 will work (80000), etc. You can solve this one with middle school algebra, which means a computer can do it basically instantly.  Let's pick a harder problem...start with our random-ish number, but now my mining problem is \"What is the value of that digit of pi?\". So, in our example, what's the 69,420th digit of pi? Assuming you don't have a list of the digits of pi available, the only way to figure that is to actually calculate the 69,420th digit.

    "answer": "Pure math problems can be simple to state but very hard to show that they are true. The problem tends to be general in nature so you can't just test all alternatives  A famous example is Fermat's Last Theorem stated in 1637  It states that a\\^n +b\\^n = c\\^n do not have an integer solution for n >2  Finding a solution of n=1 is trivial because a number to the power of 1 is itself so 1^1+1^1=2^1 => 1+1=2  It is alos easy to find a solution for n=2    3^2+4^2=5^2 => 9+16=15  The problem is now how do you show that there is not a solution for n>2?  If you just test different options you can only show that there is not a solution for the one you have tested. You can test a lot of numbers on a computer but the number you have tested will always be limited.  If you like to test it for a b and n less than 1 billion you start to reach calculation time for a computer longer than the age of the universe. Even if you could do that calculation how do you know there is not a solution when some number are in the trillions?   There is an infinite number of integers so it is impossible to test all alternatives.  So to show the statement is true you need to discover a lot of maths and in 1995 ane 129 pages long proof was published by Andrew Wiles. So it took 358 years until a mathematical proof fo that statement was possible",

I know that it took 358 years, but I was always under the impression that it was fairly easy to prove.   For example, if you have n >2 and you have a problem with 3^2+4^2, how long would it take you to calculate the answer?   If you have the problem solved, how do you know there is not a solution for n>2?  I'm assuming that you can't just take the answer and run it through a calculator.",

      ">If you could do that calculation how do you know there is not a solution when some number are in the trillions?  I think that's a fair question, but I'm not sure how you can prove it. I mean, if you could calculate it in a million years, how would you know it's not a problem?",
      ">If you just test different options you can only show that there is not a solution for the one you have tested.  This is a very good answer.  But how do you prove that there isn't a solution?    I think the problem is that there are infinite numbers of possible solutions.   So how do we prove that the one we have tested is not the one that exists?  I know that there have to be infinite numbers to test, but how do they prove that they are not?  Is there a way to prove that n >2 is not n >1?",
      ">If you just test different options you can only show that there is not a solution for the one you have tested.  This is a very good answer.  But how do you prove that there isn't a solution?   You can't prove that a number to the power of 1 is itself a problem, but you can prove that it is not the power to the next power of one.    So how do we prove that n >2 is not n >1?  We can't show that n>2 is n >3, but we can show that 3^2+4^2=5^2 => 9+16=15   The problem is now how do do we show that it's not a problem for n>3?  The answer is that we can't.  We have to prove that the problem is n>1.  And that's where the problem lies.  If you can't find a solution, then how do the problem lie?  And the answer lies in the fact that there are infinite numbers of possibilities.  So you can test a lot of numbers on a computer but the number you have test will always be limited.  That's why there's no proof for infinite numbers.  You have to find a way to test a finite number of numbers. And that can be very hard.  For example, if you have a problem with a number that is n^2, then you have to test it for a b and n less than 1 billion.  Now if you take that problem and multiply it by a billion, then multiply it again by a million, then take it by another billion, and so on.  The number of possible combinations of n^3 is infinite.  There are infinite ways to test that problem.  It's just that the number of possibilities is finite.  In fact, there are only infinite ways of testing that problem, and there are finite ways of doing that.  Every number can be tested for a finite amount of ways.  Even if you could do that calculation how do it know there isnt a solution when some number are in the trillions?  Because there are no infinite numbers, there is only finite ways to solve a problem.",

The water is absorbed through the eyelash film and then released through the cuticles at the inner corners of the eyelid, where it is absorbed into the lining of the eye, and then flows out through the tear ducts.  This happens when the eyelids are closed, and it is called a \"tear film\".   It is not a physical phenomenon.  It occurs because the tear glands only produce a thin film of liquid that is not able to contain the actual tears.  When the tear is produced, it is not absorbed by any cells in the eyelache, but rather it is pushed through the lining and out the other side of the eyes.  As a result, the tear can escape through the slit in the eye and into the bloodstream, where the water is already flowing.

How much the start of the wave is offset from time 0.  You can sum up any number of different fundamental waves to get a composite signal. You can also de-construct that composite signal into its component waves.  Now, we want to encode a message into our wave. The way we do this is by varying one or more of the amplitude, frequency or phase of the wave.  For example, the most basic form of modulation is Amplitude Modulation - the basis of AM radio. This is an analog system where the changing amplitude of our wave can be read as another wave - a wave that encodes the information we want.

    "answer": "Hello!   Former power lifter competitor, and current world record deadlift holder (for my age group and weight class).   Also am a ACE certified national personal trainer.   First off, I think it\u2019s important to note that there are different types of deadlifting, but between conventional and sumo, deadlifts use %85 of muscles in your body when done correctly.   As already noted above, hips and knees drive the movement, and the load is shared throughout %85 the body (at different times throughout the movement). ~%45 of this should be your core, as it should be engaged the entire lift (many people don\u2019t realize this)!  The part of deadlifts being a compound leg exercise is predominantly the moment between picking up the bar from the ground, and performing the hip hinge. This exercises the hamstrings and quads immensely.   Isometric contractions moreso consist of squeezing your muscle area to \u201cactivate\u201d/warm up your muscle in an area. Ex. Weak glutes when squatting \u2014> isometrics for glutes before squatting.    Happy lifting!",

    "question": "ELI5: how did crocodiles survive the asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs?",
    "answer": "Here's the current understanding of it:  When the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs hit, it smacked into the earth and ejected a bunch of rock, knocking a lot even up into space around earth.  This came falling back down all around the planet, and as it entered the atmosphere it started to heat up from re-entry, heating the air around it as well.  All over the planet, for hours, the sky above was red hot, glowing like an oven....and cooking anything on the surface of the earth...this would have caused massive wildfires as well.  Then, after this deadly pulse of heat, massive amounts of dust in the upper atmosphere would have blotted out the sun, cooling the earth and making it hard for plants to grow.  Only years later did the planet regain some sort of equilibrium, but by this time a mass extinction had wiped out many species and ecosystems were really out of whack.  So what does this have to do with crocodiles?  Well, if we look at patterns of extinction on land, what we see is that basically all the species that survived on land were smaller than about a kilogram...small enough to hide under something and avoid being baked to death during the first stage.    Crocs are much bigger than that, of course...but they live in streams.  _Stream_ life actually had an easier time than purely terrestrial animals.  Not just crocodiles, but turtles and amphibians too.  Why?  For one thing, when the sky turns boiling hot it helps to be able to dive under water.  And while food chains on land mostly depend on green and growing plants to survive,  food chains in streams often depend on detritus falling into streams...leaves fall into streams, bugs break down the leaves, fish eat the bugs, crocs eat the fish.  This means that during the aftermath of the impact, when nearly everything on land was dead or dying, freshwater ecosystems were better able to sort of limp along until things recovered, living on fallen plant matter, etc.  A lot of species still died...but they didn't _all_ die like all the (non avian) dinosaurs did.",

This came falling back down all around the planet   This was the second time it happened, but the first time was when it hit the moon, and the second was when the asteroid hit the sun.  The second time was because of the heat generated by the impact, and because of all the dust coming down, it was much more intense than the first.  And because of this, it took millions of years for the planet to cool down enough for plants and animals to recover.  Only years later did the planet regain some sort of equilibrium, but by this time a mass extinction had wiped out many species and ecosystems were really out of whack.

How hard do you think you'd have to hit that shot not only to \"break\" the formation, but to actually shatter one or more balls?

      "So if we could just break atoms in 2, would it be easier to build a bomb?",
      "I think the question is more about how hard it is to break the formation than how fast it happens. Is it possible to break a nuclear reactor in a way that would not create a huge explosion?",
      ">This breakage happens in nuclear reactors, with a neutron hitting an atom, with the energy of the U-235 and actually splitting the nucleus.    This is what causes the explosion.  The problem is that the nuclear reactor is built to produce electricity, which is why it needs to be turned on and off constantly.  So when the neutron hits the nucleus, it doesn't just create a fire, it also creates a huge amount of heat that can be absorbed by the reactor, which in turn creates a fire that can destroy the reactor.  This happens because the nuclear fusion reaction is a reaction that uses a combination of heat and electricity.  When the nuclear reaction starts, it creates a massive amount of energy that can then be released, which can then heat the reactor up again, creating a huge explosion that can eventually destroy the nuclear core.  But the problem is, how does this energy get released?  The answer is that it's called fusion.  It's a process called nuclear fusion, and it's a bit like breaking a balloon.  Nuclear fusion is a process that takes a while to get going, because it requires a lot of energy to get started.  In the case of nuclear fusion reactors, the energy is stored in the form of the uranium, which then has to be released through the nuclear reactors.  That's why it takes so long to get to full speed.  Also, the nuclear explosion happens in a nuclear reactors because the fusion reactions take so long because the atoms are so small.  They're made of a lot more of uranium than the other materials like glass or steel.  If you can break the atoms in half, you can create a much larger explosion.",
      "But why does it need to be so powerful?",
      "So if I could just smash a bunch of atoms together in 2, it would be enough to destroy the reactor?",
      ">This breakage happens in nuclear reactors, with a neutron hitting an atom,    This is what happens when a nuclear reactor burns uranium.   The nuclear reaction is what causes the explosion.  The explosion happens when the neutron hits the uranium nucleus, causing it to split in two.  This happens when there is a nuclear explosion, and the nuclear reaction takes place in a nuclear fusion reactor.  In a nuclear nuclear reactor, the explosion happens at the nuclear core, which is where the uranium is located.  When the nuclear explosion happens, the nuclear fusion reaction takes about 10 seconds to complete.  After the nuclear reactor has completed its nuclear fusion, it releases a huge amount of energy.  It is this energy that causes the nuclear meltdown.  >This release of energy is what makes nuclear reactors so dangerous.  Nuclear reactors are extremely powerful.  They can destroy a lot of material.  If you have a nuclear power plant with a nuclear core that is more than 10 megawatts, you can probably get a lot more energy from the nuclear reactors.  But if you have one that is less than 10 Megawatts, then you can get the same energy from just one nuclear reactor. The problem is that the nuclear power plants that are smaller than 10 Gigawatts are much more powerful. The energy that is being produced by the nuclear reactions is enough to destroy a nuclear material. If you had a nuclear plant that was much larger, you could probably get the energy from that reactor to destroy the nuclear material in a much smaller amount of time.  Also, the fact that a nuclear reaction requires a lot energy to get going is another problem.  With a nuclear energy reactor that is only about 10 Megawatt, you need a lot to get started.  So if you had one that was about 10 megawatt or less, you would need a nuclear winter.  That is why nuclear reactors are so dangerous, because they need a ton of energy to start.  And that is why they are so incredibly difficult to build.  Because the energy is so incredibly high.  You need a huge number of atoms to build a nuclear weapon.  Even if you could build a bomb that was just a few megawatts in size, it would still take a lot.  Why? Because the amount of atoms is so high.",
      "That makes sense. But what if the neutron is hitting the nucleus instead of breaking it?",

    "answer": "I will preface this wall of text by saying that I am very much in favor of the 2019-2020 protests, so please read this text with that in mind.  British National (Overseas) was a scheme originally implemented in the 80s/90s. As the handover from the UK to the PRC of Hong Kong was being discussed, there was a concern that HKers born in a British colony/territory would be forcibly stripped of protections they had as nominal British subjects. To counteract that, the UK proposed that everyone born in HK prior to a certain date would be eligible to be a BN(O), or British National (Overseas). This would give them some consular protections as a British subject, but not full citizenship rights. The idea was to allow those who did not want to live under the PRC to emigrate as if they were British citizens. Many did, finding homes in other ex-British territories like Australia and Canada. However, the handover agreement promised 50 years of autonomy to the HK government from the PRC, which eased many people's minds about remaining in HK or returning to HK after the handover.  This is being revived now in light of the anti-government/pro-democracy protests that started in 2019. The crackdown by the pro-PRC HK government, culminating in the 2020 National Security Law (NSL) forced by the PRC onto HK, was not favorably received by the UK and other western nations, being seen as a violation of the handover agreement that the UK had signed with the PRC in 1984. The revival of BN(O) is supposed to be a recourse from the UK to HKers; since the PRC isn't allowing HKers the 50 years of autonomy that they owed them, the UK will again extend the offer to emigrate from HK with much loosened restrictions. I am not certain on the details, but the eligibility has been greatly expanded compared to the original BN(O) offer.  The PRC has counteracted by not recognizing these BN(O) documents as travel documents. This is a bit of a hollow move, as most (if not all) HK residents have HK/PRC travel documents. They would simply use HK documents to pass through emigration controls in HK when departing, then use their BN(O) documents to enter the other country.  There are a few cases where someone who has been arrested for participating in the protests or violating the NSL and has had to surrender their HK/PRC travel documents as part of their bail/arrest conditions. These people would be most impacted by the lack of BN(O) recognition, as they would have no valid travel documents. However, since they are on bail, they would most likely be denied boarding/emigration anyway.  It matters now because many of the protests have currently been silenced, both by the NSL and by the pandemic, both in terms of legal restrictions (lockdowns, curfews, public gathering limits/bans) and public health concerns. Since many of those who have protested are unable to do so safely, the next available option for them is to simply emigrate if they no longer want to live under that government.",

Since the handoff, most of those who wanted to emigrated have not been able to do so, and many of them are still stuck in the PRCs.  So the BNs are basically useless.  I'm not sure what the UK's offer is supposed to do, but I'm guessing it's just a PRC thing to do to make it easier for people to get out of the country?",
      ">British National (Overseas) was a scheme originally implemented in the 80s/90s. As the handover from the UK to the PRC of Hong Kong was being discussed, there was a concern that HKers born in a British colony/territory would be forcibly stripped of protections they had as nominal British subjects. To counteract that, the UK proposed that everyone born in HK prior to a certain date would be eligible to be a BN(O), or British National (overseas). This would give them some consular protections as a British subject, but not full citizenship rights.  This was not favorably received by the UK and other western nations, being seen as a violation of the handovers agreement that the UK had signed with the PRF in 1984.  However, the handfees agreement promised 50 years of autonomy to the HK government from the PRB, which eased many people's minds about remaining in HK or returning to HK after the hando. Many did, finding homes in other ex-British territories like Australia and Canada.   The BN (O) was reintroduced in the early 2000s, mainly because of the anti-pro-democracy protests. The crackdown by the pro-PRC HK government, culminating in the 2020 National Security Law (NSL) forced by the PRI onto HK, was not viewed favorably by the western nations.  The UK offered to extend the BN passport to those who wanted to emigrate, but the PRCs were not interested in it.  I'm not certain on the details of the offer, but I'm guessing that the Bn(O) is still a bit of a hollow move.  If the UK does offer it, how would they be able to do it?  I know the BNs(O's) are issued by the British government, but how would the non-PRCs be able get them?   I think the BNI(O)'s would be issued in the future?",
      "Thanks for the response!  I was under the impression that the BN(O) was only offered in the 90s?",
      "What about those who were arrested for participating in the protests? Would they be allowed to leave?",
      "The UK is offering to give BN(O) documents to people who want to emigrate from Hong Kong?",
      "I see, I'm a bit confused on the BN(O) offer. I thought that the UK only offered it to those who were British subjects. I'm not sure what the requirements are for this.",
      "Thank you for the response!  I'm not sure what you mean by \"return to the PRC\".  I was under the impression that they were still allowed to retain some rights under the PRCs.   I am not sure if the BN(O) is a viable option for those who want to return to the mainland.  I understand the intention behind it, but I'm still not sure how it's going to work.  If the BNs are revoked, how will they be accepted in the mainland?    If they are allowed to return, how would they be able to get out of the country?  I know that the British offer to allow them to stay in the country is still in place, but it's not clear if they'll be allowed to leave at all.",
      "So basically it's a return to British citizenship?",
      "This is a very interesting idea.  I'm not sure what the BN(O) is supposed to do.    I've seen some people say that the UK is offering to give them the BNs (O) as a form of asylum.  But I'm wondering if the Bn(O), if it's even legal, if it can be used for anything in the future?"

    "question": "ELI5: Why can't we just make water by smooshing hydrogen and oxygen atoms together?",
    "answer": "We CAN.  Now, it's not very often in nature you come across pure hydrogen and pure oxygen.  But if you do have pure hydrogen and pure oxygen and you put them together in the right ratio, it's very easy to get them to form water.  In fact, it's hard to PREVENT them from forming water.  It's a common 9th grade science experiment, you run electricity through water in a certain way and one electrode has bubbles of pure oxygen forming on it and the other pure hydrogen.  You catch each in their own test-tube. You combine the two.   A very small spark will cause them to smoosh together and form water.  Thing is, sometimes you don't even need a spark, sometimes just the right (or wrong) type of shaking will do the trick.  Now, in the process of forming water a lot of heat is generated, which has the potential to be very damaging.  Also, pure oxygen tends to burn super easy so there's not a lot of pure oxygen around.  And pure hydrogen tends to react with stuff a lot too.  So you don't bump into pure forms of them very often in nature.  And making pure forms of them is relatively difficult and expensive.  **DUE TO REQUESTS - VIDEOS**  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38ULHoKWZag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38ULHoKWZag) \\- an animation of what is going on  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8gE4oZ9FQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j8gE4oZ9FQ) \\- a guy using 2 thumbtacks and a 9 volt battery to do this - but he isn't catching the gas  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV8KbQyF228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV8KbQyF228) \\- a guy mixing O and H in front of a flame, it goes POP and they zoom in on the small droplets of water formed on the inside.

But if you could do that, you would need even more reductions in battery weight or wild battery efficiency and storage    So basically, the problem would be that the plane would need to be smaller than the battery?",
      ">Electric airplanes have long been a great idea and people have tried to make work, but unfortunately, outside of experimental craft, its just not viable yet.  Why?  Because of the weight.   The reason is that the batteries are too heavy.  They are also too large.  The idea is that you can make a plane that can carry more passengers than a plane with a smaller battery.  But the big planes would need even more reductions in battery weight or wild battery efficiency and storage    So, if you could do that, you could make a smaller plane that could carry more people than a bigger plane, but still be as efficient as the bigger planes?   Also, if we could get batteries down an absolute ton in weight, we might see ideas for some smaller planes, like the ones that need a lot of fuel to operate on electric power.  Also if we were to get batteries to a weight of 1 ton, we could see ideas of some smaller plane  that could be as fuel efficient as a jet engine.  I think I understand now why a plane would need a ton of power and a lot more fuel.  If you could get the weight down to 1 ton and the power down to the same weight, you would need to make a lot less planes.  And that would mean more batteries.  So if you were to make an electric plane that was as efficient and as powerful as a prop plane, it would need more batteries than a jet.  That's why a jet plane needs a tonnage of fuel.",
      "Wouldn't that mean that a plane that could only carry one person would need to be much more powerful than a plane with a single battery?",
      "I see, but what about the smaller planes? Would they be able to use the same batteries?",
      "But why not just go for electric jet fuel?",
      "So basically it would be a hybrid of the current jet engines and batteries?",

    "question": "Eli5: Edible plants and fungi. I assume we used to determine if a food was edible by trial and error for most of the past. How would we determine newly discovered food edible today without jeopardizing health or life?",
    "answer": "The same process still applies, many survivalists have it memorized and use it in the field. It's called the Universal Edibility Test. It's a several step process that takes most of the day to accomplish.  First, you seperate out the various parts. You need to test roots, leaves, stems, buds, and flowers independently, because sometimes one part will be poisonous while another isn't.   You give each bit a good smell. Strong and unpleasant odors are usually a bad sign, and if you're in the field you'll just generally discard them without further testing.   You test for contact poisoning by placing a tiny piece on your wrist for just a moment. If it burns, itches, numbs, or breaks into a rash, you just discard it.  Then you boil each bit individually. Test each piece by briefly touching it to your lips, and then waiting 15-30 minutes to see if anything happens. After that, you can take a small piece into your mouth, chew a couple of times, and hold it in your mouth for 15-30 minutes to see if anything happens. If it's bitter or soapy, you just discard it.  If there's no reaction at all, swallow it and wait the rest of the day. If there's no ill effect after several hours, you can assume this part of the plant is edible. Repeat the process for each individual part of the plant. Many plants have both edible and inedible parts to them, so this can take several days.     As far as fungi goes... just don't. If you're in the field and you can't determine the exact species of mushroom you're looking at with 100% accuracy, don't touch it, don't eat it, just leave it alone. There are many kinds of mushrooms that are edible in one circumstance, but poisonous in another. Hen mushrooms are safe, but if they're growing on a conifer or cedar tree, they're poisonous.  There are scientific tests you can do on mushrooms to determine their exact chemical components and identify if any of them are poisonous, or if they combine to create something poisonous, but if you're out in the woods it's a better idea to just leave them alone.",

There are scientific tests you can do on mushrooms to determine their exact chemical components and identify if any of them are poisonous, or if they combine to create something poisonous, but if you're out in the woods it's a better idea to just leave them alone.  For example, if you find a bunch of mushrooms growing on a conifer, but one of the mushrooms is on the ground, you might want to take a step back and look at it from a distance to make sure it's not poisonous. If you do that, you'll be able to tell if it's one of those mushrooms that's poisonous or not.  Also, if there's a particular species of mushroom growing on the same tree, you may want to make a point of not touching it. If it's on a different tree, it's probably not poisonous, and if it is on a particular tree, don's touch it at all.  And if you don't know if it'll harm you, don 't touch it either.  As far as I'm concerned, if I find a dead body in the field, I'll just leave it there and never touch it again.  That's the best I can tell.",

    "answer": "Anthropologists believe they were basically the same as modern humans, provided they were *Homo sapiens sapiens*. They buried their dead, they made art. They enjoyed sex. They had fun with their kids. They were as smart as people today.   There may have been slight facial differences with modern humans but there are a wide range of face shapes with modern humans and they would fit into that range. So like you might see one and while you might not be able to identify them as looking like people of a given ethnicity, you wouldn\u2019t think that no human would look that way. Early modern humans in Europe were dark skinned but blue eyes came along earlier than skin color became the very pale color that exists now, so you might see a blue eyed person with darker skin, an unusual combination today.   One change in the past 10,000 years is teeth. Ancient humans had an edge-to-edge bite. Front teeth, top and bottom, met at the edge. Nowadays almost everyone has the front upper teeth be in front of the lower front teeth, overlapping a bit. But ancient modern humans would use front teeth to bite down on meat and tear pieces off, pulling the incisors into alignment. They also had perfect teeth for the most part, with more muscular jaws, and that would affect their appearance. They wouldn\u2019t have most of the diseases of modern life such as nearsightedness, tooth decay, acne, etc. they lived in small groups so many of the diseases of high density living didn\u2019t exist or seldom happened, like measles, smallpox, sexually transmitted infections, maybe colds and flu.   Archaic Homo sapiens, meaning people pretty far back on that timeline you give, like 100,000-200,000 years ago, might have had more differences in appearance\u2014they\u2019d be more robust, bigger muscles, thicker brow ridges, less prominent chin.

But more importantly, muscles cannot just convert any sort of energy into movement, just like a diesel engine can only use diesel and not steam or wind or electricity. The energy source for muscles is a specific chemical \"fuel\" in your body called ATP, muscles can only use that and nothing else.  However, while the ATP is the energy source, your brain has to control the muscles somehow, and it does that - simplifying here - by sending electric impulses along your nerves. If you touch an electric cable, the electricity will cause havoc with this communications system - your muscles believe that they're given random, frantic orders, and act accordingly.  So, in short - muscle spasm don't happen because of too much energy, but because they recieve random orders.",

      "So if I understand correctly, when I touch my arm, my muscles respond to the electrical impulses by contracting and releasing a chemical reaction that causes my muscles to contract, but when I rub my arm against a wall, my arm doesn't contract?",
      ">First of all, the light does not reach your muscles   It's a misconception that light is the only energy source for muscles.  In fact, there are other energy sources besides ATP.    For example, there is a chemical called glucose that is used to make ATP. The glucose is the energy that our muscles use to make electricity.  However, glucose is only a chemical that exists in the body, and it is only used by the cells in our body to make electrical impulses.  So, the electrical impulses are not the same as the chemical that our body uses to make energy.  The glucose in our blood is the same, but the electrical signals are different.  This is why when we get a shock, our muscles don't respond to the shock, they react to the electrical signal differently.  If you touch an electric cable, the electricity will cause havoc with this communications system - your muscles believe that they're given random orders, and act accordingly.  But if you touch a regular wall, the shock is not caused by the electricity, it's caused by a lack of communication between the electrical cells in your body and the nerves in your brain.  Your brain is the one that makes the electrical messages, and the electrical impulse is the messenger.  Therefore, if you get a severe spasm, it is not because of too much electrical stimulation, but because your brain is not able to make the correct connections between the cells and the nerve.  And if you have a severe case of spasms, it isn't because of the electrical stimulation itself, it happens because of a lack or awareness of the signals that are being sent to your brain, and your brain has to control the muscles somehow, and in this case - simplifying here - by sending electric impulses along your nerves.  It is not the electrical current itself that causes spasms in the first place, it\u2019s the way that the electrical energy is transmitted through the nerves to the muscles. The nerves are the communication channel, and they are the ones that make the electrical connections between cells and nerve. So if you don\u2019t have a good enough connection between the cell and the electric signal, your muscles will not respond to it.  That is why we get spasms when we have a bad night, it doesn\u2019 t happen because the electrical supply is not there.  We get spasming because our brain is unable to make connections between electrical signals and the muscles, and so the muscles don\u2018t respond to them.  Our brain is also the communication system, so the electrical transmission is also a communication channel.  When we get too much stimulation, our brain starts sending signals to our muscles, but it is in a way that is not consistent with the actual electrical signals that our bodies are making.  These signals are not always clear, so it is easy to misunderstand.  Also, if we get enough stimulation, the muscles will respond to these signals, and sometimes they will not.  Sometimes they will respond in a different way than usual, and that is why spasms can occur.  I think I understand now why this is the case, but I am still confused.  Thank you for the explanation!",

    "answer": "It's dry air sucked in from the outside, which is very cold, and very dry (-40 <1% humidity), and when you heat cold dry air, you get warm even dryer air. Depending on the age of the aircraft it is either engine bleed air, or outside air pulled in and compressed, or a mix of the two. Both are very dry. The humidity from people breathing helps moisten the air up and it's more comfortable if the air is recirculated in the cabin as it keeps the air a little more humid.   It's also much lower pressure (Usually equivalent of 6000 to 7000 feet) at cruising altitude inside of the aircraft. Lower pressure reduces the boiling point of water and increases the rate it evaporates. The lower the air pressure, the lower the vapor pressure and the more easily water boils and evaporates. This is why food often has high altitude instructions that require you to cook it longer because the food doesn't get as hot because the boiling point is lower. Water can never get hotter than the boiling point so lower boiling point, lower temp, longer cook.

A solution - not a great one - but a solution that often worked, was to hold the entire machine about 11-18\" above the desk surface and drop it.

Edit: I'm not sure if this is the correct term, but I remember the ST having a lot of problems with expansion. The expansion would push the chips out of socket, and the CPU would jack up the voltage to the board, causing the chips to pop back out again.   This was a common problem with the ST, and it was something that was fixed by removing the PCB from the board and putting the chips back in the socket.  Edit 2:  >It was called the \"Atari St drop test\"  >I remember this one.  The problem was that the ST's logic board was soldered to the motherboard, and when the chips popped out, the connectors would not connect to the PCB.  This is something that happens with all modern electronic devices, but the ST was different.  So the problem was with the solder joints, not the PCB itself.  \"Pertussive Maintenance\" was the answer.  I remember a guy at Intel doing this with the Atari ST.  He would take the ST out of its socket, jack up its voltage, and then drop the PCB onto a desk, and press the keyboard down on the chips.  It worked fine.  But the problem with this method was that it was too small. The chips were too small to fit through the holes.  And the keyboard was too big.  There was no way to depress the keyboard to depress it.  You had to depress all the way down to the bottom of the PCB, and that would damage the PCB and the circuit.  Also, the keyboard is a bit large for this method.  With the ST PCB, you can't depress it all the same way.  Your fingers are too small for that.  That's why it works.",

This was a common problem with the ST's logic boards, too.  The problem was that the solder joints were soldered in place of the PCB, so when the chips were removed, the solder would pull away from the PCB and into the socket, causing the chips to fall back into place.  This would happen when the chip was connected to the motherboard via a simple screwdriver, but when the board was connected via a more complicated screwdriver that had a screwdriver on the back, the chips would pull out of place and the socket would pop back in.  \"Cooling\" and heating would cause the solder to expand, and the chips wouldn't be able to get back in the socket. This is why the ST would sometimes fail.  Edit: I've seen this problem with other devices as well, but I always thought it was the same with the logic boards.  I was wrong.  Edited to fix it",

    "question": "ELI5: Why is it impossible to suck through a straw that's 10.4 meters long?",
    "answer": "The action of sucking does not actually pull on water. Rather, it allows the air on the other end to push by removing the air from the end inside of your mouth.  This means that, since there is only 1 atm of air, you're limited to that much pushing.  As water climbs the tube, gravity pulls it down, generating a pressure to counteract the pushing. This pressure depends solely on the density of water and the height at the top of the water.  So, solving for the density of water, we see that water can only get 10.4 meters above its surface from the action of atmospheric pressure. If the straw goes deeper than the water's surface, then the straw itself can be longer, but the water can only be raised above its surface by that amount.  The formula for hydrostatic pressure is quite straightforward. p = \u03c1 g h  This is the pressure generated by gravity acting on the water, and it is the pressure that counteracts the pressure of air pushing up. Interestingly, the pressure of the air itself can be found using the same formula (although to get an accurate answer you have to modify it with calculus to account for gravity and changes in density).",
    "follow-up": "but what if the straw was thinner, that way as the water goes up, there is less pressure pulling it downwards therefore allows for it to go higher. and would in theory having one end of the straw be at the bottom of the mariana trench, allow the water to be sucked further past the ocean surface as there is more pressure pushing the water up due to the immense amount of water in the ocean?",

The same beans are used for tea, coffee, tea, and tea.  But the process of roasting the beans and grinding the coffee beans is different.  So the same beans can be used for both tea and coffee.  The only difference between the two is the amount of caffeine.  And that's only because the process differs between the beans used for coffee and tea, not the actual coffee itself.  Also, tea is processed differently than coffee. So the process is different for tea and tea as well.  Coffee is also processed differently.  It's not just the way the beans are roasted, but also the way they are processed.  For example, in coffee, the process involves grinding the beans, grinding the sugar, and then grinding the sugars.  This process can vary from one coffee bean to another.  In tea, the grinds are typically the same, but the sugar is different because the sugar content is different from the coffee bean.  With tea, it's the same process.  However, tea has been processed differently, so it's not as processed. So it's probably not as high of a caffeine concentration as coffee.",

    "question": "ELI5: What is human flatulence?",
    "answer": "Not a gastroenterologist, but let's examine the premise and start with some facts in the hopes of getting some serious answers. I think the point of your question lies in fart-transmission being different from fecal transmission. We know well that we can get sick from bacteria/viruses going from poop to another persons mouth and infecting them that way. You're suggesting an airborne transmission of an intestinal illness (I think).  1. The average amount of gas a human produces in a day is roughly 1L (per Google) 2. The average amount of air exhaled in a day is roughly 11,000L.  So from this we know that if a microorganism had to choose spreading via farting which is to say by airborne transmission, that's 11,000 times *less efficient* than just going straight through the lungs. We also know that microorganisms generally infect/attack the place they are released from, so an intestinal infection prefers to attack the intestine which means it needs to be eaten, not inhaled. *It is possible* to get intestinal infections in your lungs and lung infections in your intestines in certain cases but this isn't common, it's not the preferred method of transmission.  We can also assume that most farts are filtered through underwear and pants, which is similar to wearing a face mask, it'll filter out many of the particulates that microorganisms ride on. So let's assume transmission from fart, through clothes, into the lungs is yet further unlikely.  In the end, this doesn't pass the sniff test (...ha), it's just too circuitous to be an intentional transmission route. Much easier for the illness to spread via direct fecal contamination, in fact that's really, really easy.  However, a quick google search gives an affirmative \"Not Completely Impossible\" as there are demonstrated cases of Cholera (an intestinal illness) infecting the lungs of people with immune disorders. In this case, it's most likely a case of dirty-surface fecal contamination being introduced to the lungs via touching the nose/mouth and *inhaling the feces* but still, it's credible.  So \"Not Fully Impossible\" but extremely unlikely unless you have extremely poor hygiene habits and are immunocompromised.",

Much easier for the illness to spread via direct fecal contamination, in fact that's really, really easy.  Thanks for taking the question seriously!  I guess what I've quoted above is one of the things I was curious about. The distinction between flatulence and feces. Can we draw a pretty stable line in the sand between the two, in most cases? Outside of some sort of serious sickness, where flatulence possibly leads to feces (sorry for gross visual), the two are basically in separate bacterial categories as far as I understand (please correct me if I'm wrong).  I know from reading random Reddit threads that many, many people like to sleep in their beds without any clothes. I've always found that idea sort of baffling for hygienic reasons, but then I started to wonder if my confusion/repulsion had any basis in fact. This is sort of the idiosyncratic origin story behind this thread's random question, I guess.  So I started to wonder...if those people are passing gas in bed while sleeping in the nude, are they rolling around in harmful bacteria? If they share their bed with someone else, or if someone else sleeps in that bed later on, would they also be rolling around in harmful bacteria? Would there be a risk of infection?

I don't see how this is a bad thing because it means that people will be able to pay down their debts faster.  But if the Fed were to raise rates, wouldn't that mean that inflation would go down?",
      "So the Fed is trying to slow the flow of cash?",
      ">Inflation means too much money is moving too quickly, chasing after a limited quantity of goods so the price of goods rises.  Is this a fair way to put it?    I think the Fed is trying to slow the flow of cash because they are concerned that inflation will eventually lead to a deflationary spiral in the economy.   If they can slow the rate of inflation, they will eventually raise interest rates enough to bring inflation back down to a level where it is sustainable.  If the Fed raises rates, it means that inflation is going to come back up, which in turn will bring down the cost of goods.  I don't see how this is a bad thing, it's just a matter of time before inflation hits a ceiling and the cost/quality of goods goes back up.  The Fed is just trying to make sure that inflation doesn't get out of control before it can get too high.",
      ">higher rates mean higher mortgage payments for home owners and higher cost borrowing for people who want to borrow money to build things like homes.  Higher rates mean raising mortgage payments, higher cost of borrowing for car loans, higher interest rates for student loans, and higher interest on student loans for people with mortgages.    >Higher rates discourage borrowing so they are slowing the flow of cash and instead encouraging people to pay off their debts which will allow for borrowing in the future when we want to Rev up the economy.  >Banks are allowed to lend out something like 20x the amount of cash they actually have, so when people borrow at low rates, money is basically being created out of nothing and put into the economy chasing after the finite amount of real goods available.  This is a misconception.  Inflation is caused by the demand for goods and services. When the supply of goods is limited, prices rise.  When the demand is high, prices fall.  If the supply is limited and prices fall, the demand will rise again.  So the Fed is raising interest rates to slow the flow and encourage people to spend more.  But if the Fed raises interest rates, it will also raise the cost of goods.  And if the cost rises, it means more people will have to spend money to buy goods and service.  The cost of services rises because the demand of services increases.  Therefore, the cost for services rises.  As a result, the price of services decreases.  Also, the number of goods available decreases because the number and quality of goods decreases. So the demand and supply of services increase.  All of this is happening because people are spending more money than they have.  It's a circular phenomenon.  I think the Fed's goal is to keep inflation at 2% or 3%.   If inflation is 2% then the Fed should raise interest rates.  Otherwise, it should just keep raising rates at 1%.  I don't see how this is a sustainable solution.  Why is it that inflation is so high when the Fed has been raising rates so slowly?   Because inflation is caused when people spend more money.  Because people are just spending more and more money on things that don't actually need to be spent.  They are just using more money to purchase more things.  That's why inflation is bad.",

As you do things on the computer, such as browse Reddit, your computer keeps taking up more memory with every post you click, every photo you view, every link you click.  When that memory becomes more limited, your computer operates more slowly, as it struggles to try to \"find a place to fit more stuff.\"  However, once you restart your computer, most of that memory is wiped clean and you start fresh, so your computer is often faster.

    "question": "ELI5: Can singularities be ever formed from an outsiders perspective?",
    "answer": "A quick note on terminology; the \"singularity\" is the theoretical point right in the centre of a massive object where its density and gravitational field are infinite under current best models. They may exist, or the models may be not quite right (e.g. quantum mechanics may get in the way). Black holes may have singularities at their centre. But black holes don't \"need\" singularities, they are defined by their event horizons.  The \"event horizon\" is the region around a black hole (technically a 2d surface) that makes a black hole special; it is the point where all worldlines (so future paths in spacetime - where things *could* go) of objects in that region end up falling down towards the massive object in the middle (see [this neat set of diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BH-no-escape-1.svg)). In the simple model for a black hole, the event horizon is a distance of 2GM/c^2 from the singularity (where G is the gravitational constant, M the total mass inside the event horizon and c the 'speed of light').  A black hole forms when there is enough mass within a small enough volume so that this distance (2GM/c^(2)) is outside the object. All that mass doesn't have to be concentrated at the singularity, it just has to be within the event horizon distance of it.  At the event horizon, from the perspective of an observer an infinite distance away, time dilation would be infinite. So when observing something fall into a black hole, you can never see the object cross the event horizon, it will just slow down and stop (and you can obviously never see it cross, as the light of it crossing can never reach you).  But locally everything looks normal. From the perspective of an object falling into the black hole, it doesn't notice the event horizon (although they'll be a lot of other stuff going on there - it won't be a friendly place to hang out), it just keeps falling. [This graphic shows this fairly well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gravitational_time_dilation_around_a_black_hole.gif) - on the left you have what things look like from the object's perspective as it falls in. On the right you have the outside observer's view. From the object's point of view, it just falls in as normal.  Of course, *this only applies once the black hole has formed*, so once the event horizon exists. Before then, the time dilation in that region, while significant, wouldn't be infinite. So there would still be time for things to fall in.  Disclaimer; I haven't done the maths (GR maths is notoriously difficult), but I suspect that yes, if you were an infinite distance away, it would take an infinite amount of time for a black hole to form. But if you are an infinite distance away none of that matters - you are too far away. If you are any closer (i.e. a finite distance away), it would take less than an infinite amount of time to form - and so it is possible.  And we know this is possible; black holes exist.",
    "follow-up": "First of all, thank you for your elaborate answer.  I do, or I think I do, know the difference between a  singularity, an event horizon and a black hole. That's why my question asked specifically about *singularities*. I'm not asking if \"black holes exist\" nor if event horizons could form. I do not doubt that at all.  All I'm asking about are singularities. Could they form?  &#x200B;  >Of course, *this only applies once the black hole has formed*, so once the event horizon exists. Before then, the time dilation in that region, while significant, wouldn't be infinite. So there would still be time for things to fall in.  So, you are saying, that when the star collapses the mass WILL, in a certainty, produce a singularity?   Let me show you my reasoning and correct me when I'm wrong (I assume I will be at some point): From a far away observer the black hole forms. Over a very long period it evaporates. In the end, it evaporates down to nothing. [According to this link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/05/20/ask-ethan-what-happens-when-a-black-holes-singularity-evaporates), the black hole cease to exist, the potential singularity is no more**.**    Now, from a perspective of a massive star: I begin to collapse. All the mass gravitates towards my center. Meanwhile, due to gravitational time dilation from GR, my time ticks slower relative to the rest of the universe. My size crosses the Schwarzschild radius, an Event Horizon is now present. However, now I start to loose mass due to Hawking Radiation. From an outsiders point of view, this is very slow, but from my point of view this is getting faster and faster. **Could the singularity form before Black Hole's mass is evaporated?**",

    "question": "Eli5 How do rich people pay little to no taxes on their income?",
    "answer": "in simple terms, the trick is to have as little income as possible compared to your wealth. You only pay taxes on money you have to spend but barely on money you only own.  So you need to make sure that your income is very close to the money you spend in a given year.  The second trick is to only transfer wealth to income where the tax rates are most convenient to do so. When you have vastly more wealth than you need, you can \"plan\" when you take out certain amounts of money.  (e.g. long term investments are generally taxed lower than short term. So if you can \"plan\" to keep your money invested for years, you pay less tax when you sell them compared to buying and selling in the same year)  The third trick is to use shell companies to circumvent individual ownership. Wealth and income are taxed differently for companies than it is for individuals. aka jeff Bezos doesn't own a yacht. Jeff Bezos started a company, took out a loan at a bank (using his Amazon shares as collateral) and then the company buys the yacht. He then \"leases\" or \"rents\" the yacht from his own company.  This accomplishes a few things:  * He doesn't have to pay income taxes on the money used to buy the yacht. * He doesn't directly own the yacht, therefore it's not counted towards his net wealth. (and thus cannot be taxed) * The company has a whole bunch of tax write offs because it barely turns a profit.    * (in simple terms, the trick is to lease the yacht for just more than it costs the company to own/operate it)  \\*EDIT\\*  lease note that this is grossly simplified. It's irrelevant to know all the loopholes yourself. The last trick is to have so much money that you can hire a bunch of family accountants that research and do this for you. You just say \"i want a yacht\" and they will figure out the best way to do it for you.  \\*EDIT 2\\*  The final trick is to hire the lawyers and accountants that created, or create, the rules.

    "answer": "The same reason those other species have instincts. A coincidence of resources, circumstances, and/or sexual selection tendencies that shaped our evolution. i.e. Instincts helped some species survive.  Humans depend on their instincts less presumably because our other non-instinctive tendencies are more effective at causing successful reproduction and survival to reproductive age.  Neurologists argue that mutations in the human brain structure caused larger distances between the more primitive parts of our brain and memory storing areas. This distance that neural impulses need to travel still had to fit in a small skull which caused some cross-over signals to occur. Erroneous associations between things like recalling a memory of a tiger being dangerous and painful and that sharp rock you sat on to be similarly painful may constitute what we call \"creativity\" and enable ideas like using sharp rocks to defend from sharp tigers. This kind of association was not due to logical discourse but an accidental and irrational association of two mildly similar things due to neurons firing incorrectly. This erroneous processing that gave rise to creativity was selected for over and over due to its apparent value in creative problem solving.  So, it might be argued that creative problem solving has been a more effective means of survival, reproduction, and/or survival of young to reproductive age. That being the case, the human genome \"wastes no time\" maintaining instinctive behaviors.",
    "follow-up": "This neurological distance hypothesis is something entirely new for me. Thank you. This makes much sense.  A small caveat: i get the impression that this explanation relies on imagining creativity as an irrational or accidental processing.

Do you think that the conceptualizing creative problem solving in erroneous and accidental terms is essential to your explanation?",

This is a very interesting and well reasoned explanation.  I'm not sure I understand it.  How did we learn to recognize the difference between a sharp rock and a sharp stick?",
      "Thank you for the response!    I'm not sure what you mean by \"brain shortcut\". I'm referring to the fact that our brain uses shortcuts to process information, and that shortcuts can lead to the incorrect or erroneous conclusion.   For example, if you were to recall a memory of a tiger being dangerous and painful and that sharp rock you sat on, be similarly painful may constitute what we call \"creativity\" and enable ideas like using sharp rocks to defend from sharp tigers. This kind of association was not due to logical discourse but an accidental and irrational association of two mildly similar things due to neurons firing incorrectly.  I think it's more likely that the brain shortcut was used by evolution to help us with survival, i.e. to keep us from having to rely on instincts.  If we had a brain shortcut, we would be able to use it more often to solve problems.  However, we don't have a brain hack, so we have to rely upon our instincts to solve our problems.",
      "I think the best explanation for this is that it's a form of \"erroneous\" memory.   For example, if you were to recall a memory of a tiger being dangerous and painful and that sharp rock you sat on, be similarly painful may constitute what we call \"creativity\" and enable ideas like using sharp rocks to defend from sharp tigers. This kind of association was not due to logical discourse but an accidental and irrational association of two mildly similar things due to neurons firing incorrectly.  This erroneous processing that gave rise to creativity was selected for over and over due to its apparent value in creative problem solving.  I think the key to this is the fact that our brain is wired to process information in a way that allows us to interpret it in ways that are both intuitive and logical.  If we could somehow \"train\" our brain to interpret information in ways similar to how we would perceive it in a natural environment, we would be able to solve problems that are otherwise impossible to solve.  The problem is that we don't have that kind of neural bandwidth.  We don't really have a \"brain\" that can process information like that.  Instead, we have a brain that can only process a small amount of information at a time.  And that's where the problem lies.  It's not that we're not able to process the information in our brain, it's that we have limited bandwidth. We don 't have the ability to process it in the same way as other species.  That's why we're able to think in ways we can't.  For instance, we're capable of solving complex mathematical problems, but we can only do so in a very small window of time. That's because of the limited amount of space that our brains have.  In other words, we don 'nt have the bandwidth to process a large amount of data in a short period of time, which is why we can 'train' ourselves to solve complex problems.  So, we can do it in small chunks of time and still get the same results.  But we can also 'train', and that's what we're doing.  Edit: I'm not sure if this is true for all species. I've read that some apes have been taught to fight by their instinct, and some have been shown to be more effective at fighting than others.  Maybe it's just a coincidence of resources, and/or sexual selection tendencies that shaped our evolution.  Or maybe it's more of a cultural trait.",
      ">This erroneous processing that gave rise to creativity was selected for over and over due to its apparent value in creative problem solving.  So, it might be argued that creative problem- solving has been a more effective means of survival, reproduction, and/or survival of young to reproductive age.    I'm not sure how that's true, but I'm guessing that the evolutionary pressures of reproduction and reproduction are more intense than the pressures of learning to think with our instincts.  I think it's safe to say that the urge to think is stronger than the urge for survival.  If we could just stop fighting instinct and just use our minds to think, we'd be much more successful at surviving.",

I'm not sure what you mean by this.  You're saying that the erroneous processing was selected over and repeated due to the fact that it was useful for survival.  But why did it evolve over and above the natural selection of instincts?",
      "Thanks for your response.  I was under the impression that creativity was something that evolved over time, and that it was a byproduct of the brain's natural selection.   I'm not sure if this is the case, but I'm curious.  If it is, why did we evolve it?",

    "question": "ELI5 UK: how are mortgage rates so low?",
    "answer": "Major Central Banks (and the Exchequer) are pumping money into their economies through quantitative easing (QE). This is the Central Bank buying back government bonds from banks and therefore putting cash into the accounts of the banks. And this cash is not earning much when redeposited with the CB or when lent to other banks (near zero and sometimes negative rates).   Banks are therefore literally sitting on funds that they are not earning any money from if they cannot lend it to others. This explains their willingness to lend at very low rates. These loans (it is hoped) goes into productive investment and therefore helps push up economic activity through wage increases and consumption. Unfortunately, this cash also goes into asset purchases like property and the stock market which isn't exactly ideal (rising property prices and share prices leading to asset price \"bubbles\") Ultimately this kind of expansionary policy tends to lead to higher inflation which is what many people are fearing is happening now.   Until the Central Banks dial back this policy either by slowing down (tapering off) QE or by increasing interest rates, this might continue. The problem here is that while tapering and increasing interest dials down inflation pressure (the intended effect) it also risks a large fall in asset prices (housing and stock markets). The problem with rapidly falling asset prices is that this can lead to enormous pressure on banks to dial back quickly on loans (fearing loan defaults) and this becomes a multiplying effect on slowing down the economy (since a lot of economic activity relies on bank credit. This can lead to a condition called stagflation - where prices increase AND economic activity decreases, essentially the worst of both worlds.   Long story short, it is very possible that the Central Banks are willing to accept (hopefully temporary) higher inflation while trying to avoid massive and sudden asset price deflation. This is a very delicate path to take.",
    "follow-up": "Thanks for that clear explanation!  Can Central Banks adjust their deposit rates based on a bank\u2019s loan portfolio?

I think the central banks are trying to keep inflation low, but they are also trying to prevent a massive and sudden asset price deflation.  This is why they are buying bonds, and it is also why they have been raising interest rates.  But if they start to do that, it will lead to higher inflation, and eventually lead to a deflationary spiral.  So, if they want to keep the inflation low and keep the economy growing, they need to do something like increase wages and investment.  If they want the economy to grow, they have to take away the stimulus that is currently being pumped into it.  And if they do that now, it could lead to the collapse of the economy.",

    "question": "ELI5: How can film tape hold so much information?",
    "answer": "As others have mentioned, film is analog which means the color 'data,' is stored physically on each grain of the film. Since these grains are super tiny (far tinier than the pixels on a screen) we can get really high resolutions from them before they start to become blurry.  Also \"tiny memory card,\" vs \"tiny flat frame of film,\" is also not quite a fair comparison since:  * A digital film will be compressed. This means throwing away some of the data/detail in order to save on file size. An uncompressed 4k movie would be hundreds of GB (if not more). There's no such thing as \"compressing,\" film, so we get all the detail captured by the camera basically for free. * An entire IMAX film isn't just a single frame of film. It's a reel about the size of a table which is WAY larger than a memory card. * While a memory card might be made of billions of transistors, each *frame* on a strip is made of billions of grains. Similarly while each transistor can store either a 1 or a 0, we need many 1s and 0s just to represent a single pixel, while a single grain on film can \"store,\" an entire color completely on it's own.  This is of course only scratching the surface, but if you'd like more info I'd be happy to elaborate on anything.",

    "answer": "Iron is the limit because that's the point at which fusion stops producing energy. Beyond Iron-56, fusion consumes energy, rather than producing it. Stars do, at the end of their life, produce heavier elements - but that production actually robs them of the energy needed to hold their massive gravity up. So when that happens, a star is at the point of imminent collapse.  The Sun, specifically, does not make iron because its core is not hot and dense enough. The Sun is currently only hot enough to produce helium from hydrogen. Late in its life, the Sun will partially collapse until its core heats up enough to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen, but the Sun is not large enough to go any further than that.  > Also wouldn't stars make better nuclear reactors than our own nuclear reactors and particle accelerators? So why can't they also make elements with really high atomic numbers, like Oganesson and Fermium?  During their final moments - and in particular during the collisions of neutron stars - they *do* produce very heavy elements (although I don't think it's known whether they produce all the way to 118 or beyond). During the [r-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process), stars run up the line of nuclei that can juuuuust barely take another neutron.

      "Thank you.   I was wondering if variable inductors were used for transmitting, or if they were used exclusively for receiving?    For example, if you have a receiver with two channels, one on each side, and one on the other side, you can adjust the frequency by the inductor.  For a receiver, you would need a variable inductor for both the incoming and outgoing signals.  I'm not se sure if a variable induction was ever a thing   Also, if I remember correctly, a variable capacitor is used for tuning frequency, but that works just the same for incoming and incoming signals.",

It is a flavinoid, and it is a cofactor in the diet, so it is safe to consume.  However, acetone can also damage the brain by interfering with the absorption of vitamins, which is why it is called a flavonoid.  The reason why it does this is because it binds to the beta-carboxylating factor beta-hydroxybutyl group of beta-tocopheryl acetyl-2, which plays a role in the synthesis of beta carboxylates, which are the building blocks of beta cells and beta-lactamins.  This means that acetone and beta carotene bind to beta-Carboxylate, which play a role as well.  When these two compounds bind to each other, they can create a chemical imbalance in the brain that causes the sensation of high, which can lead to confusion and confusion.

    "follow-up": ">how do those electrical signals convert back to a sound  Magnets. Seriously, it's just magnets.  When your voice hits the microphone on your phone, it vibrates a magnet back and forth, and the vibrating magnet ripples the electrons in the phone line.  When the ripples (which travel almost at the speed of light) reach the person on the other end, they go into another magnet. When a magnet connected to wires is vibrated, it ripples the electrons \u2014 and when the rippling electrons touch the magnet on the other side, it vibrates the magnet! It's literally the inverse of how it went in. Yeah, that's right, a speaker is fundamentally *the same exact thing* as a microphone, just built differently to better suit the task.  So, when the magnet in the speaker on your friend's phone vibrates, it moves the air around it, because all moving objects contain momentum that transfers to the molecules around it. And these air movements are sound \u2014 your voice, to be exact.  >that mimics a persons pitch or tone of voice so precisely?  Now, to address this part. If you move the magnet back and forth very quickly at 256 Hz (256 back-and-forths per second) the person on the other end hears a pure C note. Just one note.  Your voice is a complex superposition of a shitton of different pure fundamental frequencies. In other words, your voice is multiple pure notes played at the same time. When you say \"hey dude,\" your vocal cords are producing many individual pure notes that add up to form a much more complex sound. *All* sounds can be broken up into constituent pure notes. This is the concept of the Fourier transform, but you don't need to worry about that.  How do all those notes fit into the phone line at the same time? Well, they just sorta... do. Electrons are *tiny.* Go look up the size of an electron \u2014 yeah, they're really freaking small. Tons of them can fit on a very small wire at the same time. So, each of the sound waves that add up to your voice are simply carried along the wire simultaneously. Imagine if cars were like ghosts, and they could just pass through each other while driving to their destination. That's what electrons are like. It isn't really this simple in reality because of quantum physics, and I'm not qualified to explain that, but for 99% of cases, it just works like that.  And all those constituent waves travel the exact same way as the single pure note dud. The only reason the clarity goes down at all is because some of the electrons bump into shit. As technology gets better, we find ways to keep the electrons from bumping into shit, and we improve the clarity of our phones.

    "answer": "An embryo with one or more extra chromosomes doesn't just get entirely new ones with genes that the average person doesn't have. Rather, one of the chromosomes that we all have a pair of gets an extra copy, so the embryo has three instead of the regular two.   For most chromosomes, if you have three instead of two, it doesn't lead to viable embryo. The child will die either in the uterus, or at a young age. For some chromosomes, the \"damage\" is less severe, and the child will survive, but may have health problems, including often a reduced life expectancy. Down syndrome, for instance, is caused by a *trisomy* (three chromosome copies) of the 21st chromosome (we all have 23 chromosome pairs that scientists have labeled with numbers 1-23).  Down syndrome is always caused by trisomy of the 21st chromosome, but there are other trisomies that are compatible with life and lead to different symptoms, such as trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). The latter is more severe and often results in miscarriage too, but some fetuses do survive.   For sex chromosomes, i.e. X and Y, typical females have a pair, XX, while typical males have two different copies, XY. You can have trisomy of these sex chromosomes too, leading to combinations like XXX, XXY or XYY. These trisomies are often more benign and not always associated with (noticeable) symptoms, to the point where people may live their lives not knowing they have three sex chromosomes until it happens to come up in a genetic test.",

The latter is more severe and often results in miscarriage too, but some fetuses do survive.   Edit: I'm not sure if this is the correct answer, but I'm guessing that the extra chromosome is what causes the extra problems in some cases, not the trisomal defect itself.  Edit 2: I was under the impression that having three extra chromosomes meant that the embryo would have two X chromosomes and two Y chromosomes, so if the embryo has three, then the XY chromosome would be assigned to the opposite sex. I'm now reading that this is incorrect. The embryo has two X and two Z chromosomes, and therefore the XY is assigned to both the XY and XX.  So if the XY has three extra copies, then it must have two different X chromosomes, right?",

    "answer": "Cryptocurrency isn't code. Bitcoin, to simplify, is a pair of numbers that can be found by guessing a random pair of numbers, then operating some lengthy mathematical operation on those numbers to detect a special property. When found, that number pair constitutes a unit of currency. One then reports that pair to the centralized servers which share that report. One number is kept private, the other shared. By virtue of the mathematical operation, strangers cannot guess your private number from the reported, public, number from the pair you've found. To exchange currency, you again perform some operation on your numbers that can only be done if somebody knows the secret portion of your number pair. The results of that operation are reported publicly which transfers the unit of currency to the other person. That exchange mechanism is called blockchain. Locating number pairs is called mining.

I did genetic work on fungi in college and I watched this happen under the microscope (a dissecting stereoscope actually). It's very cool. In order to control where we put the spores, we used buffer solutions with a teeny amount of surfactant in them, a surfactant is soap.  The soap makes the spores stay suspended in the water. I use this secret to wash fruits that are prone to fungal infections like strawberries and blueberries. I fill my sink with lots of cold water (\\~ 2-4 gal) and then add 3 drops of Dawn dishwashing liquid. Then I pour in the berries and swirl them around removing the overtly infected ones.

    "answer": "It was deemed too dangerous. Ground effects give very strong downforce when they work ie there is little clearance and a good \"seal\". The big problem is that it has an almost digital effect - it is either working really well and then it doesn't work at all once the \"seal\" is broken. This was the old days when the seal was actually a flap along the side of the car.  The safety issue is that cars could go into corners REALLY fast with ground effect but if any unsettling occurs, say a slight bump on the road, the cars would immediately lose the ground effect and essentially take off (ie start to fly). There are several examples of that in F1 where the cars would start flying off the road and into competitors completely out of control.  Essentially, it was too unpredictable.",

Now there's a massive metal structure that acts as a sort of \"wall\" around the car (similar to a parachute).    The reason the cars would take off is because of the sudden, violent acceleration.  The cars would almost instantly lose control of the vehicle and start flying off the road.  This is why the FIA banned it in 2011.  It was deemed too dangerous.  So basically, the cars were just going to take off regardless of the \"seal\" and if it broke, they would just go flying.  I think the FIA was just trying to figure out how to make it safer for everyone involved.",

Space is only about 100 km away, but lifting things this far takes a huge amount of energy.  The equation for how much energy is simple, just mass (in grams) times the gravitational acceleration (10 m/s^(2)) times height in meters.  So if you want to lift a ton of garbage to space, you're looking at 1,000,000 g x 10 m/s^(2) x 100,000 meters = 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion) Joules of energy.  If we translate that into food, that becomes 239,000,000 kilocalories (same as dietary calories)  Basically this is the amount of energy used by about 120,000 humans in a day.  Or, put another way, 1 trillion joules is the amount of energy stored in 70 million aa batteries.

Long before there were drug cartels there were sugar cartels. The main reason why we have high fructose corn syrup is because the government decided that they wanted to prop up corn Farmers with subsidies and whenever corn products were no longer selling as much they had to come up with new ways and invent products where corn could be refined into other products such a sweeteners. The Western diet is over processed in nature due to the fact that it is cheaper than sourcing nutritious ingredients. Most people do not understand what nutrition is and if you sit around watching cable television then you will be brainwashed by commercials that revolve around terrible foods. All of these foods that are bad for you should not be sold the way that they are and societies should put into place protections that stop people from exploiting other people for profit in these manners.

I'm not saying that corn is bad for you, I'm saying that it's bad for the environment.  We have been using corn for a long time now, and it's been around for thousands of years. The US was the first country to industrialize corn, and they did it for a very long time before that.  The US is still a corn based economy, and the US is a corn dependent economy, so why haven't we done more to reduce the amount of corn we have produced and make it less expensive to produce?  I don't think that the US has done enough to combat the over-consumption of corn, but I do think that we have made a lot of progress in reducing the amount we eat.  If we could do that, we would have less sugar and more protein.  Also, I think the US government should do more to combat addiction.  Like, if we could make it illegal to buy a pack of chips with a single sugar packet, we could stop people from eating them.  Or if we had a federal law that made it illegal for people to sell cigarettes, they could be taxed for smoking.  There are tons of other things that could be done to stop people addicted to cigarettes, like mandating that they use a specific flavors of cigarettes, and that are bad for your body.  And I think we need to do more research into the effects of these things.  For example, I've read a lot about the effects on the brain and the immune system.

And the US government didn't care about the environment.  Because the US was a huge consumer of corn.  They didn't want the environment to be polluted by the excess of corn and they didn't like seeing the prices of corn go up.  So they subsidized corn. And that's why we have high fructose corn syrup.  It's not just sugar, it's also refined corn. The US is one of the few countries that doesn't have a huge corn production problem.  We have tons of corn, and we have tons more corn in the ground. We have been able to get more corn into our food by using sunflower seeds, rapeseed, and other sunflower products. We also have tons and tons of genetically modified corn. We just haven't figured out how to make the most of it yet.  I don't think the FDA has done a good job regulating the amount of corn that is grown in the US.  If they did, it would be a lot easier to make corn syrup without subsidies.  Instead, they have been doing it for years.  In the US, corn is a staple food. It's grown in record numbers, and the US is a huge producer of corn syrup, so it makes sense that they would want to make more.  But they didn. Instead, the US switched to corn syrup and other sweeteners.  When the US stopped subsidizing the corn industry, it didn't make a huge impact on the corn prices.  That was because the US corn farmers weren't doing well.  Now, they're making tons of money off of corn products.  With the switch to corn, they can make tons of new products. And they can sell them at a fraction of the price they were before.  What's stopping people from eating these new products is that they're not good for you.  You can't stop eating them. You can only stop eating one at a time.  Also, the FDA is in the process of regulating sugar levels. They're trying to make it so that sugar is legal in food.  There's a lot of misinformation out there about how much sugar is in sugar.  Most people do not understand what nutrition is and if you sit around watching cable television then you will be brainwashed by commercials that revolve around terrible foods.  Do you know what the FDA's website says about sugar?  It says that sugar has been banned in food for a decade.  How many people are watching cable tv?  I'm not sure.",
      "I think the best answer I've ever read about sugar is that it's addictive. I've been in a relationship for a while and I've always thought that's what sugar is. I'm not sure if it's true but I've never felt the urge to eat sugar again. I think it's a marketing thing, I don't know if it has anything to do with nutrition. I feel like I'm being brainwashed by the media and I'm watching a lot of ads for sugar. I wonder if there's any real benefits to cutting back on sugar.",
      ">Most people do not understand what nutrition is and if you sit around watching cable television then you will be brainwashed by commercials that revolve around terrible foods.    I think that's a fair statement.  I'm not advocating for a complete ban on sugar, but I do believe that we should have regulations on how much sugar is allowed in our food.  For example, in the US, we have a sugar tax.  This was introduced in the 1930s to combat the sugar crisis.  Ever since then, there have been a lot of sugar scandals and people have been making a lot more money off of it.  The US government has also done a lot to combat this problem.  In the 1930's, there was a sugar shortage.  There were tons of farmers that were getting crushed by the sugar harvest.  As a result of this, there were a lot fewer farmers selling their products.  Also, there used to be a lot less corn being grown.  Because of this decrease in corn production, there weren't as many farmers selling corn, so the amount of corn that was available for processing was lower.  So, the US stopped producing corn, and that meant that the prices of corn products went up.  That's when the sugar cartels started.  They basically got their hooks into the sweetener market, and they basically made a killing off of that.  Now, they're back to making tons of money off that. They're basically making tons and tons of sugar.  It's not a new thing.  Just look at how much corn is grown in the USA.  When there were no corn farmers, there wasn't a huge sugar crisis, and the price of corn went down.  Since then, the price has gone up again, and there's been no shortage of corn.  And that's why we have high fructose corn syrup.  We have tons of corn, which is a byproduct of the processing of corn into sugar. The sugar in corn is a key component of many sweeteners.  Once corn is processed, it's easy to add sugar to other sweeteners like tea, coffee, and tea.  These sweeteners are not good for you. They have been shown to have a negative effect on your body's glucose levels.  You can't stop eating them.  If you want to lose weight, you need to stop eating sugar. It's very hard to lose fat whenever you eat these foods because they cause inflammation, slow down metabolism, they wreak havoc on your insulin response, create what is known as the sugar trap (which is why sugary foods make you hungrier and hungrier).   If we could stop these things, we would have less insulin, and less inflammation, and more insulin.  Our bodies are also fighting a lot against the effects of stress.  Stress is a direct result of our eating.  Insulin is a hormone that we have to fight off.  Without it, we can't fight off hunger.  With the help of insulin, we fight off stress. Without it we can stop eating. Without insulin, our bodies are constantly trying to find ways to fight the urge to eat.  >We have protections stopping the exploitations of these neurochemical responses to terrible foods that are addictive.  What I'm saying is that we need to put protections in place that stop people exploiting other people for profit.  How do we stop people from exploiting other peoples for profit?  I don't know about you, but my family is in the process of going through a divorce. We have a lot going on. We're going through some really bad financial shit. We've been through a lot. We are in debt. We need to make sure that we can pay off our debt.  My family is struggling to make ends meet.  But I don\u2019t understand why we can\u2019T stop eating these foods.",

While I was able to negotiate $10K under MSRP, she was offered a $20K deal with 0% financing. I was like, what? I'm not paying $20k for a car that's going to cost me $30K in repairs and taxes. I'm paying $30k for the car that I'm going to owe $40K in interest. She was offered $25K under contract, which she accepted. She then went to the dealership and was told that she had to pay $30,000 in cash or take a loan. She chose the loan. The dealership then proceeded to tell her that she could get $3000 in cash back plus a $500 down payment on the car. She said no, and she was told she had no choice but to take the loan or pay $40,000 back. She agreed. She took the money back and said she would pay back the $30000 in interest later. She told me that she was really upset that she couldn't get a better deal. She felt like she had absolutely no power in negotiating and she needed a car to commute to work. She had no idea that she would have to pay back $3050 in interest on the loan in two years. She just wanted a car. The dealer told her that they could do whatever they wanted with the money she had. She signed a contract with them that said she could pay back as much as she wanted. She accepted the deal. The next day she called me and said that she got a phone call from the dealership saying that she lost the deal and that she has to pay off the loan immediately. She explained that she didn't want to pay the $20,000 that she agreed to. She wanted to pay for the $25,000 car with cash. She didn't know that she'd have to take a chance on a bad deal with a car dealer. She thought that she might get a deal with zero interest. The deal was a bad one. She got a deal that was worse than she expected. She paid $3030 in cash. The car was a total loss. She couldn't afford to pay more than $30.00 in repairs. She also had to deal with the fact that she missed her deadline for her loan.  She had to take on a new car loan. And she had a lot of stress. She basically had to make a choice between paying $40k in cash and paying off a car loan with 0 interest.   She chose to take whatever deal the dealership offered. She ended up paying $2500 in debt. She negotiated a deal for $25k. She made a deal to pay less than $20000 in total. She still had to live with the consequences. She lost $3040 in debt, but she had her choice.

This is a misconception. In reality each of these receptors responds partially to all light waves in the visible range.  So if you have 3 eyes, each of them has 3 different types of receptors, and each of those receptors is activated by a single photon, you can see 3 different colors in a single light wave.  But if you take 3 different photons, and you put them in a room with a different colored light source, you'll see 3 distinct colors in the same room.  This happens because each of the 3 receptors responds to a different frequency of light, and the light is transmitted via different paths.

When we see a rainbow, our brain is doing a relatively complex computation - it looks at how much each cone is activated, and compares this to situational things like what color the illuminating light appears to be in a scene.  The problem is that our brain already knows that the rainbow is red. So it uses those three colors as a basis for making decisions about other colors.  So if we see the rainbow, we're already making assumptions about what colors make sense, and it's using those assumptions to make a decision about what color to see.

    "answer": "In fact they dont. Ingrown hairs simply are seen as forein object and thus needed to be isolated and/or eliminated. This is one of the jobs of our white blood cells. Sadly most of these cells have a very short lifespan (around 2 days) and when their \"corpses\" accumulate they create pus. Inflammation appears whenever our white blood cells discover something \"not right\": it is like ringing a local alarm, while pus appears when lots of white cells, called by the alarm, gather for a long time and then die in the area. So, while these mechanisms do appear durning infections, it doesnt mean that when they do there is an actual infection. Simply this time the foreign object instead of being a bacteria is a looong string of chitin (the hair). The white cells continue to attack it trying to remove it and in the end just die around it. (They dont know that they are doing an useless/harmful work, they just react as programmed)",

This is a misconception.  The white cells don't actually attack the hair, they destroy it.  They are called to kill it. This is one of our white cell jobs, our white working cells.  But when they are called, they are not doing any useful work.  In fact, they kill the hair.  Why?  Because they are programmed to kill the foreign object.  Because that is what they are supposed to do.  And because that is the job they are given.  So when they attack the foreign hair, it is because they are being called to do that job.  That is why pus appears.  It is because the white cells are called upon to kill that foreign object, and because that job is what their job is.  This doesn't mean that the hair is a bad thing.

It's a bit of a paradox, but it's actually quite simple. When you hear a train whistle, it's usually the same sound as when you're watching it on TV, but the sound is compressed as it travels towards you, so it's making it sound higher-sounding as it goes along. When the train goes away, it'll be the same as if it were traveling at normal speed, but because it's moving away, its sound will be different.  This is called redshift.  It happens when we look out into space and see a galaxy, and it's called the Doppelfrequenz.  The reason it happens is because the light is moving away from us, and the light molecules are moving away with it. So the light in the universe is stretching, and that's why it's redshifting.  If you hear the sound of a train, it will be the exact same as when it's coming towards you. But if you hear it going away, you'll notice that it's not quite as loud.  That's because the sound waves are moving apart, and so the sound isn't traveling at the same speed as it was before.

If you run a direct wire between the live and ground prongs of your outlet, there is little to impede their flow and you get a flood of electrons - breakers in your house shut off power when this happens.  Devices limit their current draw in different ways. Basic resistive components have a resistance - they are highly imperfect conductors and so electrons encounter a lot of resistance as they try to move. This hinders the flow. One of the most basic equations you'll find in electronics is V=IR, which describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.  Other devices may use inductive or capacitive limits - AC power is constantly trying to change, and these components can limit it by either requiring or resisting change - unlike a resistor these do not turn energy into heat and so are more efficient.  More modern supplies switch on and off. By switching on and off faster or slower, we can limit how much power flows through without bulky capacitors or inductors and without the waste of resistors. Semiconductor technology has made this solution very cheap.  There are many more methods, but that's the basics.",

This is a misconception.  Current is a direct voltage.  The problem is that when you put a direct current (say 5V) through a resistor, the resistance decreases. This hinders the flow.  So how does the circuit know how much current it needs?    The answer is that it measures the resistance of the wire and then calculates the current flow through the device.  This can be done by measuring the resistance and the current current through the resistor, or by measuring how fast the current is flowing through the circuit.  If the resistor is too low, then the device will not be able to handle the current.  But if the resistor has a resistance of 100V, then how does it know how fast it is flowing?

The tl;dr is not to worry about it if you're not a mathematician.  Basically angular displacement is a rotation. And rotations don't commute. Which means they can't be vectors because mathematicians have said that one of the rules for vectors is that they have to commute under addition. So you can't use vectors, you have to use matrices.  Could we define vectors in a different way? Sure. But mathematicians have gone with that.  There are a few things like this where things that we treat as vectors or think of as vectors (outside mathematics) don't fit the strict definitions of vectors, but provided we don't tell the mathematicians it is all fine. Angular velocity and magnetic fields, for example, don't strictly meet the mathematical definition of a vector, but they are close enough that no one else cares - in these examples the things don't transform the 'right' way under reflections or similar transformations. Rotations are even worse at pretending to be a vector than these things, so the difference is a bigger deal.  The infinitesimal angular displacement is \"allowed\" to be a vector(ish) because it does commute up to second order terms. So if it is small enough the difference isn't noticeable.",

Also, Technically speaking The earth is not a perfect sphere. It's an oblate spheroid, or a kind of squashed sphere.

    "question": "ELI5: how do videogame engines affect the quality of the graphics?",
    "answer": "The definition of a game engine is essentially: what you have left over if you take the game out of the game. It's all the behind-the-scenes stuff that makes everything work. You look at the screen and see a picture of a dragon - that's the game. Somebody had to draw a dragon and put that in the game. What about the code that turns the drawing into 3D pixels? That's the engine.   So the engine is actually the majority of the code in the \"game\". It's not surprising it affects almost everything.   Yes, every engine has its upper limits. Something like the original Doom, for example, was designed to run on a DOS computer in 1994 or whatever, and it takes a lot of shortcuts for speed, and has a lot of limitations to make those shortcuts work. You can't look up or down in the original Doom. And the monsters aren't even 3D. Those are the limitations people accepted in exchange for getting it to work at all.  Sometimes there are fundamental design tradeoffs. For example, Factorio has a multiplayer mode. There's a lot of stuff happening in a Factorio game and it would be laggy if the server had to keep telling every player what was happening around them. So what it actually does is each player's computer runs the entire game and they stay synced up. But this means you can't have anything in the game that's random, because they'd get out of sync. Even things that seem random aren't actually random. It also means every player's computer needs to download a copy of the entire game world, when they log in. And it means if anyone's computer is too slow to run the game at normal speed, everyone gets slowed down, or that person gets kicked out.  So you can either have multiplayer that isn't laggy, **or** people with slow computers can play multiplayer, but not both. And changing from one to the other means rewriting the whole multiplayer part of the game from scratch. If you show someone a game that's designed to avoid the lag and ask how slow computers can play multiplayer without slowing everything down, the answer is they can't. It's not that it's impossible; it's just impossible *in that engine design with the fast multiplayer*. If you changed it it wouldn't be the same multiplayer engine any more. Hope this helps.",

You can transform vectors by multiplying matrices by them, for example a rotation of 180 degrees in 2D can be represented by the matrix  |\\-1|0| |:-|:-| |0|\\-1|  If you multiply any vector by this matrix then it will rotate it around 180 degrees.  Now most matrices aren't that simple and they will do a combination of operations, changing the length and direction of vectors in complex ways.For a given matrix an eigenvector is one which doesn't have its direction changed, i.e only its length is scaled when you multiply it by that matrix. The eigenvalue is how much that length is scaled.  For example if we have some matrix M and a vector (3,5). Then say we multiply M\\*V and get a new vector (6,10) which = 2\\*(3,5).

    "answer": "It is not unusual for vaccines to require multiple stabs for full efficiency. After the first injection you get a strong response from the immune system that will be able to get rid of the vaccine. But you only get a partial respons from the memory cells that is responsible for helping the immune system recognizing future infections. So another injection as the first immune response have died down can help increase the number of memory cells. As for why there is exactly 3 weeks between the stabs for the BioNTech vaccine is because that was what they used in their stage 3 trial so that is what have been certified. Most of the vaccines we administer have had a lot of testing to figure out how they are most efficient while they wait for the paperwork to complete. But for vaccines like the coronavirus vaccines as well as the seasonal flu we do not have time for this so we just make educated guesses and run trials to make sure this is safe and effective.  There are lots of indications suggesting that the BioNTech vaccine works just fine with just one shot. The trial can be interpreted as low as 65% efficiency after three weeks but some suggest this might be as high as 98% after five weeks with just one stab. And some countries are delaying the second injection in order to make sure as many people as possible have the first injection as soon as possible.",

      "> After the first injection you get a strong response from the immune system that will be able to get rid of the vaccine. But you only get a partial response from your body, because the vaccine is inactivated before it enters your cells.   This is because the immune cells are no longer working properly. The vaccine is still inactivated, but the immune response has died down.  This happens when the vaccine enters the cells, and it's not until after the second injection that the immune systems can fully react to the vaccine, so it's a case of \"if you have the vaccine and the vaccine works, it will work\".    The reason why there is exactly 3 weeks between the stabs for the BioNTech vaccine is because that was what they used in their stage 3 trial so that is what have been certified.  The trial was done in the US, and the US is the only country that has a protocol in place for this type of clinical testing.  According to the FDA, the protocol is \"effective at 95% of the doses given.\"   Based on this, the FDA has issued a \"no marketing\" order for the vaccine to be distributed in the U.S.  However, the agency is still waiting for the paperwork to be completed.

      ">There is no such thing as \"at the same time\" for things far away or moving very fast.   What you mean is that it's impossible for two objects to be *at* the same place at the same exact time.  For example, if you have two objects in the same room, one is moving away from the other, and the two objects are moving towards each other.  But if you take two objects that are moving away at the exact same speed, one object will pass by the other one, and both objects will pass through the other. So if you look at two objects at the very same time, one will pass in front of the other and both will pass behind.  So if two objects move at the speed of light, one of them will pass between the other before the other object can see them.  This is called the \"paradigm paradox\".",

But time is a tricky thing, because it is and isn't. It is a thing that exists between things that exist. If you have an empty cube with absolutely nothing in it, no particles no interacting forces, there is no time in it. Time exists between two things that interact.   For an observer to say that something has happened, it can only measure it from it's perspective so time comes in to existence from our perspective. If it can't interact with us or we can't observe it, the time starts existing in practical sense. Yes it can exist between other things, but only thing that matters is the observer and the other thing. Even if there isn't a direct link to observe or for interaction, there can be indirect thing, in which case time comes in to existence through the chain that leads all to way to the even itself.   I don't know if it makes it any easier, but stuff like this becomes way easier to understand when you accept the fact that time is not a thing, while also being a thing.

The amount of factors that play a part in weight gain and weightloss is extremely variable and can be very difficult to pin down.  \"The amount of factor that plays a part\" in weight loss is a very difficult question to pin point.  There are many factors that go into weight gain, including hormones, hormones, and genetics.  It's important to note that the amount of variables that play into weight loss can change over time, and can have a huge impact on weight loss.  For example, insulin levels can be affected by the amount that you eat, and the amount you drink per day.  These factors can affect your weight and your insulin levels.  This can have very negative effects on your health and well being.  If you are overweight, you need to be on insulin to combat your weight.  With insulin, you can lower your insulin level and lose weight. If you have diabetes, you may need to take insulin to lower your glucose levels. If your diabetes is severe, you might need to stop insulin and switch to a lower glucose diet.  All of these factors can play a role in weight-loss, but the key factor is the amount and type of insulin you are taking.  Take insulin, and you can lose weight without having to take any insulin.  You can also take prednisone, which is a powerful anti-diabetic drug.  Taking insulin can help you lose weight, but it can also make you more sick.  I'm not advocating for either of these approaches.  But I'm saying that there is a lot more evidence-backed research that shows that the best way to lose weight is to be active and eat less.

    "question": "Eli5: why is it so easy to make heat but so hard to make cold?",
    "answer": "The comments are mostly right, but I wanted to try to simplify it even more. The question is, what is heat? The easiest way to think about heat is if we're talking about a gas made up of a bunch of atoms. Temperature in this system is a measure of how much those atoms jiggle. If they're jiggling a lot, then they're very hot. If they're not jiggling much, then it's cold. If you touch a hot gas, the atoms in the gas hit your hand very quickly and cause the atoms in your hand to jiggle from all the impacts. If you light a match, the energy from the match causes the atoms to jiggle even more meaning it's heating up more. If you throw a ball in the gas, every atom it hits gains energy, and then hits a bunch of other atoms causing the entire gas to gain jiggling while slowing down the ball (air friction).  Now how do you remove the jiggling from the gas? There is a concept in physics called entropy. Smashing an egg on the ground is very easy to do. Putting the egg back together again takes a lot of time and effort. Similarly, getting a billion gas molecules to jiggle is easy. Getting them all to stop jiggling is very hard and takes effort.

If you throw a ball in the gas, every atom it hits gains entropy (because of the friction) and then hits a bunch of other atoms causing the entire gas to gain jiggled while slowing down the ball (air friction).    This is called the law of conservation of entropy.   If you take a ball and put it in a vacuum, the air will pull the ball out, leaving the gas intact.  But if you put the ball in a liquid, the gas will still retain its state, even if the air is pulling away.  This means that the gas is still a solid, even though the ball is no longer holding it.  The question is, how do we remove the gas from the state?   The answer is, with enough effort, you can make it cold.",
      "So if I understand correctly, when you put an egg on the ground it will break apart?",
      "I'm not sure I understand this at all, but I'm trying to understand it.  If you put an egg on the ground and smash it, the molecules will all come together again. But if you put a ball on the same surface and smash the egg, the gas will still come together. How do you remove the gas?",
      "So if you can get the atoms to stop jiggling, then how do you make cold?",
      "Thanks for the explanation!    I'm still confused about the whole \"jiggling\" thing.  I thought entropy was a measure of how much heat is being produced by the gas, not the amount of heat being produced.   Is that why it's so hard to heat a gas with a ball?",
      "Thanks for the explanation!   I'm still a little confused about the jiggling part though. If you put an egg on the ground and rub it with your hand, it should instantly stop jiggled. But if you rub it again, it won't stop. Is there a way to remove the jiggle without destroying the egg?",
      "Thank you for the explanation! I was stuck at the beginning with the jiggling part, so I'm going to try to simplify it a bit.    If you take a jiggled gas and put it in a vacuum, the gas will instantly become cold, no matter how hard you try to cool it down. How does this happen?   The answer is that the jiggle is the energy being released by the gas molecules, and the amount of energy being produced by the jangling is what causes the cold.  If the gas is jiggly, then it's cold. If it's not jiggle, then the cold is coming from the air molecules themselves.  So how do we cool it off?  By using a vacuum that is extremely cold (because of the lack of heat), and then putting the gas back together again.  This is called the vacuum method.  The process of cooling the gas down is called \"entanglement\", and it's a bit of a paradox.  When you put a vacuum in a room with a jiggle, the air is already cold, so it's already cooling down. But when you put the vacuum in an open room with no jiggles, it's still cold. So how does it get back to being cold?  The solution is to use a vacuum with a high pressure, and by using a high vacuum, you can cool the gas off completely.  But that's only if you have a vacuum large enough to contain the jizzling gas. If you don't, then you have to open the vacuum and let the air out through a small window.  That's where entropy comes in.  It's the energy that's being released from the jangled gas, and it comes from the fact that the gas itself is jangled.  With a vacuum big enough to hold the jaggling gas, it can cool down completely. If the vacuum is too small, then all the jagged gas molecules are still warm.  And if you open the air up, the jagging gas can cool off again.",

    "question": "ELI5: If lightning takes the shortest path to the ground, why is it all jagged-like in the sky, and not a straight line?",
    "answer": "How a lightning bolt (or any electric arc) forms:  1. Two opposite charge distributions build up in the clouds and ground, creating a voltage between the two and therefor an electric field distributed in the space between them.  2. In some area, usually near a sharp point in one of the charge distributions, the electric field exceeds the breakdown strength of air, stripping electrons from the air molecules and causing that area to become conductive.  3. Charge from the charge distribution flows into this area until it is at the same voltage. That small patch of volume is now a conductive extension of the charge distribution.  4. There is now the same voltage between the two charge distributions, and at a slightly smaller distance, further concentrating the electric field between the two, which will lead to further breakdown of the air.  5. This process repeats continuously until a full conductive path of ionized air is created between the charge distributions. At which point the entirety of the charge will flow and the two opposite charge distributions will neutralize each other. As the charge is depleted, the electric field will weaken, and no new paths will be formed, first path to ground wins.  So why is the path jagged?  If you took two metal plates, one at 0v and one at 12v, there would be an electric field evenly distributed between them. Now if you took a third plate at 0v and put it between the other two, the electric field would be concentrated between the middle plate and the 12v plate, the presence of the middle plate has deprived the outer 0v plate of its surrounding electric field.  It works similarly in lightning, streamers lower to the ground will block the progress of streamers above, streamers to the sides of other streamers will tend to redirect them away. Each one at any instant will progress in the direction of the strongest electric field, and they will influence each other\u2019s electric fields to point away from each other.  The geometry of the charge distributions and the shape of the streamers at any instant during the process will ultimately determine the path of lightning.  The \u201cpath of least resistance\u201d explanation is not true and this isn\u2019t even rigorously well defined when you think about it. The charge distributions will build up along the surfaces facing each other, you could pick two points on these surfaces and find the path between them which has the smallest line integral of resistivity along it. But which two points? The answer will be different for different points. And the resistivity of the various sections of air is dynamically changing as the conductive path is being formed, so the path of least resistance is constantly changing too. Not to mention the resistivity of air should only be dependent on its temperature, pressure and humidity which will not vary so much for neighboring patches of air, so you wouldn\u2019t expect such a jagged path if it was truly resistance driving the process. It would be a straight line or have a slight but smooth curve to account for the changing pressure, temperature and humidity as a function of altitude.  So it\u2019s not the path of least resistance, it\u2019s a complex result of the instantaneous geometry of the charge distributions and current locations of the other streamers which will guide a streamer in one direction or the other. I don\u2019t think there is a simple way to characterize the path which lightning will ultimately take in any given situation.",
    "follow-up": "So the streamers are being guided by the charge distributions, which keeps changing.  Or in other words, takes the path of least electrical resistance.

Anything that causes the neurons in your taste buds to begin firing off randomly will produce a metal taste.  The reason that we associate the taste with metal is because the most common way to cause temporary dysfunction in your taste buds is by putting something made out of metal in your mouth.  Metal itself has no taste.  When you put a metal object in your mouth you're creating an environment that is very similar to a weak battery.  This creates a very slight electrical current within your mouth, triggering the neurons in your taste buds to malfunction.  Your brain doesn't doesn't know how to process that information and you end up tasting \"error\".    The reason that we associate the taste of \"error\" with that of metal is because sticking something metal in your mouth is a pretty common occurrence for most kids - so its pretty likely that the first time you taste \"error\" will be the result of putting metal in your mouth.  There isn't a whole lot other than metal that will produce an error taste, so because the only experience most people will have had with the taste is sticking a metal object in their mouth, they associate the taste with metal.  One of the few other things that will cause the taste buds in your mouth to malfunction is high levels of radiation.

    "question": "ELI5: How does light travel in space?",
    "answer": "Sound is what happens when the particles in a material push against each other in a wave. Honestly, it\u2019s very similar to just waves you would see in the ocean. Particles bunch up into a wave, and then spread out between the waves.   Light on the other hand, is what happens when the electromagnetic field oscillates.   To explain that a bit more, imagine a magnet. When you hold the magnet near a piece of iron, the iron will get pulled towards the magnet. The strength of the pull depends on how far away the magnet is though. If the magnet is basically touching the iron, it gets pulled really hard, but if the magnet is on the other side of the room, it hardly pulls the iron at all.   That \u201cpull\u201d is analogous to the magnetic field. When the iron is being pulled strongly, the magnetic field put out by the magnet is strong at the iron\u2019s location. When the iron is hardly being pulled, the magnetic field is pretty weak. As a disclaimer, this isn\u2019t a completely accurate way to picture the magnetic field, since it also has a direction, but it\u2019s close enough.   Now, that \u201cpull\u201d doesn\u2019t have to travel through any matter. It\u2019s not like the magnet is sending a pulse through the air telling the iron to come towards it. The magnetic field fills up all of \u201cempty\u201d space, so a magnet could pull iron even in empty space, without any air.   Now, another thing to understand is that the magnetic field, what we were just talking about, and the electric field, which makes charged particles attract/repel each other, are connected. The important bit here is that when a magnetic field changes, it causes the electric field nearby to change as well.   That means that if you cause a change in the magnetic field, say by moving a magnet away, that change will cause a pulse in the electric field.   Where it gets weird is that changes in the electric field do the same thing. When you change the electric field, it will cause a magnetic field to appear.   So, let\u2019s say you move a magnet away quickly. That will cause the magnetic field in the area to drop off suddenly. That change in the magnetic field will make a pulse in the electric field just ahead of it. But now, if the electric field just pulsed, that means it changed, and a changing electric field causes a magnetic field. So that pulse in the electric field causes its own pulse in the magnetic field just ahead. Again though, the magnetic field just changed, so you get an electric pulse. The electric pulse causes a magnetic pulse, which causes an electric pulse, which causes a magnetic pulse, which causes\u2026  Anyway, you can see how that makes a wave of changing electric and magnetic fields propagate along through space.   Btw, wiggling a magnet does actually make light, but you can\u2019t wiggle it fast enough to make visible light, sadly. You can make some really low energy radio waves though!  **TL;DR** *Light isn\u2019t a matter wave, it\u2019s an electromagnetic wave that propagates through electric and magnetic fields. \u201cEmpty\u201d space isn\u2019t actually empty, and it still has those fields in it, so light can wiggle its way through those fields to travel in space*",

    "answer": "\\[EDIT: Oh wow! My first silver! Thank you, you glorious human! OMG! Two silvers! You people are simply majestic!\\]  I work as a Library Tech at a large metropolitan library. My dept does the purchasing and assignment to branches of purchased items - books, ebooks, audiobooks, CDs, DVDs, you name it.  The short answer is that publishers don't sell the electronic items to libraries, they license them with certain conditions; To offer 6 copies for circulation we have to buy 6 licenses, usually at a rate much higher than you could buy it through Amazon. Each of these licenses are single-use, meaning only one check-out at a time is allowed.  But wait! There's more!  Part of the purchase license is a limit to how many times that one licensed ebook can be circulated - and that's often a rather small number. So those 6 copies/licenses, maybe each can only circ 10 times, so really we only get 60 circs out of it. If the ebook is popular and the item keeps getting reserves on it, then we have to keep buying licenses.  Now our regular paper books, which we buy at a price just higher than retail (often reinforced bindings) can circ 20 or more times before they fall apart, so the license model means we pay significantly more per circ.  For us, as a library, and ebook, audiobook, or any other electronic item ISN'T any different that a paper book. We catalog and track them in exactly the same way. Not because it's easier or anything, but because book/item circulation is the most important metric we use in both funding and budget planning. When you do several million circs per year it's nescessary info.  If you're interested in the effect e-publishers have had on public libraries I wrote a post in r/books a couple months ago [related to ebooks](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/lj0ej2/publishers_need_to_know_that_if_readers_have_to/gnav1o4/?context=3).",

Is it a percentage? Is there a limit? Is the number allowed to be checked out a certain number of times?  I'm not sure how to quantify this, but I'm guessing it's something like a percentage of the total circulation.",

I work as a Library Tech at a large metropolitan library. My dept does the purchasing and assignment to branches of purchased items - books, audiobooks, DVDs, you name it.  We also do the circulation for those items.  The licensing is the same as the purchasing.  But what happens when a library buys a license for a paper copy of a book? What happens if the book is not a big seller? What if the library only has a few thousand copies?   The license is the key to all of this.  If a library wants to offer a license, it has to buy 6 copies for circulation. Each of these licenses are single-use, meaning only one check-out at a time is allowed.  So if a library has 10,000 copies of a particular book, and it only has 6 licenses, it can only circ 10 times.  And if a single copy circs 20 times, it's out of luck.  That's why we have a limit on how many copies of each ebook we can offer.  It's not that the number of copies is limited, it is that the amount of times each copy can be offered is limited.  Each copy can only be offered for circulation once.  This means that if a book is offered for free, it cannot be offered to anyone else.  Also, if a publisher offers a license to distribute a book for free to a library that has a limit of 10 copies, it must also offer a limit to how many times that one licensed ebook can be circulated - and that's often a rather small number.  In other words, if the publisher offers 6 copies of their ebook for free and the library buys another 6 copies, the library can only offer another 6 licenses.  Now, if you take a book that's available for free for a limited time, and you buy another copy for a price that's similar to the first one, you can only circulate that copy 20 times. So those 6 copies/licenses, maybe each can only get 60 circs out of it, so really we only get 300 circs.  What happens then?  The ebook becomes a sort of \"goldmine\" for the library. If the ebook is popular and the item keeps getting reserves on it, then we have to keep buying licenses. But if the ebook isn't popular, then the licenses expire.  Every single copy of the ebook gets sold, and the libraries have to renew them.  All of this is tied to the number that the book circulates.  I'm not saying that the licenses are bad, just that the licensing is tied.  You can't just say \"no more!\" and say \"thanks for the response!\"",

But if I want to buy a lot of ebooks at once and circulate them 1000 times, and each copy circulates 1000 times again, I have a limit of 10 licenses.  This is why ebooks are so popular with librarians, because they are so easy to renew.  However, when you have a limited number of licenses, it can be very costly to renew multiple copies at once.  Because each license is a different size, and the number can be different for each book.  Also, when I look at the number that can be circulated, I see that the number is usually around 300,000.  And that's just for the first 500,000 or so copies.  If I look back at the first 300,00 copies, I realize that I only got 60 licenses. So if the ebook is a big seller, and I buy a bunch of copies, and they only circ 10 times and renew them every 1000 times (or so), then I only get 300 licenses. And that is only because of the limit of the first 1000 copies. So the second 500,00 or so are sold to other people, and so on.  I'm not sure how many copies of each book can be distributed if I just buy a few hundred copies and renew it every 1000 circs.  That's why I'm asking about the licensing.",

    "question": "ELI5: Can somebody explain to me bullet calibers?",
    "answer": "The other two comments nailed the whole metric versus imperial thing, but its actually a fair bit more complex than that. Never fear, I'm your friendly neighborhood gun guy.  \"50 cal\" is a term that most people attribute to .50 BMG, but .50 BMG is definitely not the only .50 caliber cartridge. The reason that most calibers have either a military designation (5.56x45mm, 7.62x39mm) or a word after the caliber designation is because no two calibers are exactly the same.  In the case of x.xx*xx mm, those are military designations, usually NATO. They denote the diameter of the bullet, and the length of the brass case. But for more Imperial calibers, you'll see \".30-06 Springfield,\" \".270 Winchester,\" \".223 Remington,\" \"9mm Parabellum,\" \".45 ACP,\" etc.  The diameter of the bullet is a small part of the equation. For example, there is 9x19mm, aka 9mm Parabellum, or just 9mm. But there are tons of calibers with a 9mm diameter bullet. .380 Auto, .357 Magnum, 9x18 Makarov, 9x39 Soviet, etc. The differences come from case length and design, and powder load. More powder with the same bullet means more force on target.  You would be correct in saying, \".45 ACP is a bigger bullet than 5.56.\" But 45 ACP is designed for handguns, and as such has a shorter case and smaller powder load. This helps keep the guns, well, handguns, and helps with controllability under recoil.  There are probably thousands of \"30 cal\" calibers in this world, and they do not all perform the same, and most likely won't fit and fire safely in guns not specifically marked for them.  .50 BMG is probably the largest caliber that you can own without filling out paperwork for a Destructive Device from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Because somebody decided at some point that any firearm with a bore larger than half an inch was essentially a cannon.  When looking at terminal ballistics (how good is this bullet at breaking that thing), you have to take into consideration bullet size, bullet weight, and powder load at a minimum. 9mm has a smaller powder load than 45 ACP, and pushes a smaller bullet (about half the weight) about 30% faster. 5.56 on the other hand, is basically pushing a .22 at 2800-3100 feet per second, around 3x as fast as the 9mm.  What could help you greatly in your understanding is to go on the interwebs and find a picture of a few calibers side by side. The difference in power should be self explanatory with a visual  Try this as a resource: https://www.pewpewtactical.com/bullet-sizes-calibers-and-types/",

Also, the fact that the NATO designation is interchangeable with the other imperial calibers is a bit of a mystery.

There are probably thousands of \"30 cal\" calibers in this world, and they do not all perform the same, and most likely won't fit and fire safely in guns not specifically marked for them.  So, if you can find a suitable firearm for a particular caliber, it's probably not the best time to buy it.",
      "Thanks for your answer!  I was under the impression that the difference between imperial and imperial calibers was the diameter of the bullet, but I'm learning that it's actually more complex than that.   For example, the NATO designation for the 9mm is x.xx mm. But for more Imperial calibers, you'll see \".30-06 Springfield,\" \".270 Winchester,\" \"9mm Parabellum,\" \".45 ACP,\" etc.  I'm not sure if those are interchangeable terms, or if they're just more generalizations.  If you're a collector of firearms, you might want to check out the.30-56 Springfield Armory, or the Springfield Armory Museum.",
      ">When looking at terminal ballistics, how good is this bullet at breaking that thing), you have to take into consideration bullet size, bullet weight, and powder load at a minimum.  I'm not a firearms expert, but I'm a guy who shoots a lot of guns. I'm pretty familiar with the basics of firearms and the differences between the different calibers. I've seen the differences in power and muzzle velocity, but the actual bullet size and powder loading is what I'm confused about.  For example, the difference in power should be self explanatory with a visual  How does the caliber of the bullet affect the velocity?",
      ">In the case of x.xx mm, those are military designations, usually NATO.    I'm not sure what you mean by that.  I've seen NATO markings on a lot of guns, but I'm pretty confused about what they mean.  For example, the NATO markings are usually on a rifle, and usually on the buttstock.  But for more Imperial calibers, you'll see \".30-06 Springfield,\" \".270 Winchester,\" \"9mm Parabellum,\" \".45 ACP,\" etc.  So what you're saying is that the imperial markings on guns are just a marketing tool to sell more guns, and that the differences between the imperial and imperial calibers are mostly marketing.  That's not necessarily true.  The reason that most calibers have either a military designation (5.56x45mm) or a word after the caliber designation is because no two calibers were exactly the same. They denote the diameter of the bullet, and the length of the brass case.  And the diameter is only one part of the equation.  If you're looking at the actual power of a bullet, you have to take into consideration bullet size, bullet weight, and powder load at a minimum.  With the exception of the.22 Magnum, which is a.308, the only thing that really separates the two calibres is the powder load.  A.308 Magnum will typically have a.30-30 Magnum caliber bullet, a.40 S&W Magnum caliber powder, and a.45 ACM caliber bullet.  These are all things that make the difference between the two.  In terms of actual power, the difference is pretty negligible. A.30 S& W Magnum will push a bullet through a wall at about 3200 feet per second. A.30-56 will push the same bullet through the wall at around 2200 feet.  This is because the.30 is a much more powerful gun than a.22.  By far the most powerful gun in the world.  It's the one that can handle the most bullets.  At 2200 yards per second, the.308 is basically pushing a.50 BMG at 2800 feet per Second.  You can't do that with a.38 Magnum.  Also, the fact that the.38 is a bit more powerful means that the bullets are more effective at penetrating through a gun's armor.  When looking at terminal ballistics, you can't just say \"wow, that's a really good gun. That's a lot more powerful than a 9mm.\"  That would be a lie. The only thing you can do is say \"that's a good gun.\"  And that's only true if you're shooting a.380 Magnum.",
      "I'm not a firearms enthusiast, but I'm a bit confused about the differences between imperial and imperial calibers.  I know that imperial is the same as imperial in terms of velocity, but what about the difference in power?",
      "So the difference between the imperial and imperial calibers is the bullet?",

      "Thank you for the explanation.  I was under the impression that the difference between imperial and imperial calibers was the bullet diameter, but I'm not sure about that.   I'm also under the assumption that imperial calibre refers to a firearm's barrel length, not its actual caliber.  So if I'm correct in saying that imperial is a firearm, then the difference in power is the bullet size, not the caliber.",

    "answer": "Computers follow a series of instructions. They do each step before performing the next. In a single-threaded environment, if one instruction takes a long time, it holds up the entire process.  Multithreading gives sets of instructions which can be run in parallel. If you have multiple CPUs or if the CPU has multiple cores, it can give each one its own set of instructions so they can really be done at the same time. Even if not, a single CPU can switch back and forth between multiple threads, making a little progress on one before switching to the other.  A standard example in programming is with the user interface. Say you click on a button that does some sort of long-running analysis. With a single-threaded application, as soon as you push the button, all the tasks used to keep the user interface responsive are held up. The button look like it is still pressed even after you let go of the mouse, and you can't move the window or press any other control in the interface until the analysis is complete. In a multi-threaded environment, the analysis would be put on another thread. It can do its thing while the thread that keeps the user interface responsive does its job as well.",

Using complex bio chemistry, these eels can either, charge up the cells, hold charge, or discharge.   When they discharge, they allow electrical difference to flow from one cell to another, but as they are in a line, the electrical difference will have to flow through the water, from one end of the line, to the other end.

However, sometimes you're unlucky and all the holes align. Everything is at the wrong place at the same time, and disaster happens.   Truth is, humans *will* make mistakes. It is unavoidable. Any attempts to reduce risk *will* cause risks of its own. The best we can do is to have many layers of cheese (safety mechanism) so that the chance of holes aligning (all safety mechanisms failing) is as small as possible. The desire to blame a single entity for disasters is not only wrong, but also makes the entire system prone to future disasters. If we only blame one slice of cheese for the entire disaster, problems in every other slice of cheese is not fixed, or even worse, those holes get larger due to complacency.",

This sort of fire was, with the benefit of hindsight, entirely predictable based on the pre existing conditions wasn't it?

This leads to a very bad conclusion: if we only blame one slice of the cheese for the entire disaster, problems in every other slice of chees is not fixed, or even worse, those holes get larger due to complacency.

If we look into it another direction, then maybe we're saying that one hole is to be blamed for the problem, but that's just a recipe that doesn't make sense.",

      "Thank you for the response!    I think I phrased my question poorly. I meant that I blame the entire system for the Grenfell fire, not just the individual.

You can then put them all in a grid and align them to make a safe cheese. However, if you put the cheese in a random grid, the holes will align randomly. This is what happened with the Grenfell Tower. The holes were all in random places, but somehow they all aligned.    This is a bad analogy because it makes it seem like there is some sort of \"one entity\" responsible for every single hole, even if there are multiple.  If you put a cheese in random rows, you can put the holes in the same order as the other slices, but if you do that, the cheese will still fall apart.  This makes it sound like there was some sort \"one cheese\" responsible, but there are no such things as one entity.  The problem is that if you have multiple slices of a cheese, you cannot put all the holes into the same grid. The problem arises when you put all of the cheese into a grid, but the holes are still randomly placed.  So if you had a single cheese, all the cheese would fall apart, but because there are so many different pieces, the problem is still not solved.  In this scenario, if we put the same cheese in multiple grids, the problems would still be there, but instead of being fixed by the various pieces of cheese at random, the flaws will be magnified.  And if we do that with multiple cheeses, the chances of the holes aligning with each other will be higher, because the holes aren't being filled in by the other pieces.  Also, if the holes were in random locations, they would not be able to be seen by the naked eye.",

But   I'm saying that if they're filming a scene with a lot of people on set, and they're carrying a coffee cup, it's probably worth risking their lives to get it as close to the camera as possible.  Like, if they were filming a fight scene, and one of the characters tripped over a prop and dropped the coffee cup on the set, it wouldn't be worth risking the lives of everyone on set.

It raises your cortisol levels, which is a stress hormone.  Your body uses cortisol to fight hunger. This means that if you eat too much, you will have more hunger. Eating too much will lead to more hunger, which will lead you to more food. Eating more will lead more food, which leads to more hungry. Eating less will lead us to more tired. Eating fewer food will lead back to hunger, and more hungry means more hungry, which means more hunger = more tired, more stressed, more tired = more stressed.  Eating more food means more food = more hunger which means less sleep. More stressed means more tired which means fewer hours of sleep.  More stressed people = more hungry = more angry.

There's no scientific evidence that probiotic helps stomaching issues, and no evidence that it doesn't.
